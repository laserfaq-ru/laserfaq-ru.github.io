<h2>Introduction to Amateur Laser Construction</h2>
<h3><A NAME="concit0">So You Think You Really Want to Build a Laser</A></h3>

While most lasers are extremely high tech devices which require the
engineering and manufacturing expertise of corporations, universities, or
Government agencies to design and construct, there are a few types that
can be built from scratch by the <i>very</i> determined amateur.  I'm not
talking about wiring a helium-neon laser tube to a power supply or a laser
diode to a driver circuit.  A truly home-built laser may start out as 4 foot
lengths of various sizes of glass tubing, mirrors, special gases and
chemicals, scrap metal and hardware; electronic components like transformers,
rectifiers, capacitors, and resistors - and laser and high voltage warning
signs!  Converting this collection of materials into a working laser will
require many many hours of effort as well as blood, sweat, and possibly
tears. :)
<p>
Considering the enormous gap between your likely capabilities and those
of a large corporation, the final result probably won't match a commercial
laser in either performance or appearance (though there are a few exceptions).
However, that shouldn't be the point of the exercise.  Rather, a laser (or
multiple lasers after you are hooked) should be built for the education,
challenge, and opportunity for experimentation afforded by dealing with all
aspects of laser construction.  And, the realization that the laser <i>you</i>
built is a complex precision device <i>you</i> were able to bring to fruition
successfully.
<p>
To the amateur scientist, experimenter, hobbyist, or even weekend tinkerer,
there is something about the idea of actually creating a working laser
that makes its construction from the ground up a very attractive and rewarding
project with "first light" - the instant that <i>your</i> home-built laser
first emits a coherent beam - approaching the excitement of a religious or
sexual experience!
<p>
Although the laser is a device or instrument based on fundamental quantum
mechanics which is very simple in principle - an excited medium between
mirrors - building one successfully may require mastering several disciplines
not normally found in even the high tech home.  These include: glass
working, vacuum systems, gas handling, high voltage electronics, and precision
mechanical fabrication.  Dealing with these can in itself be an excellent
educational experience.  Access to a university or industrial lab will make
things a lot easier but isn't essential - it is possible to build a laser
without outside assistance.  Academic studies in laser physics or related
subjects are also not necessary unless you want to attempt to do serious
research as all the lasers that can be reasonably constructed at home are
based on well established principles where rules-of-thumb and simple
calculations will suffice.  However, the cost of such an undertaking can
be significant - experience in scrounging is a definite asset!  And, the
construction of home-built lasers can be quite addictive and may impact other
activities like social interaction, eating, sleeping, and the timely
performance of other bodily functions. :)
<p>
In this chapter and the one that follows, we provide basic information on the
construction of various types of lasers from scratch including: home-built
laser safety, setting up a home laser lab, sources of supplies and chemicals,
vacuum systems, glass working, structural materials, power supplies, and more.
<p>
Then, a variety of specific types of home-built lasers are described in more
detail.  Much of this material is derived from the Scientific American
collection "Light and its Uses" [5] and from the email, Web sites, articles,
and experiences of those who have been successful in building their own lasers
from basic components and getting them to work (not taking the easy way out
and using commercial tubes or laser diodes!) - or have given it their best
shot trying!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Where there is a corresponding article in "Light and its Uses", a summary
 will be provided which includes the physical characteristics, power supply
 requirements, materials, chemicals and supplies, special equipment, and so
 forth - as well as an estimated level-of-difficulty (in a number of areas)
 needed to construct such a laser and get it to work.
<p>
 If you find that you are serious about any of this, obtaining a copy of this
 material is essential.  See the section: <A HREF="laserclt.htm#cltlau">Light
 and its Uses - Table of Contents</A> for a list of all the articles that
 constitute this valuable collection and an explanation of why I cannot
 provide on-line access to it.
<p>
<li>These chapters will also include additional information on the construction
 of each laser type, hints, tips, shortcuts, and alternative approaches and
 possible enhancements (some of which may not have been possible, economical,
 or even known when the original articles were published).  In addition,
 errata and suggestions for corrective action (changes in dimensions, gas
 fill, whatever) will be provided.
<p>
<li>Web links will be provided to known sites which describe the laser in more
 detail.  Email addresses of active amateur laser constructors will be
 included as well.
<p>
<li>Other resources like the Iannini books ([2] and [3]) will be identified if
 they provide construction plans.
<p>
<li>General information related to lasers other than the diode, HeNe, and Ar/Kr
 ion types covered extensively elsewhere in this document may also be found
 in these chapters.
</ul>
<p>
While this will not substitute the hands-on of actually having built one of
these lasers or detailed construction plans, it may provide the spark to get
you started!

<h4><A NAME="concit1">Reasons NOT TO Build a Laser from Scratch</A></h4>

First, let us consider some ill-posed justifications for attempting to build a
laser from (almost) raw materials:
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Something can be put together quickly."  Forget it.  Any of the types of
 lasers considered in this discussion will require many many hours, more like
 months, to locate the materials, chemicals, and other supplies and to
 construct, align, and get working - if you ever succeed at all.
<p>
 Furthermore, you will be CONSTANTLY fiddling with adjustments like gas fill,
 mirror alignment, power supply voltage/current.  In many cases, total laser
 lifetime is often short (a few hours) before a total rebuild is needed.
 These are not generally set-it-and-forget-it type equipment!  If you just
 want a working laser, this is definitely NOT the way to go.
<p>
<li>"Lasers are SO expensive."  Yes in many cases, but what you get is
 something that works (relatively) reliably with (relatively) minimal
 fiddling with adjustments.  In the end, you will likely spend more than you
 might think based on your initial estimates simply because you cannot go and
 buy just the quantity of materials or chemicals that you will need - 1 screw
 or 2 inches of pyrex glass 5 mm ID tubing or 6 feet of #24 magnet wire, for
 example.
<p>
 A surplus $25, 1 mW helium-neon laser head and power supply, or even a $1.99
 laser pointer may be more than adequate for your needs.
</ul>
<p>
If these are your only reasons for wanting to do this, you will rapidly tire
of the endeavor and the parts will end up in a box alongside that dusty old
partially ground telescope mirror you also never completed. :-(
<p>
If you want a working laser for a particular application, save your pennies and
buy one.  The cost of a used laser appropriate for what you have in mind may
not be as terrible as you may think.  The result of building a laser from
scratch isn't likely to be something you can use reliably day in and day out
without constant maintenance, repairs, and the occasional disaster.  (The one
exception to this might be the axial flow CO2 laser which if properly
constructed, is less finicky than the other types discussed in the following
chapters.)  A system that starts life on and under a workbench will also
probably never be packaged in a nice self-contained cabinet and may have to
coexist with the home washer-drier, family car, or kitchen table. :)  Anything
home-built is also going to have many potentially serious hazards associated
with it unless significant effort has been made to provide the necessary beam
blocks, electrical and thermal protection devices, and safety interlocks.

<h4><A NAME="concit2">Reasons TO Build a Laser from Scratch</A></h4>

However, there are many justifications for embarking on an adventure of this
type:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Educational experience.  I guarantee that you will learn a tremendous
 amount in the process - even if your baby never actually produces a beam.
 You will need to deal with a variety of disciplines (depending on the type
 of laser) possibly including: glass working, vacuum and gas supply systems,
 machining, design of high voltage power supplies, optical alignment,
 sensors, and more.  There is no better way to learn about these disciplines
 than to have to deal with them first-hand.  And, these efforts may stimulate
 interests in other areas as well.
<p>
<li>Challenge.  It probably goes without saying that the production of coherent
 light - even if for a short time - from a totally homemade laser represents
 a tremendous achievement with enormous satisfaction value.  Why do people
 climb mountains?  Building a laser is like climbing from the depths of the
 Pacific to the top of Everest and beyond.  Note: If you don't believe this
 then you will probably not have enough motivation to complete the project!
<p>
<li>Experimentation.  There are many things you can try with full access to
 both the inside and outside of the laser resonator that are impossible with a
 sealed HeNe or Ar/Kr ion tube.  Variations on the lasing medium including
 (for gas lasers) the types and pressures of the gas fill or (for dye
 lasers), the types and concentrations of dyes themselves; types of
 excitation (direct discharge, RF, light); alternative optics like curved and
 plane mirrors, prisms, lenses, and coatings,
</ul>
<p>
And, there is something to be said for being able to claim to have built
the only working laser from scratch on your block - or more likely, your
town, city, state, or country!

<h4><A NAME="conpwhb">Experiences of People Who Have Built Lasers From
 Scratch</A></h4>

Here are a few of the (mostly) success stories.  The fact that this list is
so short may be some testimony to the difficulties involved!  The first
is from one of the original authors of the SciAm Amateur Scientist column,
who recently contacted me via email:
<p>
(From: Syl Heumann (syl@syl.net).)
<p>
I am the author of the original SciAm article on the design of the pulsed
Argon laser.  I did another article for SciAm Amateur Scientist - a year or
two later.  It was how to make a hologram.
<p>
I got to know Red Stong, the Amateur Scientist editor quite well - visited
him at his home on Staten Island.
<p>
My first laser was a HeNe from the original SciAm article in about 1964 
or 1965,  It was raw AC powered and had a life of about 15 minutes!
Then I went to RF power and that was better, till I went to DC.  I had 
met some of the guys from Spectra-Physics and they were very helpful.  
Then I did a bunch of HeNe lasers - my best one did 16 mW.
<p>
They gave me the original notes on the first mercury vapor laser and I 
had one of those going in the next few days.
<p>
I guess my argon (also krypton) ion lasers were about 1966 or so.
<p>
When I did the argon laser, and looked at the light dispersed by a 
prism, there was an extra line in yellow.  I thought I had discovered a 
new transition - but after some research, it turned out that I had a 
leak - it was nitrogen!  But it was exciting.
<p>
I no longer have a high vacuum system, so don't mess with lasers any
more.  But please check out <A HREF="http://www.syl.net/">My Web Page</A>
for some other hobby interests.
<p>
(From: Mark Wilson (wilson_mark@htc.honeywell.com).)
<p>
I was born in a very small town in Idaho. I was fascinated by physics and
laser technology. When I saw the Scientific American article on building
your own Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser, I decided that I wanted to build it. The
Scientific American HeNe laser was extremely difficult to build and I could
not have done it without a lot of help. I got Spectra-Physics to donate a
set of laser mirrors to me, a glass shop in my home town to help me cut and
grind the Brewster window angles on the tube. The tube was made from lead
glass from a sign company, and I also used neon sign electrodes. The optical
rail was a 3 foot long piece of 2"x6" extruded aluminum that I got from a
glass company which used this material to make doors for commercial buildings.
<p>
I followed the directions in the Scientific American article to the letter.
I sealed the microscope slides to the glass tube using flexible colodian
that I got from a pharmacy. I filled the tube at a sign company which had
He, Ne, Ar and other gases on a glass manifold. I assembled the laser and
made the power supply using a mercury rectifier tube and a neon sign
transformer. I got the tube to lase for a brief time, but since it was not a
hard-sealed tube it quickly died probably due to helium diffusion. The tube
would light up but not lase for a while then that too stopped.
<p>
I then made a dye laser, again from a Scientific American article. This was
much easier, and the materials were much easier to obtain. I did not need
any wavelength selective mirrors, vacuum system, or high voltage supplies. I
ordered samples of a couple of laser dyes (Sodium Fluorescene, Rodium 6G
(possible spelled wrong)), and mixed up dye samples which were flowed
through a piece of quartz tubing. A flash lamp was located at one focus of
an elliptical reflector and the dye tube was at the other focus. The
reflector was a juice can that I polished up as per the article. The flash
lamp power supply was very simple which put several hundred volts across a
large capacitor, and then tripped the flash with a tickler coil. This laser
was easy to build, and actually worked for quite a while, but I couldn't set
anything on fire with it.
<p>
I then built a flowing gas CO2 laser again using glass and equipment from a
neon sign company. The Brewster windows were 2 near perfect salt crystals
that I got for a salt company in near by Salt Lake City. I had to keep the
windows inside plastic bags a moisture absorbing material when the laser was
not in use to keep the windows clear. I made my mirrors from round glass
blanks that I got from a local eye doctor. He ground me a set with a -1/8th
diopter (-8 meter focal length). I then drilled a small hole in one of the
glass blanks to allow the output beam to escape. I coated the mirrors with
gold using a sputtering machine that I built, again from a Scientific
American article. I assembled the tube and mirrors onto a extruded aluminum
base, and then connected it to a vacuum pump. This pump was two Fridgidare
compressors connected in series with  each other and a cold trap. Later I
replaced the pump with a 2 stage Cenco Hyvac pump that my friends at the
sign company donated to me. I made a gas manifold including a vacuum gauge,
to mix gases for the laser. I got a cylinder of CO2 (used in pop machines),
and also a small cylinder of Helium, bubbled the gases through water to add
water vapor and then flowed this mixture through the tube. I used a center
tapped neon transformer and a set of solid state rectifiers to make a DC
power supply to run the tube, and with an input of 150 watts of power, I
calculated that I got about 5 watts of IR power at 10.6 um. I could burn
holes in things so I was finally happy. 
<p>

<p>
I built my first C02 in 8th grade for our school's science fair with plans
from "Roy Davis Laboratories" (if anyone is old enough to remember those days).
It took about a year's worth of work and scrounging, but it worked so such a
project CAN be done.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).) 
<p>
I tried to build several lasers when I was a kid, dye worked, nitrogen worked,
argon failed. But, I found making Brewster angle windows nearly impossible.
The guy at the local refurb shop told me I went about it wrong, all I really
needed was a belt sander and some abrasive, the brass bladed sawing technique
in "Light and its Uses" doesn't work. I have also repumped a commercial laser
tube or two with mediocre results.
<p>
(From: Keith (Thallium204@aol.com).)
<p>
I have built a variety of lasers from scratch.
<p>
I have a tube blown by my friend, with microscope cover slips sealed on 
using Torr-seal epoxy I made in 1988. Its filled with an 80/20 mix of helium 
and neon, and is about three feet long. It uses several neon sign electrodes. 
Its large diameter (compared to 1 mm bore) gives it a TEM11 output.  With 
periodic gas fills, it still runs today, though I don't mess with it much.   
<p>
I have made very small argon lasers from scratch, but the cathodes are 
quite large, and do look just like early he-ne lasers.  The power supplies 
are very different, however.  I have an original "tube", not solid state, 
pulsed argon laser power supply from bell labs, 208 VAC, from the era of the
"Telephone pole theory of laser action": Hit a telephone pole with enough 
energy and it will lase. :)  Hundreds of amps per pulse, into a large diameter 
tube, before CW capillary tube type ion lasers.
<p>
I've also built an more unusual laser using the element thallium.
I'm sure you know that thallium is named after its strong green spectral
line.  It just happens that it has a very low melting/vapor point, and like
mercury needs no buffer gas to lase, it just needs a vacuum. It is not very
critical of vapor pressure as in the HeCd and HeSe.  The use of argon or neon
as a buffer does make it more efficient but is not absolutely needed.  The
mirrors from a dead green HeNe laser tube work fine (as long as their radius
of curvature is consistent with stability for the resonator).
<p>
(From: Thomas Rapp (post@pulslaser.com).)
<p>
My interest in lasers started very early when I was a young boy and read about
the invention of the ruby laser in a popular German magazine (Stern). But of
course, I who tried to build radios from old parts found in the city dump,
was not able to get either the materials nor the knowledge to build a laser.
However, years later, when I started to work as a technican at the Munich
University, I obtained an old HeNe Laser which didn't work anymore because
of gas cleanup. When I unsuccessfully  tried to reanimate the tube one older
scientist told me about the article in Scientific American about an
easy to build dye laser. Some weeks later, after a small fire hazard because
of blowing up the flashlamp and ignition of the methanol dye solution, my
first laser really worked. After that I began to read all about laser mostly 
in "Review of Scientific Instruments", "Applied Physics Letters", and "Journal
of Scientific Instruments".  After building a couple of nitrogen lasers, I
changed to copper, manganese, and lead vapour, and then I built a CW CO2
laser. After that my interest changed to other fields of physics, building
all kinds of vacuum devices, like a quadrapole mass spectrometers
and even a small scanning electron microscope, microwave devices like
a home-brew radio telescope.  And of course, I was working in the rapidly
growing computer area.  But all sorts of pulse power devices and their
application in lasers are still my favourites. Late in 2002 I got the job to
construct a nitrogen laser for a guy I got to know via eBay. After that I
decided to build lasers again, create my
<A HREF="http://www.pulslaser.de/">Pulslaser
Web Site</A> to share my knowledge and experiences with other laser
enthusiasts.

Hopefully more to follow. :)

<h4><A NAME="confcalc">Flavio's Comments on Amateur Laser Construction</A></h4>

(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
The reason for building a laser from scratch, is to learn how lasers work
through physical hands on construction.  Also, one major feature that
you have with home-built lasers, is the unlimited freedom of experimentation,
you can control many variables like; power (voltage and currents), gas,
optics, materials etc, which otherwise is very difficult or impossible with
commercial lasers.
<p>
Another rule that I have set when it comes to building lasers:  Build
the lasers that are more expensive, exotic, and least obtainable like:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Carbon Dioxide Laser.
 <li>Nitrogen Laser.
 <li>Copper Vapor and or other metal vapor lasers.
 <li>Solid state lasers - Ruby, Nd:YAG, frequency doubled YAGs.
 <li>Dye Laser (flashlamp and/or N2 laser pumped).
</ul>
<p>
In the list above, you may notice that I have NOT included typical lasers like
Helium Neon, and Argon Lasers, the reason being that HeNe lasers are now
too cheap to even consider building, and are all the too common. I have
not limited myself to not experimenting at all; I do have a HeNe laser
tube that I, one day would like to cut the vacuum nipple off, and connect
the tube to a vacuum system, and back-fill with HeNe, but the chance of
getting it to lase is quit small, due to the fact of the need of very
critical gas mixture and purity, and a very good vacuum system.
<p>
CW argon ion lasers, on the other hand, require huge amounts of current, and
the necessary materials to build the tube are not easy to work, toxic, or
both (e.g., beryllium oxide, tungsten).  Also, glass work is a
major component with the need of correctly angled Brewster windows.
Today, like the HeNe lasers, argon lasers can be obtained with ease, and
relatively cheaply. Argons, also require very good vacuum systems as well as
very pure and critical gas pressures.
<p>
So, as a summary, and as a rule of thumb please take the following in
mind:

<ol>
<li>If you are building a laser for experimentation, learning/educational
 purposes, then all the better, as your learning curve will be very steep.
<p>
<li>If you are intending to build a laser purely for a 'workhorse' application
 like wood or metal cutting, especially if for a commercial venture, it might
 be more economical and much easer to purchase a second-hand laser system from
 the surplus market.
<p>
<li>DO NOT expect great powerful beams of light outputting from your laser,
 and you will be shortly setting yourself up for a disappointing downfall. As
 mentioned, home-brewed lasers will require much experimenting around, you may
 be lucky enough to have the laser produce an output at first go, but also be
 prepared that you MAY NOT get an output at all.
<p>
<li>Use the 'KISS' Method - "Keep It Simple, Stupid".  In doing so, you can
 reduce the number of areas that can cause problems.  For example, the
 electrodes of a CO2 laser can just be copper pipe fittings (one at each end
 of the tube).  There is no need for neon sign electrodes which require
 additional assembly and possible glass work - and can possibly fail.
<p>
<li>Keep you laser tube within reasonable lengths.  At the very least for
 your first laser. Build your first laser, get this running and lasing,
 conduct experiments and chart results within a spreadsheet or something.
 voltage/current versus gas pressure/flow rate/mixture, etc.  Once you have
 succeeded in building your first working laser, then you can move on, and try
 building a bigger laser, at least you will not be disappointed if the laser
 does not work as you have already built a nice small working model.
</ol>

I hope that this will bring some reality into your projects, but please don't
interpret these comments as discouragement from building lasers.  I'm actually
trying to create more of a challenge for anyone who is or will be embarking on
this wonderful area of laser technology, yet to keep in mind that you may not
have a working product at first - a little like trying to build a tall
building, expecting it to stay up without the foundations.

Do you still remember the first Star Trek series? Ah, that was
something for a child's heart. Ha, there *was* a woman in a starship
(so don't tell me a girl can't fly to space silly boy you!!!), and
they had these "phasers" raying around during their
adventures. Nevertheless, I was a big girl (10) and knew, it was a TV
series. A kind of technical fairy tale.  The more I was surprised
when I found a popular science book at the local city library. There
were guys who made beams - really, not on TV. I didn't understand much
of the stuff described, but got that there were some sort of mirrors
and a ruby in it.  They called it L.A.S.E.R., and it was <i>real</i>.  For
the fact my grandpa could make for himself *everything* (he repaired
all the electric and mechanic stuff for our family, even hopeless
cases), I believed he (and also me) could make our own laser if we
just had one of these expensive rubys. I well knew a ruby was a
high-priced gem.  When I asked grandpa, he told me something about
precision and that it is not quite easy to reach this in the living
room of a hobbyist.  Ok, I could not buy a ruby from my spare
money. But from those days on I was convinced one day I *will* have my
own laser. One day.
<p>
Childhood dreams came to an end. No, to be honest, they only slept
until I was in the final High School classes. It was the beginning
80s, and being a frequent reader of the German issue of Scientific
American, one day I found the famous description of the mercury laser
in it.  Huh? A guy somewhere out there built his OWN laser?  The
fever came back again. When he could do it, I also can do it, I
decided.  However, I knew a lot more about physics than before, also
liked to spend time with the school's little HeNe laser (on rare
occasions). Got a basic knowledge of what is important for lasers to
become working.  A few telephone calls made me quite unhappy. I had
learned you can get all the stuff you need if you really want - and
can pay the prices. HIGH prices. Again there was the "ruby problem":
lasers are *expensive*.  "Silly, one cannot have one's own laser", a
fellow laughed about me, "that's only for laboratories." I better
not tell him about my desire.  So I thought: "One cannot? Let's see
about that."
<p>
Don't ask me today why I started to study mathematics.  We had a quite
famous Department of Quantum Optics on our university, perhaps I
should have gone to the laser business. But those days computers were
still more exciting than lasers to me, and that's it.  Now, being a
student, I had access to real scientific literature, and I learned a
lot about the theoretics of lasers (and, reading the business laser
magazines, also about technical realisations). I studied various
descriptions of laser types and decided to try about a flashlamp pumped
dye laser. This one at least needed no expensive ruby. :)  To make a
sad story short, I learned a lot about how to blast stroboscope tubes
using a voltage doubler and really BIG capacitors, and I guess the
carpet in my room at the student's community will still have these
nice pink rhodamine spots. :( I gave up on dyes.  But I still wanted a
laser, and some more telephone calls brought a fine small Siemens HeNe
tube to me (it was a new 1.5 mW LGR7621).  Shall I say I heard some
of the well known "brzzzz's" from self-wound transformers until I
looked for a used neon transformer? Still a descent of my grandpa I
was...  So I spent my time to build a casing for the transformer and a
rectifier out of a box of 1N4007's (never tell this an engineer
student. I did, the poor boy almost got a heart attack).  By the way,
the LGR7621 is quite robust. One day I caused a short which
*detonated* the anode resistor (another lesson about BIG
capacitors). After my eyes had recovered from the resulting supernova
inside the tube, I anxiously looked if there's still anything alive. A
visual inspection showed up a lot of very small cracks along the
inside of the bore.  Replaced the mortal remains of the blown resistor
by a fresh one, it still started and lased! I used it for years after
this accident without significant drop.  Brave little HeNe. :)
<p>
After some time, HeNe became boring to me. Using an internal mirror
tube is one task, to build a device like Scientific's mercury
completely on your own, quite another. So I started doing some
experiments in that direction for the next time.  I got a simple
vacuum pump and an unsealed neon tube and began to work with glow
discharges. To keep it short, I had to perform lots of experiments to
learn about vacuum, outgassing and purity of gases.  Over the years,
my little laboratory grew: a self-made voltage doubler for the neon
transformer, a self-made mercury vacuum gauge, a better pump, noble
gases in liter bottles, a hand-held spectroscope, longer discharge
tubes. To work, all this took years of learning by doing.  Then the
next strike came, of course again by Scientific American. It was the
copper vapor laser. How exciting...  For I knew very well I had no
experiences about laser optics until now - but the superradiant copper
lines would need none. In words, I could start immediately.  But
unlike the old days, I decided to study a bit about superradiant laser
before blindly begin to "hammer and saw". And by this I found out
about the still simpler N2 laser.  I decided to have one.  And in 91,
a self-made 10 cm test tube of acrylic with quartz windows lased! I
danced in my room, for after 10 years I finally got it!
<p>
For the fact the 10 cm tube lased quite weak I studied more about N2
laser design. The major problem was, I could reach only 10 kV with my
equipment thus having poor energy densities in the discharge. Longer
self-made tubes also lased weaker than expected (I tried several), even
if attaching a metal mirror to one end. I had to pinch the discharge
somewhat, but doing this in a tube made of acrylic would easily
overheat and smoke the walls.  Those days I already worked toward my
Ph.D. thesis, and the research center where I did it had the most
precious thing I ever saw in a library: the COMPLETE set of the Review of
Scientific Instruments!  Complete means complete: from issue #1 of
1929. And after some hours with it, I found the most useful paper
about N2 type gas lasers I know. It is about the "strip line" type
laser using a segmented discharge bore originally designed for the UV
lines of the hydrogen laser [1].  I adopted the design a bit to my
power supply (shorter strip-lines, shorter discharge segments) and
pinched the discharge even more by adding short pyrex capillaries
inside the segments. Believe me, it was a *lot* of work to drill holes
for 56 electrodes and fill in the pyrex tubes successively from the end
of the outer acrylic tube. But finally I had a 3 mm x 80 cm bore with
a nice high energy density. For its strange appearance, I baptised it
the "German Flute".  The first thing I noticed after the first tests
was, this baby would lase with every gas containing a bit nitrogen,
even dirty air.  :) Mirrors were good for nothing, and I easily got
all three UV lines on a fluorescent screen using a "water prism"
(triangle pot glued together from thin pyrex pieces and filled with
water, which absorbs UV much less than a massive pyrex prism).  Of
course I also tried other gases, and the green superradiant Ne line at
540.1 nm was strong in this tube, too. Over the time it became my
favourite.  And on few occasions, after long times of green Ne, it was
also possible to get the much weaker orange line at 614.3 nm at a
lower pressure. But normally it disappeared after some time from
outgassing impurities. The still weaker yellow line I never caught.
<p>
Impurities were what finally drove me tired. It was common for my
"German Flute" to be run with gas through flow. Otherwise lasing stayed
only for seconds. On one occasion I tried a bore cleaning via He
bombardment which took several hours. But after finish, what I call
the "dirt spectrum" (N2 band, H alpha line plus Hg lines -- mercury
from the vacuum gauge) reappeared in half an hour.  Whenever I liked to
start my laser, I had to spend days and hours in front just for basic
cleaning the vacuum devices. And, the cost for the needed constant
flow of Ne burned a hole in my pocket. Pure lab-grade neon isn't that
cheap.  And then, a few years later, I got a pen-sized red diode laser
which made roughly twice the output power of my home-built in the
green. It was depressing.
<p>
Sometimes in life one has crises and has to separate from several
things. So it was for me, and it was such a crisis which made me
giving away a lot of things - including all my lasers. The university
didn't take them (security reasons of course), but I found a physicist
collecting strange devices, and I hope my baby still has a home there
(even if it doesn't lase any more).  So, off I were.
<p>
Yes, until now. Some weeks ago I visited some friends, and I wondered
to see a yellow HeNe in their rooms. They told me to use it for
illumination of large naturally grown quartz crystals, for they like
the "golden shattered glow" in them doing so.  But they knew less to
nothing about lasers, and I talked about lasers for an hour or so. And
thought about I also would like illuminated crystals. But not red or yellow -
green and blue, perhaps from an argon ion laser it would have to be.
In the days of internet it is an easy task to feed "argon laser" to
google.de and see what happens. Of course it leads to Sam's Laser FAQ and
to lots of surplus advertisements.  I have the chance to get an
"all-included" ALC 60X (head, fan, cable, power supply, tube refilled)
for roughly $1,000.  Goddess, I have to scratch off those bucks somehow...
<p>
The beam has me back! :)

 discharge, Rev. Sci. Inst. 52(1981) p.1338.

<p>
I bet you're sorry you gave all that stuff away, even if you do know how
to do much of it better now.  A 60X is a nice laser but not quite the same
as something built from scratch that one can fondle and tweak! :)
<p>
(From: Diane.)
<p>
What did you do... Talking about fondling and tweaking my home-built laser...
Asking if I regret to give it away...??  Ah, sigh... :)  Finally I phoned the
guy I gave all the equipment and he told me I CAN HAVE IT BACK!  Now, I guess
I will have to do lots of maintenance work on my baby if it's home again
(stored at a garage for the past 3 years).
<p>
So I guess the beam really has me back! :)

<h4><A NAME="conbfsl">Building a Femtosecond Laser at Home?</A></h4>

Well, probably not.  But after you have constructed all the SciAm and other
"common" home-built lasers, it could be something to keep you occupied. :)
<p>
(From: Anonymous (localnet1@yahoo.com).)
<p>
Info on how to build a femtosecond laser? I have had a rather strong academic
interest in the field, if nothing else, on this subject for the last 10 years
or so. never in that  time have I seen a 'how to' build such a laser. if you
would like to see what others have done the academic journal 'Optics Lasers'
is your best bet, any major university library should subscribe to them, and
certain articles are available via their on line archive at the
<A HREF="http://www.osa.org/">Optical Society of America</A> Web site.
<p>
If on the other hand you are simply looking for background information on mode
locked lasers, nowadays most systems (or at least the easiest to build
systems) use a self starting mechanism and only really need:

<ol>
<li>Gain medium with sufficiently high bandwidth to support the pulses you are
 interested in -  Ti:Sapphire and dyes are the old standbys, but there are all
 sorts of different hosts that will produce sub-picosecond pulses.
<p>
<li>A system for achieving GVD compensation. For a long time, group velocity
 distribution has been accomplished by a pair of prisms tailor made with 'x'
 apex angle and 'y' refractive index.  However, in recent years it ahs been
 possible to use multi stack dielectric mirrors for GVD compensation.  If I'm
 not mistaken this was first done by Newport (or perhaps they had the first
 commercial mirrors, I don't remember which).

<h3><A NAME="concueg">Comments on a Universal Experimenter's Gas Laser</A></h3>

A question that comes up occasionally is: "How can I build a laser that I
can use to try out various gases and other parameters?".  Here are some
suggestions for a gas laser testbed optimized for visible and near-IR
operation.  Actually, these are more like random thoughts to get you started:

<ul>
<li>Build a reasonable length plasma tube with a medium size bore.
<p>
 <ul.
 <li>I would suggest something about 60 cm in length.  Too short and the gain
  of many gas mixtures will be inadequate; much longer and starting and
  sustaining a discharge will be a nightmare.
<p>
 <li>I would suggest a bore around 2 mm in diameter.  If the bore is too
  narrow, the starting voltage will be higher and in-place mirror alignment
  will be much more difficult; too wide and the gain is reduced (gain is
  inversely proportional to bore diameter) - and operation will be <i>very</i>
  multimode (though this may be interesting).
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Build your plasma tube with Brewster windows at both ends on stems that
 are at least 2 or 3 inches long to keep them away from the discharge.  For
 a wide wavelength range, putting these on ball and socket or flexible mounts
 may be desirable to permit their angle to be varied slightly.
<p>
<li>Provide electrodes suitable for your expected types of lasers.  The
 positive (anode) electrode can usually just be a wire or sleeve (cooling and
 sputtering aren't significant).  However, the negative electrode should be
 made of a suitable material (e.g., aluminum, heated tungsten, etc.) for
 the laser operation - pulsed or CW, low or high current, etc.  Place the
 cathode(s) in a side-arm so prevent sputtered material from getting to the
 Brewster windows.
<p>
<li>Build universal mirror mounts that can accept a variety of mirrors - you
 won't always be able to find the same size or thickness.  I would suggest
 something like the mirror cell arrangement described in the section:
 <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpmlm">Mounting Laser Mirrors</A>.
<p>
<li>Install a Helium-Neon (HeNe) alignment laser as a permanent part of your
 testbed.  Mirror alignment is one of those things you will be doing
 constantly.  It will be desirable to be able to do initial set up and
 checking without having to assemble the alignment jig every time!
<p>
<li>Start with broadband HR mirrors having as high a reflectivity as you can
 get or afford over the wavelength range of interest.  The HRs used in HeNe
 lasers may be much better than 99.9 percent.  (If an 'other color' home-built
 HeNe laser is in your plans, particularly one that does green, even the OC
 reflectivity will have to approach these values!)  The higher the
 reflectivity, the lower your lasing threshold.  The radius of curvature (r)
 should be at least equal to the distance between the mirrors (L) but probably
 not more than 2*L since if the focal lengths (f = r/2) are too long,
 alignment becomes more difficult.
<p>
 As noted below, some HRs are not polished on their rear surface.  It may be
 possible to attach an optical flat (e.g., piece of a good quality microscope
 slide) with optical cement or Epoxy to reduce scattering and reflections from
 that surface but this won't be ideal.
<p>
<li>For initial experiments, take the output beam off the Brewster reflections
 or from the leakage through the (HR) mirrors.  Once you know which line(s)
 you want, a specific OC mirror spectral curve and reflectivity can be
 selected.
</ul>

Reading through the chapters on each of the types of home-built lasers that
follow should provide some of the details.  Start with the chapter:
<A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgtoc">Home-Built Pulsed Multiple Gas (PMG) Laser</A>
which deals with an approach along these lines.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
Also, take note that most HR mirrors are a lot better than 'just' 99%
reflectivity, at least when you are talking about intracavity mirrors. Also
a lot of commercially available HR mirrors are not designed for laser use -
they only have their back surface fine ground, not polished.  This means you
can't get a HeNe laser beam through them for alignment purposes (particularly
optics from Thor Labs and CVI). Another reason why generic broadband lasers
may not be suitable, is that if you have any plans on making a high power
pulsed laser (e.g., ruby or YAG), most off the shelf optics can not cope with
the power/energy levels you would be exposing it to, and will quickly fail.
Just a few things to watch out for!

<h3><A NAME="conwnss">What About a Home-Built Solid State Laser?</A></h3>

Note that there is currently no mention here (or as far as I know, in the
Amateur Scientist articles of Scientific American) of ruby, YAG, vanadate,
and other solid state lasers.  However, there is a chapter:
<A HREF="lasercps.htm">Home-Built Pulsed Solid State (PSS) Laser</A>
which is under construction and another one:
<A HREF="lasercds.htm">Home-Built Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) Laser</A>
which is already fairly well along.
<p>
Since there is no realistic possibility of actually growing, shaping, grinding,
and polishing a raw laser crystal in your basement, there are, never were,
and never will likely be any truly built-from-scratch SS lasers.  You will have
to buy the crystals ready-made.  And, since there is less standardization on
SS laser components than for many other types of lasers, it isn't even possible
to suggest many sources for parts with particular specifications unless you are
willing to pay new (and very high) prices.  That's the bad news.  The good
news is that SS lasers are much easier to get working even with a less than
optimal match between the lasing medium, pump source, and mirrors, than many
other types of lasers.  While the gain of a HeNe laser may be 10 percent per
meter, the gain of a solid state laser rod with flashlamp pumping may be 10
percent per <i>cm</i>!  (And when diode pumped, the gain is much higher still.)
<p>
Pulsed (flashlamp pumped) SS lasers have been popular projects since the
invention of the laser and with reasonable care, a successful outcome is
likely.  They are by far, the easiest lasers to construct capable of blasting
holes in things. :)  There are many surplus components and partial or complete
systems available at reasonable cost.  As companies switch over to Diode Pumped
Solid State (DPSS) lasers from lamp pumped types, more and more pulsed SS laser
components and systems are showing up on the surplus market.
<p>
Building a DPSS laser, especially one with frequency doubling to produce green
(532 nm) output is a more complex - likely much more expensive - undertaking,
but one that can be accomplished successfully.  And, because DPSS lasers are
becoming more popular, components for these are coming down in price, at least
somewhat.  So, there is hope. :)

<h3><A NAME="ioihbxr">Home-Built X-Ray Laser?</A></h3>

The following is from a recent paper: "Generation of millijoule-level
soft-x-ray laser pulses at a 4-Hz repetition rate in a highly saturated
tabletop capillary discharge amplifier", C. D. Macchietto, B. R. Renware,
and J. J. Rocca, Optics Letters, vol. 24, no. 16, pp, 1115-1117, August, 1999.
<p>
(Portions from: Bob.)
<p>
There are a good number of people who have built or are currently building
their own lasers. from simple systems, to the extravagant. I was going through
some current journals today, as things were slow here, and I saw something that
caught my eye, making me instantly think of this group: A table top soft X-ray
laser.
<p>
Basically, this system was quite simple.  It had a 0.32 mm ID aluminum oxide
capillary evacuated to roughly half a Torr filled with argon gas, pre-ionize
by a discharge.  It was pulsed with a high current pulse (approximately 26
kiloamps!) with a fast (40 ns) rise time using a water capacitor and series
spark gap switch.  The water served as both the dielectric of the capacitor
and as cooling for the capillary.  The capacitor was charged by a 4 stage
Marx generator located in a separate box.  The laser itself occupied an area
of only about .4 x 1 m (16 x 40 inches).  Since the laser operates in a highly
saturated regime, no cavity optics are required.  The output beam profile had
a ring shape (due to plasma density gradients in the plasma column) with a
half-angle divergence of about 4.6 mR.  The output energy averaged about
.88 mJ at 4 Hertz.
<p>
I (Bob) kinda like the idea of having an X-ray laser in the corner of my lab.
So I'm gonna build one, though maybe others might like to as well.  For your
information, when the NOVA laser was used to pump a soft X-ray laser, they
got out 8 mJ pulsed, with a repetition rate of about 1 pulse per 30 minutes
(!!) or so.  It would be kinda cool to have a 1 mJ X-ray laser, especially if
it could operate at 4 or 5 pps.  And, with higher average power than the NOVA
laser pumped X-ray laser!!!!!  (Although I must admit that one generated
shorter wavelength X-rays: 15 nm instead of 47 nm.  Well, you can't have
everything.)

<li><A HREF="http://www.amazing1.com/">Information Unlimited</A> has what are
 supposedly complete plans argon ion, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, copper vapor,
 and tunable dye lasers.  (In the case of the CO2 laser, they have parts, kits,
 and completely assembled versions as well - supposedly.)  I doubt that it is
 coincidental that these are also most of the types of lasers covered in the
 Amateur Scientist columns of Scientific American!  I do not know whether if
 the plans are of any value beyond those or whether they are indeed just poor
 reproductions or transcriptions.  I also have no idea of whether what they
 provide is credible for the price or whether it is likely to result in a
 successfully completed project.  Also see the section:

 Unlimited.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.electronickits.com/">Carl's Electronics</A> has plans
 for a 40 W CO2 laser, ruby laser, and possibly others.  I have no idea of the
 integrity of this outfit or the quality of what they offer.  They kind of
 appear to be in the same league as Information Unlimited, above.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.mwklasers.com/">MWK Laser Products</A> also has plans
 for most of the types of lasers included in "Light and its Uses".  As with
 the plans, above, I do not know if these are derived from there or elsewhere
 or whether there is any benefit to buying these as opposed to digging up the
 info in "Light and its Uses" in conjunction with this document!  (Lasershop
 is a spinoff of MWK so I expect the plans to be similar.)

<h3><A NAME="concit6">Scrounger of the Month Award</A></h3>

Here is a success story on obtaining help in glasswork, AND inexpensive neon
sign transformers and vacuum pumps from the same source - you guessed it - a
neon sign shop!  It seems that many neon sign types are also interested in
lasers (or at least fantasize about building one) and are therefore sympathetic
to the needs of amateur laser constructors!  For more info, see the section:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#contdns">Tips for Dealing with a Neon Sign Shop</A>.
<p>
(From: Tom Miller (tmiller@umaryland.edu).)
<p>
Ok, today was GOOD!  I visited a local sign shop, one of the larger ones, and
got to talk to the owner.  He was the one who initially nixed selling any
transformers to the general public.  After a brief discussion explaining what
I wanted to do, he took me on a tour of the whole facility.  It seems he may
be interested in constructing a laser also.  He was checking prices for CO2
lasers for use in cutting plastic sign material and for a 50 watt unit, was
seeing prices in the $50,000 range.  Now granted, this included the mechanical
positioning equipment, but still, he thought it to be too high.
<p>
Anyway, I left him a copy of Sam's Laser FAQ and my business card.  He wants
me to give him a drawing of the glasswork and he will put it all together.
Says it will take less than an hour, so I told him I would pay for his time.
He suggested that I use a "tubated" electrode on each end and connect the
vacuum pump to one end and the gas supply to the other.  This way, the flowing
gas will cool the electrodes.  
<p>
We got around to talking transformers and I ask what a 15 kV, 30 mA unit would
cost.  He asks if I could use a 15 kV, 60 mA transformer if it was used.  I
was completely surprised when he said it would only cost $10. This transformer
was sitting on his glasswork bench and he was using it to test tubes.  The guy
showed me a pile of neon sign transformers under a very large workbench. Must
have been 20 to 30 there.  Also, the owner told me he had MANY old vacuum pumps
just sitting around.  I saw at least 5 of them.
<p>
Next, he asked what I would mount the laser on.  I said I would like to use an
aluminum I-beam about 3 to 4 inches wide and about 4 feet long.  He took me to
a different area of the shop and found a scrap piece of the stuff.  I figured
that I would stop using all of his time, and told him I would go and make a
drawing for the tube and get it to him sometime in the next few weeks.
<p>
So, anyone having problems, just load up with Sam's Laser FAQ, go find a large
old neon shop and talk to the guys who actually do the work.  You will be
surprised how much interest they will have in a good powerful laser.
<p>
So today was a good one. :)

<h2>Setting up a Home Laser Lab</h2>
<h3><A NAME="consaf">Safety Issues in a Lab for Home-Built Lasers</A></h3>

There are a variety of issues that are important for any sort of home lab
or workshop but the following, in particular, apply directly to lasers and
laser construction:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Laser safety.  In some ways, a home-built laser is MORE dangerous in terms
 of risk to vision (at least) compared to a commercial one.  One reason is
 that the output power and behavior is less predictable - and there are no
 manufacturer's specifications for MAXIMUM output.  Therefore, one must err
 on the side of caution - assume that they are at the upper end of any
 possible range of power outputs.  For all except the CO2 laser, these will
 at least be well into the Class IIIb range.  The CO2 WILL be Class IV!  This
 doesn't mean you will get an eye-killer beam from your laser - just that you
 cannot safely assume you WON'T!
<p>
 See the chapter: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser Safety</A> for more
 information.
<p>
<li>High voltage.  The power supplies for these lasers almost all involve high
 voltage at significant current and/or with sizable high voltage filter or
 energy storage capacitors.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>The neon sign/luminous tube transformers often used for excitation of gas
  lasers come in various sizes but are all potentially lethal.  The larger
  ones, even more so.
<p>
 <li>Any time you are storing energy in multi-kV storage capacitors, you are
  talking about seriously deadly equipment.
<p>
 <li>Even little high voltage inverters running off some AA batteries can
  generate deadly output - especially where a capacitor is involved.
</ul>
<p>
 Read and understand the information in the document: "Safety Guidelines for
 High Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment" BEFORE constructing and powering
 any of these systems.
<p>
<li>Radio frequency sources including microwaves.  It is possible to excite
 some of the gas lasers using a radio transmitter or magnetron tube from a
 microwaves oven.  These approaches, while tempting, introduce an entire
 additional set of safety issues - both electrical and with respect to
 exposure to non-ionizing radiation.  I would recommend AGAINST attempting
 to power your laser in this manner - at least not unless you are have had
 extensive experience with high power RF equipment and until you have dealt
 with a home-built laser powered by direct electrical excitation.  For some
 additional comments and safety issues, see the section:
 <A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2cc29">RF or Microwave Power Supply for CO2
 Laser?</A>.
<p>
<li>X-rays.  This is one area that should NOT be a significant worry despite
 the use of fairly high voltages and tubes with some sort of a vacuum for
 many of these lasers - unless you are building a Free Electron or X-ray laser
 in your basement. :-)  To generate energetic X-rays requires particles to be
 accelerated to a high velocity and to strike a heavy metal target.  While up
 to 25 kV (peak) may be present for some of these home-built lasers, at the
 gas pressures at which they operate (and the vacuums achievable without true
 high vacuum equipment), the mean-free-path is too short for particles (e.g.,
 electrons) to reach a high enough velocity to for serious levels of X-ray
 production.  Any that are generated will be 'soft' X-rays that are blocked by
 the tube walls.  In the early days of X-ray development, gas tubes were used
 because they either didn't know any better or equipment capable of achieving
 a decent vacuum was not readily available.  Exposure times were 10s of
 minutes or more at close range even when designed for X-ray production.
<p>
 However, should you actually be powering a tube (for whatever reason) pumped
 down to perhaps 10<sup>-6</sup> Torr or better with a heated cathode (since
 you can then easily get significant current even in a perfect vacuum - not
 really practical or likely by accident with a cold cathode) attached to a HV
 power supply, X-rays can become a real safety issue!   There is no actual
 threshold where X-ray energy starts to become a hazard but below about 15 kV,
 X-rays won't penetrate the glass of the tube.  X-ray machines for mammography
 which run at *only* 30 to 50 kV have tubes with beryllium windows to allow
 the radiation to pass through the tube walls.  However, taking precautions
 when using voltages higher than 15 kV with high vacuum systems would be
 prudent.
<p>
 Commercial X-ray machines are based on ultra-high vacuum tubes consisting of
 a heated tungsten filament (cathode) and a target (anode) made from tungsten,
 tungsten-rhodium or some other exotic material enclosed in a glass or ceramic
 envelope.  The typical dental X-ray unit (about the smallest common type of
 X-ray system for patient imaging) may use 10 mA and 70 kV.  At the other end
 of a major X-ray equipment manufacturer's product line would be the X-ray
 generator for a high performance spiral CT scanner which may go up to 400 mA
 at 130 kV or more. :-).  (If you are really curious, the way they get rid of
 the approximately 50 kW of waste heat in the latter case (most of which is
 generated at the anode and concentrated at a spot a mm or so across) is to
 make the anode in the form of a massive disk spun at high speed via an
 induction motor magnetically coupled through the tube envelope with the tube
 bathed in oil which is circulated through a large heat exchanger.  Even all
 this isn't really adequate to keep up with heat production - these things can
 only run for a couple minutes at a time at full power before they need to be
 powered down to allow the tube to cool.  And you thought it was difficult to
 cool an ion laser!)
<p>
 Having said all that, it never hurts to err on the side of caution.  Once you
 start powering your laser, get one of those X-ray films you love so much from
 your friendly dentist and cover the front (smooth side - the back has a lead
 foil shield inside) of it with a metal mask (e.g., a wire formed into your
 initials) so you will know if it actually gets exposed.  Place it front-side
 facing and near your laser tube (but not so close that there may be arcing
 to it) and let it cook for a few minutes with power on.  Have the film
 developed and inspect it carefully.  If you see ANY shadow of the mask,
 there has been some X-ray exposure and further testing and possible shielding
 would be adviced.  If there is nothing visible, try again with an exposure
 time of an hour.  Of course, if the film is totally blackened, you have
 serious problems (or have somehow built an X-ray laser).  For a more
 quantitative test, get a radiation film badge with specific instructions on
 its use, and have it processed and evaluated.
<p>
 (From: Terry Greene (xray@cstel.net).)
<p>
 <blockquote>
 "There is no practical problem with X-rays at the typical voltage used in
  most gas type lasers.  All mammography tubes use special beryllium windows
  for the radiation output because X-rays at those low energies (20 to 32 kVP)
  won't penetrate the glass envelope of a standard tube. I've tried it.  A
  glass envelope (standard) X-ray tube won't produce any exposure at all at
  15 kVP according to my test equipment. (Keithly ion chamber).  Even with
  complete evacuation, I seriously doubt you could find measurable X-ray
  output from a glass bore laser."
 </blockquote>
<p>
<li>Water/liquids.  The CO2 laser will require water cooling.  You may want to
 add water cooling to others like the Ar/Kr laser to boost output power.  The
 dye laser involves the use of liquids - some of them quite nasty.  All use
 high voltage AC line connected power supplies.  This makes these doubly
 dangerous.  Make sure all precautions are taken including proper wiring and
 grounding of all equipment AND plumbing!  Even though the HV discharge is
 supposed to be between special electrodes, it can jump to nearby metal
 fittings - and you!
<p>
<li>Vacuum systems.  One of the major dangers is from implosion of improperly
 designed or selected vacuum vessels.  See the chapter:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvatoc">Vacuum Technology for Home-Built Gas
 Lasers</A> for specific guidelines on this and other vacuum system
 hazards.
<p>
<li>Toxic/corrosive chemicals.  Some of the materials used for glass cleaning,
 electrode coatings, heavy metals (for the helium-mercury and other similar
 lasers), and organic dyes (for dye lasers) are extremely toxic, corrosive,
 or both.  Make sure you understand the chemical safety issues.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Poisonous chemicals can get picked up on cleaning materials, clothing,
  surfaces of lab glassware, tabletops, storage cabinets, the bottom of
  your shoes, etc.
<p>
 <li>The fumes from these chemicals are likely to be toxic and irritating as
  well.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Flammable or suffocating gases.  While the actual quantities of gases
 used in most of these lasers is infinitesimal (since they operate at a very
 small fraction of atmospheric pressure), some gas will escape and leaks can
 occur.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>These are all colorless and most are odorless so there will be no visible
  signs of a leak or buildup of fumes.
<p>
 <li>Proper ventilation must be provided
<p>
 <li>Gases that are heavier than air in particular can hang around resulting
  in a layer that you cannot breath or one that is flammable.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Glass working, annealing, and outgassing flames.  Needless to say, any time
 that open flames are used, precautions must be taken to assure that no
 flammable materials are in the vicinity.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Obviously, this includes the chemicals and gases mentioned above.
<p>
 <li>Shavings from wood and plastic gutting, filing, grinding, and sanding are
  extremely flammable and should be completely cleaned up and removed before
  lighting the propane or oxy-hydrogen glass working torch!
<p>
 <li>Have a fire extinguisher of the proper type - rated for chemical AND
  electrical fires - in a location that is accessible outside the range of
  any possible fire.  Make sure you cannot be trapped by a fire.  Two fire
  extinguishers and two means of egress at opposite ends of the lab are
  even better.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
There didn't appear to be a critical mass of lawyers present at the time most
of the articles in "Light and its Uses" were written.  Therefore, they tend
not to deal with the safety issues as emphatically as might be desired.  Most
of these projects have aspects (most often the high voltage power supplies)
that are potentially dangerous or lethal.  Safety must be at the top of your
list of priorities when undertaking such an endeavor!

<h3><A NAME="concll1">Work Area - Setting up a Laser Lab</A></h3>

Since any of these lasers represents a long term comittment, it is essential
that an area be set aside for your laser lab.  Therefore, the kitchen or
dining room table is NOT an appropriate place to be constructing a laser.
It is possible to do without the sort of setup depicted in the section:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#concll2">Possible Laser Lab Layout</A> but there are
some basic requirements for a safe, functional, and convenient space:
<p>
<ul>
<li>An area that is as dust free as possible is absolutely essential.  Dirt,
 dust, condensed tobacco smoke or cooking grease, or other contamination of
 optical surfaces is a major cause of problems in getting a laser to work
 and/or result in reduced output power or erratic operation.
<p>
 Forget about smoking around precision optics.  Aside from slowly killing
 yourself, a miniscule amount of tobacco smoke residue will play havoc with
 mirrors and lenses - especially inside the laser resonator.  You will be
 wasting your time or worse.  Just because you saw a demo where someone
 blew smoke in the path of a laser beam to make it visible is no excuse as
 that was just a one-time demo.  There are special means of generating
 smoke for this purpose which are non-toxic and do not condense on optical
 surfaces should a real need arise.
<p>
<li>You must be able to leave it undisturbed probably for weeks or MONTHS on
 end.  Therefore, a spare room is best.  You definitely don't want to share
 your lab with a woodworking or gardening operation.  Or, your kid brother
 who likes to wreck EVERYTHING! :-)
<p>
<li>There must be access to enough electricity.  At least three dedicated
 circuits with local cutoff switches/circuit breakers will be desirable
 just for the laser - vacuum pump(s), power supply, cooler, etc.  In the
 USA, this probably means 115 VAC, 20 A each though some equipment may
 run on 230 VAC.  Depending on the lasers you'll be building, much more may
 be needed.  Start by estimating the maximum consumption of everything you
 expect to be running at the same time - and then double it!  And, this
 doesn't even include electrical circuits for test equipment, room lighting,
 and utility outlets.  These should be separate should you decide to blow a
 fuse or pop a circuit breaker!  Install power strips all along the walls
 behind your work surfaces.
<p>
<li>There probably needs to be running water and a drain.  Where chemicals are
 involved, the drain should be direct to a sewer, not a sump - assuming you
 can safely put them down at all.
<p>
<li>There must be adequate ventilation.  However, there should be NO way for a
 laser beam to escape to the outside world!  This means there can be no
 open or uncovered windows!  And, if your laser accidentally drills a hole
 through your stone and stucco exterial wall, patch it up as quickly as
 possible. :-)
<p>
<li>Minimization of fire and water damage risk.  This is mostly common sense
 meaning a room with a concrete or vinyl floor and NO curtains or drapes.
 A room in a dry basement is probably best if it can be made reasonably
 dust-free.
<p>
<li>It must be large enough to provide space for you, the laser itself AND
 for any additional length required by alignment or other optical add-ons
 to the laser.  Also, don't forget creature conforts for your guests like
 a sleep sofa (for when you are performing critical mirror alignment),
 stereo, big screen TV - OK, just kidding. ;-)
<p>
<li>Storage.  There can never be too much.  You need to be able to handle all
 sorts of components, electronic and optical assemblies, partially or fully
 completed lasers or other apparatus, chemicals, and other supplies.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Metal double door supply cabinets are ideal for larger items and for
  holding the multi-drawer parts cabinets you will also need (see below).
<p>
  These are typically 18" to 24" deep by 36" wide and 60" to 78" tall with
  multiple adjustable shelves.  The larger the better if you have the
  space.  I have gotten mine from garage and tag sales in good condition
  for between $10 and $40 (they retail for over $200).
<p>
  Of course, other kinds of cabinets are fine as well.  However, anything
  you chose should have doors to minimize dust on optical and electronic
  components and assemblies.
<p>
 <li>Small cabinets with 24 to 50 plastic drawers are most convenient for
  electronic, optical, hardware and mechanical parts.  One with 50 drawers
  can typically be purchased for $10 to $15.  I prefer where all the
  drawers are the same size - those with multiple size drawers seem just
  plain silly. :-)
<p>
 <li>File cabinets with half-height (index card) drawers and blue print
  cabinets are excellent for tools and parts as well.  These are
  unbelievably expensive if purchased new but sometimes turn up at estate
  sales and the like for a song (because most people cannot think of a
  good use for them!).
<p>
 <li>The wall space above your optical or electronics benches can also be
  utilized by adding some shelves or even those recycled kitchen cabinets
  (which are even better since they have doors!).
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="concll2">Possible Laser Lab Layout</A></h3>

I wish I had this!  Note: Two means of exit and two fire extinguishers!
<p>
Also note the chair - most important - and the bench for your guest (though
probably should be s eleep-sofa so they can snooze while you spend the
afternoon adjusting your gas mixture or performing mirror alignment. :-)

<h3><A NAME="concll3">Sources of Special Parts and Supplies</A></h3>

This section deals mostly with the items to equip your lab, small parts,
chemicals, and so forth.  Also see the sections on vacuum equipment, optics,
and power supply components, in this and the chapter that follows, as well as
the chapter <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A>.
And note that many of these items appear regularly on eBay and other auction
sites as well as high-tech flea markets.  Apparently, at least one person is
even selling small quantities of chemicals to the public on eBay!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Lab and vacuum equipment - Scientific supply companies, surplus outfits,
 neon sign shops (their cast-offs), eBay.
<p>
<li>Glassware including glass tubing - Scientific supply companies (expensive
 but high quality and large variety), neon sign shops (probably tubing only).
 Some large hobby shops may have some of this as well but the quality may be
 poor (and hobby shops seems to be going the way of the dinosaur!).
<p>
 For borosilicate (Pyrex) tubing in particular any of the large scientific
 supply companies are probably the best sources.  Tubing comes in 4 foot
 lengths and the typical price is $10 to $15 per pound.  They will also carry
 fused silica (Vycor) and fused quartz tubing (though neither of these really
 should be needed for any of the home-built lasers unless you are doing
 something like attempting to push the envelope on the argon ion laser power
 output.)

 selected items, they have what they call a "shelf pack" and that seems to be
 the best bang for the buck for standard wall Pyrex tubing ($25 to $50 for
 2 to 50 lengths (approximately 4 foot) depending on diameter.  This isn't
 bad if especially if you can find a few buddies to share expenses.
 Unfortunately, they don't have this option for medium or thick wall tubing
 which is what may be needed for some of the home-built lasers.  However,
 although small diameter tubing is sold by the 100, 4 foot pieces (typically
 $200 to $400, ouch), larger diameter tubing may be available by the pound -
 which is probably even better than the shelf pack.  So, check out their
 on-line catalog.  Note: Minimum order is $75."

 However, Tim Goldstein of the Laser Growing group (see the section:
 <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concit5">General Resources for Amateur Laser
 Construction</A>) has found that
 <A HREF="http://www.glasscraftinc.com/">Glasscraft, Inc.</A> (nothing much at
 their Web site yet) will sell in small quantities (even a single piece of
 tubing) to individuals.  They accept major credit cards and there is no
 minimum order (though a $5 handling fee will added for orders under $50).
<p>
<li>Gases -  Chemical supply companies, Gas supply companies (e.g., AirCo),
 Welders and welding supply companies, neon sign shops and supply companies.
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concll4">More on Obtaining Gases</A>.
<p>
<li>Chemicals - Chemical supply companies, high school/college teaching or
 research labs, your local grocery, pharmacy, hardware store, home-center,
 and supermarket!  Not all chemicals are exotic and hard to find!  And,
 as noted above, try eBay as well!
<p>
<li>Electrodes - Neon sign shops and supply companies or fabricate your own
 from thin sheet aluminum (flashing), tubes, or foil.  Commercial neon sign
 electrodes only cost $2 or so.
<p>
<li>Optics - New, surplus, salvage (e.g., broken HeNe laser tube to obtain
 dicroic mirrors).  Check out the various suppliers listed in the chapter:
 <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A>.  Note: A basic
 requirement for going through life should be at least one trip to to the
 Edmund Scientific's outlet store!  Also see the section:
 <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao6">Sources for Reasonably Priced Optics, Mounts,
 and Other Related Components</A>.
<p>
<li>Mirror alignment jig.  It is a simple matter to make your own.  For these
 relatively wide bore lasers, this can be done using simple materials (like
 cards with holes punched in them, flashlight bulbs, and microscope slides.
 Or, if you have an HeNe or collimated diode or other working laser, using
 that for a light source.  There are at least two alternative basic parts
 type designs in "Light and its Uses" and laser based designs in the
 chapters: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoc">Helium-Neon Lasers</A> and
 <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>.
<p>
<li>Structural materials - scrap/salvage/junk yards, lumber yards,
 home-centers, machine/metal shops.  Sometimes common household items are
 overlooked - be creative.
<p>
 Places that deal with plastics and metal (e.g., sign shops, metal
 fabricators, machine shops, etc.) usually have scrap bins with all the
 stuff that is too small or irregularly shaped to put back into inventory.
 They will probably sell pieces from there very cheaply (maybe by the pound)
 or just let you take what you want free of charge.  With just a little
 effort, you may be able to obtain all the little structural bits and pieces
 needed to construct your laser (except probably the main support beam - for
 that you will likely have to pay something) as well as the raw materials for
 the mirror mounts at little or no cost.
</ul>
<p>
Develop a relationship with a teacher/instructor/professor/researcher at a
high school/technical school/college/university/industrial lab.  Some people
will be more than eager to help and mentor you - even to the extent of loaning
equipment or donating small quantities of chemicals, electronic components,
hard to find optics, etc., to your cause.  Use of their lab may even be
possible.  And, universities sometimes toss out the most amazing things - like
complete vacuum systems - when a grant runs out and they need the space!
There are various programs as well to encourage students to go into science
and technology fields.  Who knows, they may even pay you to do this!
<p>
Call up laser and optics manufacturers.  Sure, many won't give you the time of
day unless they think you will be ordering $1,000,000 worth of equipment.
But, all you need is one to say yes!  There are always such things as cosmetic
rejects or seconds - that are useless to them because they cannot sell the
parts - but fine for your needs.  The trick is to hold their attention long
enough - or be such a (polite) pain in the neck that the easy way out is for
the company to provide what you want!  I have heard of people obtaining all
sorts of material, parts, equipment - some of it worth quote a lot of money -
in this manner.
<p>
In summary - possible places to find useful stuff:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Household items.
<li>Scientific equipment/chemical/industrial supply and surplus houses.
<li>High school/college/university labs
<li>Industry, particularly laser, optics, and scientifically oriented
 companies.
<li>Metal, wood, and plastic fabricators, neon sign shops.
<li>Garage sales, flea markets, hamfests, thrift stores, etc.
<li>Hardware stores, home centers, pharmacies, variety stores, supermarkets.
</ul>

 the yellow sodium flare light so you can see what the glass is doing.  I'd
 recommend the glasses for beginning glass blowers, it's like X-ray vision

For cathode material, just ask for what the machinists call "gummy" aluminum,
the really hard to work soft stuff that gums up tooling, and you've got it.
Not 905 or  2025, maybe 6061, but 6061 has a lot of weird stuff in it like
silicon monoxide.  One guy I watched once sputtered the cathode in a oxygen
discharge, then cleaned it with hydrogen in a soft glow. Nickel is the
metal of choice for anode pins and wiring inside the tube, but its going to
take some work to spot weld it to the kovar or dumet lead throughs, you
need to find or make  a "thermocouple" welder designed for cap discharge
welding of small wires.     
<p>
You can get pure aluminum, nickel wire, tungsten wire, titanium sheet, etc.
from Small Parts, Inc. (Miami Lakes, Florida, 1-800-220-4242). They sell it
chopped up in small quantities at decent prices, with no minimum order.  They
specialize in what they call "Engineering Findings", in other words, small
quantities of all the goofy parts you need to make industrial prototypes,
and they tolerate us hobbyists.  Reading the Small Parts catalog will keep
you spellbound for a few hours, it's worth the call. 
<p>
The other source for cathode type aluminum and nickel tubing/wire is MDC, Inc,
also in Florida.  They also sell high vacuum parts such as flanges and seals
and have the tubing and the low temp. brazing materials you need to make tubes.
They don't stock the aluminum as cathode material, but it's the right type.
Surprisingly the stuff the hobby shops sell in the K&S displays is pure
aluminum, otherwise they couldn't extrude it that cheaply.  Both Florida
companies have Web sites but I (Steve) don't recall what they are.

<p>
The following comments deal with a variety of gases required for laser
construction.
<p>
(From: Cass (cassegrainian@galaxycorp.com).)
<p>
The CO2 laser-mix gas is typically sold in "H" bottles for $85.00 per fill.
The company that I checked with will allow one to specify their own blend of
CO2, He, N2.  Your local welding/medical supply company may vary.  Try to find
the largest gas company in your area as many of the smaller ones simply use
them to fill your bottle(s) and tack on an additional charge.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I went to purchase a tank of nitrogen today. I own the tank, so a fill was
$10.80 + tax for a size "P" tank (It seems no two gas places use the same
letters) because I own the tank.  I needed N2 to test a nitrogen laser for a
customer.  As I was walking out the door it dawned on me to ask what the price
for a CO2 mix would be. The fellow couldn't give me the mix percentages, but
said that for my tank, the fill of UltraMix by AGA would be $16.85.  My tank
is about 14" tall by 5.5" in diameter cost $89.00 when I bought it last
summer.  When I need a fill, they just swap tanks.  So I guess I'm getting a
tank of mix next week when I'm done with the N2.
<p>
I actually think this is good news because when I talked to the rep on
the phone and a leased tank of gas in the same size was quoted at about $200.
The tanks all have the same CGA 580 fitting on them so I've been able to
get oxygen, N2 and Ar in the same size with the same regulator.
<p>
If your operation is set up like our local gas shop, you have an industry side
and a retail side of the business. I'm not a industrial customer, but I make
it a habit of going to the industrial dock  in person for my gases, its much
cheaper then calling in and getting the sales person who seems to jack up the
price when you pick it up at the retail end of things. It's easier and cheaper
to go buy it from the dock clerk. BTW, if you're hunting for something pure
like krypton, Try <A HREF="http://www.spectra-gases.com/">Spectra Gases</A>.
Or one of the others that cater to the laser industry.  Even after the hazmat
shipping fee, buying a bottle from Spectra was much cheaper then getting it
locally. The large company around here varied their krypton price on a day to
day basis like it was on the stock market. Spectra's quote was about 1/3rd
their price even after shipping. 
<p>
(From: Tom Miller (tmiller@umaryland.edu).)
<p>
The place I checked gave a price of $160 to purchase a 40 cu. ft. tank with a
fill. Refills are $60.  I have access to the "R" tanks used for medical O2 and
these are 20 cu ft (tank is ~2 ft tall and 4 in diameter) and have a tank
valve like scuba type gear. I guess the valve could be changed to some
standard but it would be nice to use an O2 regulator as they are designed for
low pressure and low flow.  I wonder if the O2 regulator would work with the
high He mix?  When I talked to the gas supplier, they said to use a He
regulator.
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
You can change the valve on the "R" tank, as almost all tanks use 3/4" NPT
threads.  This is a job, though, because the valves are put in REAL tight.
when I owned a welding gas supply company, we had a clamp rig that would hold
the tank while we pulled on a closed-box wrench attached to a 6 ft cheater.
still usually required some heating. One thing to watch for is the thread
sealant.  If the gas co used pipe dope, you'll never get it clean enough
(short of vacuum baking) for high purity gas.
<p>
You really do need to use a helium regulator for He.  The reason is the He
atom is so small that it'll through the rubber diaphragm of most regulators
like a dose of salts!  He regulators typically have a 316 SS diaphragm and a
copper crush gasket.  Helium's kind of tough to hold onto for any length of
time.  At the welding gas co, we kept close track of the code dates on our
tanks because if we let one sit around for a long time, the He would diffuse
through the walls and lower the pressure.  Got complaints from customers. :-)
Also be aware that ordinary He sold for balloons has a goodly chunk of air in
it.  You can get an inexpensive catalytic gas scrubber from Matheson Gas that
will clean up the stream but probably not worth it.  Just get clean gas.
<p>
I buy my high purity gas from <A HREF="http://www.spectra-gases.com/">Spectra
Gases</A>.  They sell gas in disposable cylinders.  A 20l cylinder that looks
like a propane torch cylinder but with a needle valve filled with Neon is
about $50.  A 100l cylinder is about $140.  This is spectroscopy grade gas.
And when the tank is empty, it is useful for a number of things plus the 100l
tank has a standard CGA valve so you can put it on your "E" tank :-) I use a
20l tank as a "day tank" on my bench.  I refill it from the 100l tank.  That
way if I leave a valve open I don't trash the whole 100l tank.  These are
really good guys to work with and they have all kinds of gas.  Need 20l of
Xenon?  Got a BIG pocketbook?  They got it. :)

<h3><A NAME="contdns">Tips for Dealing with a Neon Sign Shop</A></h3>

Neon sign shops can be a fabulous potential source for inexpensive neon sign
transformers, glass tubing, electrodes, vacuum equipment, and glass working
services.  Gas lasers and neon signs share a lot in common so the people who
work on neon may be very cooperative if you convince them you are serious about
building a laser.  I have even heard of someone not only getting his HeNe
glass work done by a friendly glass bender, but having the tube filled
with helium and neon at the proper pressure (along with the required
bake/back-fills) as well.  However, you do need to use at least some common
sense when you walk in (and maybe a bit more) so as not to just be shown the
exit:
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
When someone contacts me with a request for a transformer, for example, I'm
pretty cooperative once I determine that they probably won't hurt themselves
and aren't planning on using it for practical jokes.  I don't need the
liabilities.  I buy used transformers in bulk from a large regional shop, test
and refurb them and either use them for my neon or resell them to
experimenters.  I get a buck a kilovolt for as-is units.  If you're lucky, a
shop may give you transformers but it generally greases the skids for future
requests to offer to pay a bit.
<p>
A few other things to keep in mind when visiting a neon shop:

<ul>
<li>First, most guys can't do good bending while chatting so don't distract
 the bender when he's working.
<p>
<li>Second, neon work tends to come in oh-my-gawd rush burps separated by
 periods of stark boredom.  If you find the bender buried up to his ars in
 patterns and glass and with that wild-eyed look in his eyes, it's probably
 better to return later.  On the other hand, if the guy's sitting around
 blowing push pins out of a glass tube blowgun, then he'll probably not be
 too busy to bother. :-)
<p>
<li>Finally if you want to get custom glasswork done by the bender, make sure
 he knows up front that you're willing to pay by the hour for his time.  We
 get hit up all the time for cut-rate or free work so we're kind of sensitive
 about that.

<h2>Introduction to Glass Working</h2>
<h3><A NAME="concgw0">Laser Tube Fabrication</A></h3>

The following mainly applies to the traditional gas lasers like the HeNe,
Ar/Kr ion, HeHg, and possibly CO2 where the entire laser discharge tube may be
a single glass structure - it is made in one piece from various individual
pieces that are fused together.  The N2 laser does not require glass working
of this type.
<p>
As laboratory apparatus goes, what you need for any of these lasers is pretty
mundane: A few tubes joined together with butt or tee joints, a few dimples
or bumps, some angled cuts, and pieces attached with glue.
<p>
Note that at least in principle, it is possible to construct these lasers
without actually fusing glass pieces together as Epoxy or other adhesive
and/or vacuum rated flexible tubes and clamps can be used.  However, such a
structure is not nearly as stable and are not recommended.  In addition, the
added nooks and crannies of clamped pieces and places with glue that can
outgas mean that achieving the required level of vacuum and maintaining it is
much more difficult.
<p>
There are basically two ways to go about obtaining the needed assembly of
tubes, electrodes, Brewster windows, and so forth.
<ol>
<li>Have someone else do it!  Assuming you can find a cooperative individual
   or pay a neon sign shop or laboratory equipment fabricator, this is by far
   the easiest especially if you have to start from ground-zero.  For someone
   at all experienced in this sort of stuff, the assembly of the main portion
   of a typical laser tube (not including the Brewster windows) is a 20 minute
   job if all the bits and pieces are available.  If you can arrange that your
   design uses the same sizes and types of glass tubing that they commonly
   deal with, so much the better.
<p>
<li>Learn enough of the skill of glass working to do it yourself.  This is by
   far more fun and who knows, maybe you have a talent for the sort of glass
   art exhibited in museums.  This really isn't as difficult as it might seem
   at first.  Glass working is a skill and you will no doubt create some
   pretty interesting failures at first.  But with a little practice (OK,
   maybe a lot of practice!), butt and tee joints, and dimples and bumps will
   become second nature.  We aren't talking about fancy decorative glass
   blowing, mostly just basic cutting and joining.
</ol>
Glass working as it relates to laboratory apparatus fabrication has been
covered in the Amateur Scientist columns as well.  See: Glass blowing,
technique explained, Scientific American, May, 1964, pg. 129.

A recommended book on this topic is:

  like Borders. :)

skills that are needed for laser tube frabrication.  But, here's a Web site

useful data and tables, and more.

<h3><A NAME="concgw1">Types of Glass</A></h3>

What we call "glass" is made from silicon dioxide (SiO2) and other additives to
produce the wide range of properties of various glasses that we are familiar:
from window glass to Pyrex cooking and labware; colored glass bottles and
stained glass windows, light bulbs of all shapes and sizes; and optical glass
for lenses, mirrors, and prisms.  SiO2 is the same stuff that constitutes
beach sand and the insulating layers of integrated circuit chips.

Glass is an amorphous material - it has no crystalline structure and is really
a liquid at room temperature.  A liquid, you say????  Well, a slow moving
liquid at least.  As its temperature is increased, glass becomes softer but
has no distinct melting point (compared to water, salt, or any other material
that forms a crystalline structure where there is a distinct phase transition
from a solid to liquid state).
<p>
The two types glass which will be of most interest for laser construction are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Soda-lime (S-L) glass is the most widely manufactured type (roughly 90% by
 weight) used for plate glass windows, bottles, light bulbs, glassware, a
 zillion other common products.  It is fairly soft to begin with and can be
 worked at a relatively low temperature.  S-L glass consists of about 72%
 sand or silica, 15% sodium oxide or soda, 9% calcium oxide or lime, and
 4% of other minor ingredients.
<p>
 S-L glass is not suitable for high temperature apparatus (e.g., the bore of
 a high power laser) but should be fine for most other uses. 
<p>
<li>Boro-silicate (B-S) glass (commonly called Pyrex which is one brand name)
 is much harder and resistant to high temperatures but must be worked at a much
 higher temperature as well (a torch burning natural gas and pure oxygen, for
 example.  It consists of about 80% silica, 4% alkali, 2% alumina, and nearly
 13% boric oxide.
<p>
 B-S glass can probably be used everywhere but the difficulties in working
 make this unattactive.  However, if someone else is doing the glass-work...
</ul>
<p>
Fused silica (Vycor) and pure quartz are two highly heat resistant materials
that you hopefully won't have to shape since they have even higher softening
(or in the case of quartz, a crystal, melting) points as well!
<p>
If you order common laboratory glass tubing, it will likely be made of S-L
glass though other types are also available - make sure you specify what you
want since for some of the laser parts, heat resistance is an issue.  Most
beakers, flasks, and anything else that may be heated are made of Pyrex or
the equivalent B-S formulation of another manufacturer.  However much other
labware is of the S-L variety.  Since the coefficient of thermal expansion
also differs for the two types of glass, there may be problems in attempting
to mix them in a given structure.

<h3><A NAME="concgw2">Cutting Glass Tubing</A></h3>

For small tubes - say less than 1/2" in diameter, cutting is, well, a snap!
<p>
All you need is a small triangular file (new or in excellent condition, not
rusty and clogged with something disgusting) and perhaps some spit. :-)
<ul>
<li>Place the tube to be cut on a solid surface and go over it once at the
  desired location with the file - pressing firmly but not so hard that you
  risk cracking it right then and there.  There is no need to go around the
  tube - one location should suffice.  The objective is to simply nick the
  tubing.  You don't need - or want - to be sawing it with the file!
<p>
<li>While holding the tube in two hands, apply a bending force to the tube with
  the filed nick away from you - to spread it apart in that direction.  It
  should snap in two quite cleanly.  Once you get the hang of this, the result
  will be clean and at right-angles to the tube axis, barely distinguishable
  from a diamond sawed cut!
</ul>
Sometimes, wetting the filed location with a bit of spit or tap water will
aid in the process.
<p>
Practice on some scrap pieces of tubing.  In on time you will be turning all
the neon tubing in your neighborhood to small bits suitable for making beaded
necklaces! 
<p>
This also works for larger diameter tubing (like CRT necks) but a longer
crevice may be needed - try to keep it straight.  In some cases, one pass all
the way around will be needed.
<p>
There are also hot wire cutters (the heated wire produces local stress which
fractures the glass).  For large or irregularly shaped objects, the best tool
is a power driven diamond grit glass cutting wet wheel - a water cooled miter
saw for glass and ceramics!  For small pieces, a Dremel tool (compact high
speed multipurpose hand-held grinder/saw/sander/drill) can be use though
you may go through (non-diamond coated) cutting wheels rather quickly. :(
Dentists have nice high speed drills with diamond impregnated bits, cutters,
sanding disks, buffers, and other widgets - and they are water cooled!
Perhaps, you know a friendly dentist?  "Please be patient Ms. Jones, we'll get
to your root canal as soon as we finish cutting these glass pieces for Jerry's
laser". :) 
<p>
Any sharp edges left by the cutting operation should be smoothed with fine
sandpaper or in the flame of your glass working torch.

<h3><A NAME="concgw3">Glass Working 101</A></h3>

All glass working consists of four steps:
<ol>
<li>Heating.  This is going to be done with a flame of some kind:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>A common propane torch or natural gas burner using air is just hot enough
  to soften S-L glass.  A bunsen burner works - barely.  Other types of lab
  burners are better.
<p>
 <li>With the use of pure oxygen, the flames from these all run much hotter
  and that is what you is really needed to be able to do any sort of glass
  work easily and consistently (or borosillicate glass at all).
<p>
 <li>An oxy-acetylene or oxy-hydrogen torch will be needed to easily deal with
  some types of heat resistant glass and fused quartz.  (CAUTION: Hydrogen
  flames tend to be invisible!)
 </ul>
<p>
 At the proper temperature, glass has the consistency of soft taffy - easy
 to bend and shape but not so soft that it runs or drips.  Part of the skill
 (and fun) is keeping the glass at just the right temperature as it is
 worked.  As the glass approaches the proper temperature, the flame will
 take on a yellow tinge from the sodium ions in the glass (the soda part)
 and the glass itself may appear red or orange-hot itself.
<p>
<li>Working: Bending, joining, pulling, dimpling, blowing, etc. is done while
 the glass is maintained at a relatively constant temperature in the flame.
 Glass cools quickly so repeated or constant heating is needed.  Some
 positive pressure in the glass parts may be needed to prevent them from
 collapsing - or to blow bubbles!  The surface tension of the soft glass is
 going to be both our friend (since it will help smooth out much of the
 damage you will inflict) and foe (since it will tend to want to cause tube
 ends to collapse or other holes to expand).  Usually two hands and a mouth
 (safely at the end of a length of rubber tubing!) are enough but at times
 you might wish to be an octopus!
<p>
<li>Once the particular joint or whatever is formed to your satisfaction, the
 piece must be cooled so that it solidifies.  However, you cannot just dunk
 the whole affair in a bucket of water as the sudden temperature change will
 cause your hard work to shatter into a million pieces (sometimes it will do
 this even without such help!)  It must go through a process of annealing
 where a lower temperature flame is run back and forth over a large area of
 the glass - beyond that which was dealt with originally.  The cooler flame
 can be obtained by reducing the air or oxygen supply to the torch.
 Fortunately, this takes only a couple of minutes for anything we are
 interested in constructing (unlike the 17 foot diameter Palomar telescope
 mirror which required over a year of annealing).  Note that there is no
 real way of knowing how much annealing is enough - it is just something
 that one does based on recommendation or experience.
<p>
 Surrounding larger pieces with warm vermiculite after flame annealing will
 further slow the cooling process.  Vermiculite is ground up mica and is sold
 in garden shops.  :)  This is probably not necessary for the sorts of things
 needed for home-built lasers but one never can tell where your activities
 will lead!
<p>
<li>Cooling.  The worked and annealed area will still be very hot.  Set it
 down on a non-flammable material or better yet, in such a way that the hot
 parts do not touch anything until it is cool enough to touch.  This allows
 it to cool slowly and uniformaly, further minimizing the chances of stress
 cracks.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="concgw4">Gas Flames</A></h3>

A gas flame (natural gas, propane, etc.) adjusted for hottest temperature
(optimum fuel:air ratio) is divided into several parts:
<PRE>

         Tip---> /\ (Dark Blue)
                /  \
      Cone --> / /\ \ (Light Blue)
              | |  | |
             _|_|__|_|_
     Burner |          |

</PRE>
Great diagram, huh?
<p>
Note that it is mostly shades of blue - there should be minimal yellow or
orange (indicating that there is adequate air/oxygen) but the flame should not
begin to separate from the burner (indicating too much).  There should be no
smoke or soot from such a flame.
<p>
The hottest location is just above the inner cone.
<p>
With soda-lime glass, once the glass is hot enough to work, the flame will
take on a yellow color due to the sodium ions in the glass.
<p>
With the air/oxygen supply cut off, the flame will be long and yellow and may
produce black smoke and soot.  This will be the proper temperature for the
annealing step.
<p>
Note: Where you have control of the air/oxygen supply as with a professional
glass working torch (or Oxy-Acetyline welder, for that matter), light it up
by first opening just the gas supply a small amount and then adding air/oxygen
and adjusting gas flow after the flame is lit.  Shut down in the reverse
sequence.  This avoids unsightly pops, bangs, and other explosive behavior.
In other words, always make sure the gas is turned on first and shut down last!

<h3><A NAME="concgw5">Glass Working Examples</A></h3>

The only way to really be come proficient at this is to practice.  You will
create many many interesting disasters at first but glass is cheap.  After a
while, these sorts of 'simple' procedures will become automatic and second
nature.  Who knows, even your failures may find a place in the Museum of
Modern Art!
<ul>
<li>Smoothing a piece of cut glass tubing:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Heat the cut end in the flame near the inner cone.
<p>
 <li>Watch the edges.  As the glass softens, the sharp edges will start to
  round off.  Even chips and unsightly blemishes will melt away....
<p>
 <li>Don't push your luck.  If you leave in the hot part of the flame too long,
  the tube will close up and you will have to start over (or have fun and
  blow a bubble)!
<p>
 <li>Anneal for a minute or so and allow it to cool.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Bending a glass tube.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Holding the tube at both ends, heat the area of the bend until the color
  of the flame becomes yellowish.  Keep it moving - back and forth and
  rotating.  Don't restrict the heated area too much - you don't want the
  bend to be too sharp (too localized).  A good size to aim for is a bend
  radius of no less than 5 times the diameter of the tubing - at least until
  you get the hang of all of this.
<p>
  For large diameter (e.g., greater than 1/4") or thin walled tubing, cap
  one end and attach a rubber hose to the other to use as a blow-pipe so you
  can apply a little positive pressure (by *gently* blowing into the hose)
  to keep the glass from collapsing - don't blow too hard or you will blow a
  bubble or rupture the tube entirely!
<p>
  <li>Once it is soft, genatly help it along to the desired shape.  Don't rush.
   When the glass is the consistency of soft taffy, the bend will practically
   happen on its own.
<p>
 <li>Anneal for a minute or so and allow it to cool.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Making a butt joint.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Cap all but one of the open ends of both pieces except where the joint is
  to be made and attach your blow-hose to the remaining one.
<p>
 <li>Heat the joint locations of BOTH pieces until soft.
<p>
 <li>Bring the two pieces together straight but with a slight twisting motion
  so they touch and fuse.  Attempt to align them as perfectly as possible -
  once together, you cannot pull them apart without making a mess.  However,
  the surface tension of the glass will come to your rescue as long as things
  aren't too out of hand.
<p>
  Note that the key to this is to get a seal all the way around when the
  pieces are first brought together.  Otherwise, any gaps will tend to open
  up and there will be no way to apply positive pressure to keep the whole
  affair from collapsing.
<p>
 <li>Continue heating and rotating the combined piece so that the glass will
  flow together due to surface tension.  Maintain a slight positive pressure
  to prevent the joint from collapsing.  Keep it moving.  Eventually, uneven
  spots will tend to disappear and what you thought was a disaster may turn
  out to be quite respectable.
<p>
 <li>Anneal for a minute or so and allow it to cool.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Making a T-joint.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Cap all but one of the open ends of the piece to which the side-arm of
  the T is to be attached and connect your blow-hose the it.  Cap all the
  open ends of the side-arm piece.
<p>
 <li>Heat the location on the tube where the side-arm is to be attached using
  the fine inner cone of the gas flame - you want it localized to punch a
  hole.
<p>
 <li>Once it is hot, blow a quick bubble to make a hole - then heat the wall
  of the bubble until it melts away leaving a hole.
<p>
 <li>While keeping the area of the hole warm, heat the end of the side-arm
  until it is also soft.
<p>
 <li>Bring the two pieces together straight but with a slight twisting motion
  so they touch and fuse.  As with the butt joint, you only get one shot at
  this so take care to get them where you want them to end up!
<p>
  Note that the key to this is to get a seal all the way around when the
  pieces are first brought together.  Otherwise, any gaps will tend to open
  up and there will be no way to apply positive pressure to keep the whole
  affair from collapsing.
<p>
 <li>Continue heating and rotating the combined piece so that the glass will
  flow together due to surface tension.  Maintain a slight positive pressure
  to prevent the joint from collapsing.  Keep it moving.  Eventually, uneven
  spots will tend to disappear and what you thought was a disaster may turn
  out to be quite respectable.
<p>
 <li>Anneal for a minute or so and allow it to cool.
 </ul>
<p>
 I actually prefer to cheat: Instead of joing a straight piece to the side
 of another, where possible, I start with a small glass T connection, cut off
 its ends if necessary, and joint it to the main tube using the butt joint.
 Depending on the specific diameters and types of glass, this may be a better
 approach.
<p>
<li>Flaring the end of a glass tube.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Cap all but the end to be flared and another one where you attach your
  blow-hose.
<p>
 <li>Heat the end to be flared until it totally collapses and seals itself.
<p>
 <li>Blow into the assembly to create a bubble.
<p>
 <li>Continue heating the thin-walled bubble until it melts and then heat the
  remaining walls until they flow to the required size.
<p>
 <li>Anneal for a minute or so and allow it to cool.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Creating a dimple.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Heat the tubing in the precise area where you want the dimple - as small
  an area as possible using the tip of the inner cone of the flame.
<p>
 <li>Use a pointed carbon rod (which won't stick to glass) to gently indent
  the area.
<p>
 <li>Anneal for a minute or so and allow it to cool. 
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="conhgwl">Home-Built Glass Working Lathe</A></h3>

Even with a lot of practice, it is difficult to make consistently high quality
joints between various size glass tubing and other parts free-hand.  A glass
working lathe is a fixture that permits the parts to be mounted in such a way
that they can be rotated together in the gas flame(s) while maintaining
precise alignment and leaving at least one hand free (the other would do the
rotation - this needn't be motorized) to do other things.  It probably doesn't
make sense to acquire or build a glass working lathe for the fabrication of a
single laser tube but if several more complex lasers are in your future, it
might be worth considering.
<p>
A commercial glass-working lathe is a fairly expensive device that can't be
justified for sporadic and limited hobby work.  However,
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/gwl/">A Home-Built Glass Working
Lathe</A> provides a short description of a piece of equipment which can be
used in the fabrication of the plasma tube, water jacket, and other glass
components for a variety of lasers as well as for other scientific glassware
applications.

<h3><A NAME="concgw6">Learning Glass Working Skills</A></h3>

There are many Web sites with glass working information.
<A HREF="http://www.teralab.co.uk/Glass_Blowing/Glass_Blowing_Menu.htm">Teralab
- Glass Blowing for Vacuum Devices</A> is just one example.  But more
hobbyist-types do this than you might thinkg.
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
One way to start is to subscribe to a couple of email discussion groups related
to glass working.  There are 2 lists I'm involved with:
<ul>
<li>neon-l@lists.io.com.
<li>hotglass@list.bb.net.  Email: <A HREF=
  "mailto:hotglass-request@hotglass.com">hotglass-request@hotglass.com</A> to
  subscribe.
</ul>
See the section: <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirnld2">Laser (Email) Listservers</A>
for other possibilities.
<p>
The list discussion tends to be esoteric.  There's no substitute in learning
to blow than to do it!  I taught myself to blow glass so it can be done.
First, get the books mentioned in my article on the web page.  Then find a
neon shop and arrange to spend some time in the shop.  Most shops will let you
watch for a bit but it's only proper to compensate the benders for their time.
most benders work on piecework so time = money.  When I first got started, I
slipped a bender in Atlanta a C-note to let me tag along behind for a day.  I
had his undivided attention.  This is VERY important.  The early motor skills
you learn will be the foundation that you build on with practice and if you
learn incorrect basics, it will be hard as hell to correct it.  It is also
important to understand that there are some people whose motor skills will not
let them learn to blow glass.  I've seen people who went through $6k, 9 week
neon bending classes and not be able to do a 90 without it flattening out.
You can usually tell within a few hours' work.  If you end up being one of
those people, just live with it.  You'll waste a lot of money and make no
progress.  Avail yourself of someone who can.
<p>
After you progress to one level, don't be afraid to spend a little money for a
day of tutoring from a master.  I've been bending for several years and I
still try to go a couple of times to someone better than me and study under
them.  Now you can usually get someone to do it for free but things are a lot
more clean if you simply pay the expert for his expertise.  You'll profit in
the long run.

<h3><A NAME="concgw7">Here's Someone Who Has Offered Glass Working

Here is a possible way of getting your custom glass work done.  I do not know

there will be high quality results:
<p>
(From: Georges Koff (kopp@chemistry.mcgill.ca).)
<p>
Although the bulk of my work is for industry and research, I do work for 
individuals.
<p>
I am a professional scientific glassblower, a member of "The American
Scientific Glassblower Society".  For the last 27 years, I have been in
charge of the glassblowing shop of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
I have been working in research for the last 33 years in Europe and Canada and
have a lot of experience in the design of scientific glassware, high vacuum 
technology, glass-to-metal seals, special glasses, etc.
<p>
I design and work from blue prints so any drawings could be submitted
including those in electronic form (most formats are supported).
<p>
I do not consider the type of laser but the kind of glassware to be blown.  So
as long as the design of the laser tube is fully specified, it doesn't matter
whether it is for a CO2, HeNe, argon ion, or other type of laser.  I most
likely should be able to make them.

<li>Back to <A HREF="lasercon.htm#contoc">Amateur Laser Construction Sub-Table
 of Contents</A>
<h2>Electrodes and Getters</h2>
<h3><A NAME="connse0">Types of Electrodes Used With Home-Built
 Lasers</A></h3>

The electrodes used with home-built gas lasers are of two types, both of
the 'cold' variety:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Neon sign electrodes purchased from a neon sign parts and equipment
 supplier.  They use a material which minimizes the 'work function' and this
 allows higher currents to be flow at a lower voltage drop and without
 degradation.  These come sealed into a section of lead glass or Pyrex tubing
 which can then be fused (though your noteworthy glass working skills) to the
 remainder of your laser tube assembly.  They can be Epoxied in place as well,
 heat considerations permitting.  Neon sign electrodes are specified in terms
 of maximum current, tubing type and size, and tubulated or non-tubulated (with
 or without exhaust tube).
<p>
 Neon sign electrodes may need to be 'activated' by heating prior to use.
 See the sections below for information on ways of doing this.
<p>
<li>Simple metal electrodes you fabricate.  These are almost always used for
 the CO2 laser but may be applicable to other lower current lasers as well,
 as well as to the flashlamp for the dye laser.  For the CO2 laser in
 particular, the electrodes can just be ordinary copper plumbing fittings or
 aluminum tubes or blocks.  Most modern helium-neon lasers use a cylinder of
 aluminum for the cathode and the mirror mount at the other end of the tube
 for the anode.
</ul>
<p>
A third type may be found in some lasers and is, of course, is commonly used
in vacuum types including CRTs and microwave magnetrons:
<ul>
<li>Thermionic (heated) electrodes.  An AC or DC current is passed though
 a coil of tungsten wire to heat the electrode to incandescence (orange to
 yellow) which promotes thermionic emission and reduces the work function.
 None of the home-built lasers needs to use this approach.  However, commercial
 ion and other lasers as well as really old helium-neon lasers use a hot
 cathode design.  (As above, the anode can almost always be just a piece of
 metal or thin wire.)
</ul>

The cathode (negative electrode) is usually where the most heat dissipation
occurs due to ion bombardment.  Thus, it is generally made large and of a
material and shape to minimize heating.  The anode can often just be a little
wire through a glass-to-metal seal.

<h3><A NAME="conghb">Getters in Home-Built Lasers</A></h3>

A getter provides a means of ridding a permanently sealed system of the last
traces of unwanted gas molecules by chemically combining with them to create a
stable, non-gaseous compound.  Common getter materials are designed to react
with as many gases as possible.  This includes O2, N2, CO2, H2, and many
others but NOT noble gases since they won't react with much of anything.
So these getters can be used with noble gas lasers like the HeNe and Ar/Kr
ion type, but not with most others.  The getter is that silvery or black
metallic spot visible in a vacuum receiving tube (if you remember those) or
CRT (though it may be hidden by the external or internal coating).  Some HeNe
laser tubes have getters but this doesn't seem that common today and those
that do often have not had them activated (the getter electrode is present
but the getter spot is missing.  I suppose that modern vacuum systems and
processing methods are so good and hard-seal tubes don't really leak, so there
is no need for a getter).  Argon ion laser tubes may also have getters but
they are more likely to be hidden behind metal and beryllia.
<p>
The getter is a one-time use device and is ruined by exposure to any
significant amount of gases in air like oxygen and nitrogen (more than a dozen
molecules or so - OK, just a slight exaggeration!).  Thus, their use doesn't
make sense with a flowing gas or continuously pumped system even if all it
uses are noble gases.  And, the residue from the getter reaction may be a
powdery substance that will contaminate the laser tube.
<p>
Therefore, none of the home-built lasers requires or should include a getter
unless the intention is to permanently seal off the tube - which isn't
recommended unless your gases are ultra-pure, your vacuum system is superb,
and your attention to minimizing contamination is equally superb.  If the
tube isn't hermetically sealed, air is almost certain to enter the tube
between uses at the very least.
<p>
So, you ask, "How does one install a getter if it is ruined by air?".  Good
question!  The answer is that it is manufactured in an inactive form as a
compound that is inert and contained in a small U-cross-section metal
structure (the getter electrode).  This must be activated by heating (once the
tube has been pumped down and sealed off) to decompose the inert compound
driving off a reactive metal that forms the getter spot.  Should that metallic
spot turn milky white or red (depending on the actual compound used), the
getter has outlived its usefulness and the tube is probably leaky and no
longer functional.
<p>
Apparently, depleted uranium (which is not radioactive - or at least not
<i>very</i> radioactive depending on purity) makes an excellent getter after
being processed to convert it to the so-called 'active' form.  For obvious
reasons, I'm not going to go into any more detail here but a search of the
relevant scientific literature of the 1960s will turn up the complete recipe
if you really want to build a nuclear laser and can get a few grams of the
stuff. :)

<h3><A NAME="conmoh">Methods to Activate Neon Sign Electrodes and
 Getters</A></h3>

All neon sign (and most other types of) electrodes need to be heated via
an external power source to prepare their surface for use ('activation').
Getters in these lasers as well as some commercial helium-neon and other gas
laser tubes may need to be activated or reactivated to clean up contamination
due to poor manufacturing or air leakage.
<p>
During the manufacture of commercial tubes, they may be made red hot.  My
solar heater (see below) probably doesn't achieve this (for HeNe laser tube
getters) but it also takes awhile.  The minimum temperature for activation
probably depends on the type of material used but I expect that it is at least
several hundred &deg;C.  There are a variety of ways of providing the
source to heat the electrode or getter:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Direct current.  In some cases, a pair of wires are available and passing
 a high current (e.g., several amps) through the  electrode or getter will heat
 it in a very controllable way.  This arrangement is rarely provided in
 commercial tubes but may be possible for home-built lasers.
<p>
<li>Glow discharge.  Where the electrode or getter is connected to an isolated
 terminal, it may be possible to apply a DC current through the tube to use
 it as the cathode (negative electrode), heating via ion bombardment of the
 glow discharge.  Unfortunately, in many commercial tubes, the getter is
 electrically connected to one of the electrodes (usually the cathode of a
 HeNe or argon ion tube) so there is no way to direct the current only to the
 getter electrode.
<p>
<li>Solar or halogen lamp heating.  A large Fresnel lens (e.g., one from an
 overhead transparency projector) may be used to focus light onto the get
 electrode or getter to provide the heating.  However, some of these lenses
 are of poor quality (at least for our purposes) and depending on the
 materials involved, most of the light may be reflected rather than absorbed.
 I've activated the getter in a sick HeNe laser tube using a jerry-rigged Solar
 furnace made from a $1 7" x 10" plastic Fresnel lens intended as a reading
 magnifier.  See the sections: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#consol">Simple Solar
 Heater</A> for details and <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhldc">HeNe Tube Lases
 but Color of Discharge Changes Along Length of Bore</A> for a description of
 its use in reviving a helium-neon laser tube.
<p>
<li>Laser heating.  The focused beam from a high power laser diode, ion, or
 solid state laser should be ideal if it can be directed into the area of the
 active material in the electrode or getter.  How much the laser beam will
 need to be focused will depend on its power and original beam diameter.
 It was very easy to detect an effect using a 1 W fiber-coupled laser diode and
 1" focal length lens to focus the beam inside the getter electrode of a
 HeNe laser tube.  Almost any high power laser (CW or pulsed) except CO2
 (since its 10.6 um wavelength won't penetrate the glass) should be suitable.
 Just take care with respect to reflections from shiny surfaces!
<p>
<li>RF heating.  The output of a 50 to 100 W RF source can be coupled to the
 getter or electrode with an RF matching transformer.  However, this will also
 likely excite the residual gases in the tube which may drain power away from
 the area of interest.  However, it is easy to monitor the discharge color as
 as the procedure progresses!
<p>
<li>Induction heating.  This is basically similar to RF heating but operates
 at a lower frequency (e.g., 50 kHz) rather than several MHz.  Energy is
 coupled to the getter or electrode as though it was the single turn
 secondary of a transformer.  At this frequency, there probably won't be
 excitation of the residual gases in the tube.  See the section:
 <A HREF="coniht">Basic Induction Heater Circuit</A>.
<p>
<li>Microwave heating. The use of the family microwave oven is probably
 not to be recommended for a couple of reasons:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The size of the oven cavity will significantly limit your ability to deal
  with larger tubes.  Don't even think about drilling holes....
 <p>
 <li>There is virtually no way to limit heating to the getter other structures
  including the glass tube and glass-to-metal seals may get hot enough to crack
  or melt even if they don't appear to be heating at all.  While the typical
  ring-shaped getter electrode may be close enough to the ideal size for the
  2.45 GHz microwave radiation (with a circumference of 1/2 of the 12.4 cm
  wavelength), and under ideal conditions of placement and luck will heat up
  to a nice orange glow in a couple of seconds - control is just too
  critical to be sure of avoiding collateral damage.  The glass cracked on a
  helium-neon laser when I tried this and let it cook for too long. :(
 <p>
 <li>You may be damaged should your parents find out you were using the family
  microwave for these non-conventional applications!
 </ul>
<p>
 Having said that, with care, it might be worth trying.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmic">Using a Microwave Oven to Evaluate and Revive
 HeNe Laser Tubes</A>.  However, whether such treatments help, hurt, and the
 extent to which they last, seem to depend on many factors which aren't
 readily obvious.
</ul>
<p>
CAUTION: Make sure the glass-to-metal seals do not overheat while attempting
any of these procedures!  Also, any procedure you use should restrict heating
to only the electrode itself or its contents.  For getters in particular,
heating the 'white cloud of death' (which might be inevitable with the solar
heater) will likely result in an <b>increase</b> in unwanted gases as it
releases the contamination that had been collected over the eons. :(
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
All regular electrodes must be activated.  Running an un-activated electrode
will crap up a tube in short order.  There is one company that will supply
uncoated electrodes on special order (maybe "Tecnolux" but I'm not sure).  In
any event the coating can be removed with a nitric acid wash.  The electrode
will still need to be heated to outgas it though.  I'm not sure how one would
attach an electrode with epoxy and still get it hot enough to properly outgas.
<p>
Also note that barium carbonate (reduces to barium metal when activated) is
one of the common activation ingredients.  The metallic barium that results
functions well as a getter.  I've experimented to see just how bad a vacuum
I could get away with.  Using my usual brand electrodes, EGL, I can leave up
to about 50 microns of air in the neon tube and still have the electrodes
clean it up fairly rapidly.

<h3><A NAME="conbih">Basic Induction Heater Circuit</A></h3>

An induction heater is just a source of high frequency driving a coupling
coil.  This acts as the primary of a transformer where the secondary is the
object to be heated.  The low voltage but very high current induced thus
heats the object resistively.  Induction cooktops may require multiple kW.
For our purposes, power is much lower, perhaps 50 to 200 watts (though the
schematics aren't all that different).
<p>
The typical circuit is a line powered high frequency driver providing about 300
V p-p to the coupling coil of the induction heating head.  It consists of a
voltage doubler and filter, a half-bridge controller chip like the IR2151
or IR3M02, a pair of N channel MOSFETS, snubber, and return capacitor network.
A half-bridge consists of a pair of switches (MOSFETs in this case, though
bipolar transistors or IGBTs are often used) in series, connected between the
positive and negative DC voltages.  The output is taken from their common
point.  Clearly, only one had better ever on at a given instant!
<p>
The key part of the typical circuit is shown below:

The schematic of a commercial unit that I've seen is based very closely on the
<A HREF="http://www.irf.com/product-info/datasheets/data/ir2151.pdf">IR2151
Half-Bridge Driver Datasheet</A>.
<p>
A typical coupling coil consists of about 200 turns of #18 to #20 magnet wire.
At this time I do not know if it has a ferrite core - I intend to find out.
<p>
Amateur science and hobby outfits like
<A HREF="http://www.amazing1.com/">Information Unlimited</A> have plans,
kits, and assembled induction heater drivers and heads suitable for this
application.  Commercial versions may be available from scientific and neon
sign parts and equipment suppliers.  Or, perhaps, you could borrow that old
diethermy machine sitting in your doctor's back room. :)
<p>
For an alternative to a special induction heater driver, see the section:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#consrp">Sam's Recycled PC Power Supply Induction
Heater</A>.

<h3><A NAME="consrp">Sam's Recycled PC Power Supply Induction Heater</A></h3>

The induction heater driver circuits for firing getters and activating
neon sign electrodes that I have seen produce 300 V p-p at around 50 kHz.
<p>
Well, you know how lazy I am and always wanting to build stuff with
recycled parts. :)  So, rather than going to the hassle of constructing a
line powered half-bridge induction heater driver, guess what's inside a
typical PC switching power supply?  Figure it out yet?  A dual MOSFET 300 V
p-p driver capable of 100 to 200 W!  Cool, huh? :)
<p>
So, I had this really bedraggled slightly water-logged no-name PC power supply
sitting sort of in pieces (minus its case) in a box minding its own business
and decided to see what it could do.  I located the common point of the
MOSFET pair and took a look at that with a scope (grounded to the source of
the lower MOSFET, everything on an isolation transformer for safety) with the
power supply driving my head light load.  Almost perfect!  300 V p-p but the
frequency is a bit lower than I would like - 20 kHz rather than the 50 kHz
used in the commercial induction heater driver.  The lower frequency would
require a larger number of turns on the coupling coil and a lower single-turn
voltage on its secondary (the getter or neon sign electrode), neither of which
is desirable.  Ah! No problem, just change a capacitor or resistor!  The
controller is an IR3M02.  Its timing capacitor looked like a high quality job
so I left that alone.  The resistor was 30K.  I substituted 12K and presto!
It now runs at 50 kHz, apparently none the worse for the experience.  The
MOSFETS, transformer, and rectifiers still seem to be cool enough.  The
waveform still looks clean.  I suppose the switching losses are now about
2.5 times what they were before, but I won't be running this continuously at
full power.  I don't know whether the range of load regulation will be the
same as before but I really don't care as long as nothing blows up.  The
supply even had the same configuration of split caps and snubber as the sample
induction heater circuit so I didn't even need to add those components!  I
then attached a cable and connector for the drive and return connection to the
coupling coil in the induction heating head.
<p>
Note that due to the low duty cycle at the light (no pun...) load, the
waveform looks more like a modified sine-wave than an ideal squarewave but
should be acceptable.  With a larger load, it should more closely approach a
squarewave shape.
<p>
WARNING: Consider doing this at your own risk.  PC power supplies are directly
connected to the power line - use an isolation transformer for safety.  The
output drive is 300 V p-p with a few hundred WATTS available, at least
momentarily.  This is an extremely dangerous setup in any case - make sure
everything is well insulated.  Never change connections with the power on.
The main filter capacitors in the power supply can store a lethal charge for
quite some time - always confirm that they have discharged and/or discharge
them if necessary before touching anything - a couple of 47K, 2 W resistors
should be added as bleeders if there aren't any originally (though it will
still take a minute or two for the caps to fully discharge).  It is also quite
possible that any attempt at changing the power supply operating frequency
will result in instant smoke.  Although it worked once, this doesn't
necessarily generalize to other PC power supplies and not all designs are
based on the dual MOSFET drive circuit.
<p>
To calculate the inductance needed for the coupling coil, I assume that
the maximum available power is about 100 W (to err on the safe side,
hopefully!) which for the 100 VRMS drive (which is about what this is) would
have an impedance of 100 ohms.  The inductance then follows from:
L = Z/(2 * pi * f).  For f = 50 kHz, the result is about 300 microHenries.
<p>
According to an ancient Allied Electronics Data Handbook, the following
formula will give the inductance of a multi-layer coil "to within
approximately 1% for nearly all small air-core coils".
<PRE>
                                     0.8 * r * N<sup>2</sup>
                        L = -------------------------------
                             (6 * r) + ( 9 * l) + (10 * b)
</PRE>
Where:
<ul>
<li>L = Resulting inductance in microhenries.
<li>N = Total number of turns.
<li>r = Mean radius in inches.
<li>l = Length of coil in inches.
<li>b = Depth of coil (max. radius - min. radius) in inches.
</ul>
Don't you just love the mixed units - this was before the forced conversion
to everything Metric! :)
<p>
Anyhow, from this equation, it looks like about 100 turns on a 1 inch form
should do it.  Stay tuned.  Next exciting installment: Winding the coupling
coil.

<h3><A NAME="conss1">Sam Schwartz's RF Power Oscillator for Heating
 Getters</A></h3>

So, perhaps my whimpy PC power supply based system isn't going to be
adequate.  Here's one that should be!:
<p>
(From: Sam Schwartz (Emale98@aol.com).)
<p>
I have built a power oscillator for firing getters that should work well
for HeNe and other types of laser tubes.  The complete schematic is shown
in <A HREF="sspo1sch.pdf">Sam Schwartz's High Power RF Oscillator</A>.
<p>
The oscillator uses an 813 vacuum tube.  I burned up a handful of power MOSFETs
before deciding a tube was a better way to go, at least easier for the amount 
of time I wanted to put into the project. The work coil should be made of 
aluminum rod and not copper, unless it is water cooled. The heating in the 
secondary of the transformer is all skin effect loss, and requires water 
cooling. Alternatively, the heating problem of the transformer secondary 
might have been solved by using a rope size piece of Litz Wire. Notice that 
the primary is Litz. That is no inconvenience in my setup as water is used to 
cool the diffusion pump and the baffle on the pump. All are connected in 
series with plastic tubing. I forgot to mention two items in the drawings: 
There is a twisted pair between the RF head and the Main Box that connects 
the heat control pot in the RF head to the solid state control circuitry in 
the Main Box. Also, there is a wrapping of fiber glass tape, available at any 
plastic store, around the work coil. This prevents accidental breaking of 
glass by inadvertent touching of the coil to the glass. Notice that a current 
rating is given for the 0.003 uF. transmitting mica capacitor that tunes the 
tank coil (transformer primary and reflected secondary) in the RF head. 
That is a necessity as the circulating current in the primary is about 5 
amperes as measured with a current probe. Multiply that by the transformer 
ratio, and you will find a work coil current of over 100 amperes. That helps 
to explain the skin effect heating.
<p>
The frequency of the oscillator is 250 Khz. It will vary somewhat
depending on the size and shape of the heat coil on the transformer
secondary.
<p>
I have used old 1/2" getters out of a vacuum, in open air, as test 
subjects. They will get cherry red in the center of the work coil, even when 
moved around so that they are not centered in the coil. So that should work 
for your uncentered getters. Similarly, one can tie a large nut on a wire and 
suspend it in the coil and it will glow cherry red. It is interesting to put 
small chips of broken glass in the getter ring and watch the glass melt and 
conform to the ring while heated with the work coil !  The heat control is 
very effective in controlling the amount of glow (heat) of any ring shaped 
object in  the work coil. The diameter and number of turns in the work coil 
is not critical, within reason, and may be varied to suit the application. 
Also, it may be oval shaped or other than round.
<p>
When flashing a getter, the heat should be brought up slowly, over a 
few seconds, until the getter starts to glow and then lowered quickly as the 
getter itself goes into a self heating mode. Too much external heat causes 
the getter ring (stainless steel or nickel)  to vaporize and deposit material
over the getter material. The result is a black deposit as seen on the glass.
Am now looking for a spare 813 tube in case my 'old but goody' gives up.
<p>
If you cannot slip the work coil over 
your tube in the vicinity of the getter, you can direct the field with a 
piece of ferrite like that from a flyback transformer. Some of the color 
picture tubes use this technique when the neck is too short to accommodate the 
getter.. They have what's known as an antenna getter, which is a getter on 
the end of a long flexible strap attached to the end of the electron gun. 
When slipped into the CRT, it follows the curvature of the deflection area 
around into the funnel and a part of it finally rests against the inside of 
the cone (funnel). It is activated from the outside of the tube by a work 
coil having a round ferrite core that is placed in the proximity of the 
getter. The back of the getter has a ceramic seat that contacts the glass and 
prevents a "hot spot" that otherwise could crack the glass CRT.
<p>
Here are some notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The Power Oscillator provides a variable range of power up to about 120
 watts for induction heating.  The output power is controlled by 
 duty cycle modulation of the main oscillator and gives a continuous heat 
 control over a wide range.
<p>
<li>The RF coupling transformer was built on a ferrite E-E core which
 was a TDK PQ 40/40. The 40/40 refers to the
 outside dimensions of 40 mm wide and 40 mm high. These are 'E' core halves
 with a rounded interior profile to accommodate a round coil.  The round
 center leg has a diameter of 15.2 mm. The core material is 7C4, which has
 a high saturation flux density rating commensurate with low core loss, and is
 made for switching power transformers. It, or its equivalent, is probably
 available today from other ferrite core suppliers such as Siemens, etc. NO
 air gap is used as the transformer carries no DC current, since it is
 capacitively coupled from the 813 plate feed choke.
<p>
<li>It is essential that the primary winding in the output transformer 
 be made of Litz wire. In my version, I used a bundle of small wires, 
 typically #30, twisted together with an electrical drill.
<p>
<li>It is also necessary that the secondary of the output transformer be 
 supplied with cooling water, otherwise the solder will melt out of the 
 connections.
<p>
<li>The Work Coil should be bent from solid aluminum rod (not copper)
 as it will not oxidize appreciably in a hot oven or from its own heat. One 
 can melt a copper penny located in the work coil at full power!
<p>
<li>It is necessary to deliver the output power from the source to the 
 object to be heated, which is usually some distance away. For convenience and 
 to prevent loss of the output power in the transmission, the output 
 transformer and tuning capacitor are mounted in a separate small box with the 
 work coil mounted on it. A connection between this output box and the main 
 oscillator is by means of large coax. Therefore, the power is delivered at a 
 high voltage and low current (about 2 A) over a relatively long 
 distance without appreciable loss and then the current is increased to 125 
 amperes in the work coil. The buildup of current comes about through the 
 circulating current in the tuned circuit and through the step down ratio of 
 the output transformer.
</ol>
<p>
Additional information on the system and details of the coupling transformer
can be found in <A HREF="sspo1nt.gif">Sam Schwartz's Power Oscillator
Notes</A>.

<h3><A NAME="consol">Simple Solar Heater</A></h3>

I built this contraption in order to activate the getter inside a contaminated
helium-neon laser tube (see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhldc">HeNe
Tube Lases but Color of Discharge Changes Along Length of Bore</A>.
<A HREF="solheat.gif">Solar Heater for Activating Tube Getters</A> shows a
HeNe tube in position ready for a treatment.  (I haven't actually tried it
on anything else so far.)
<p>
The solar concentrator is just a $1 7" x 10" plastic Fresnel lens which is
supposed to be used as a reading magnifier.  It is taped to a wood frame with
two degrees of freedom so that both height and angle can be adjusted depending
on the location of the Sun and height and orientation of the structure of
interest inside the tube.  Despite being rejected as really terrible for its
intended application, this cheap lens is capable of producing a nicely focused
spot less than 1/4" in diameter.  Based on an estimated 600 W per square meter
of noonday Sun where I live, this works out to about 25 W of light energy in
that area.  Sounds like a nice size laser, huh?  A larger lens can be used but
don't go to extremes - even this one can be nasty (especially for any
unsuspecting bug that might wonder too close!).
<p>
It might be a good idea to cover the base with some sort of non-flammable
or fire resistant material to prevent unfortunate 'accidents.  Whatever the
focus of the beam hits will char instantly and 6 foot flames won't be too far
behind!
<p>
I expect it could be used to make some pretty decent hot dogs as well. :)
<p>
So, you ask: "Why isn't this considered as dangerous as a 25 W laser?".  The
main reason is that the Fresnel lens does not produce a collimated beam and it
is virtually impossible to convert it to one.  Yes, putting anything at its
focus will cause the item to be charred, cooked, vaporized, incinerated, or
otherwise damaged.  However, 2 or 3 inches away, it is just a very bright
source of light.  Nonetheless, DON'T ever stare into the light from the
Fresnel lens!

<h2>The Central High School Cyclotron</h2>

These sections summarize my experiences in high school many years ago with an
atom smasher, sort of. :)

<h3><A NAME="concycw">Why is This Here?</A></h3>

OK, so why is this included in a Laser FAQ?  Well, the simple answer is that
it would seem pretty silly in the IR Remote or VCR repair guides, wouldn't
it?! :)  Seriously, there is a great deal of commonality between atom smashers
and lasers - at least in terms of the technologies involved.
<p>
First, the major players (complete names are not included since I am unable to
contact them for permission to make this public):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Donald - was involved in procuring (well, scrounging) the parts including a
 6 ton electromagnet (on a 99 year $1 lease).  This happened before I got
 involved so our paths didn't quite intersect.
<p>
 Donald is now a high power lawyer. :-)
<p>
<li>Douglas - is Don's kid brother and joined our little group about the time I
 got involved.
<p>
 Douglas - is/was involved in Washington, D.C. and at one time held the title
 of "Deputy Assistant to Someone or Something", very high up, recently fired.
<p>
<li>Fred - an electronics buff, friend of mine through high school until our
 paths parted.  Recently we got together again having discovered that we were
 living within a mile of each-other.
<p>
 Fred now develops, markets, and manufactures special purpose linear ICs.
</ul>
<p>
Now, Central High School (CHS) wasn't a technical high school but was and
still is to some extent, one of the principle academic high schools in
Philadelphia, PA, USA.  At that time, it was also an all boys school, with
Girls' High, a long block away.  Now, it is co-ed.
<p>
There were the usual debating, rock climbing, sports, cycling, and all the
other associations, clubs, societies, whatever, typical of any high school.
<p>
There were also the technical ones.  We had an amateur radio society and photo
society, of course.  There were also probably organization for chemistry
and biology but I don't really recall as I wasn't enthusiastic about chemistry
(despite having acquired a cabinet full of beakers, flasks, and such) and
biology was even lower on my list of fun activities.  But I do recall a field
trip to the Pine Barrens in New Jersey to check out the trees. :)
<p>
I also managed to get involved in the Advanced Physics Lab (APL) where I did
inherit a ruby laser based on a mid-60s Popular Science design (that never
worked or maybe I was too chicken to turn up the capacitor charging circuit
to reach threshold).
(See <A HREF="http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/05/01/build-your-own-laser/">
Modern Mechanix - Build Your Own Laser</A> for the original article if you're
curious.)  Mostly, what was done in the APL is that Fred and I
abused burned out light bulbs by among other things, driving a 110 VAC to
2.5 kV transformer on 220 VAC and I would swear that for several seconds,
achieved a plasma jet through the bulb in open air.  But it also looked good
on my academic record!
<p>
There was also the... Cyclotron Society.  Myself, Doug, and Fred were the
principle members.  There was also a guy named Gary but he used the place more
for political reasons and always seemed to find excuses NOT to do anything
technical.  Fred and I eventually got him thrown out of the Cyclotron Society
on the basis of some infraction which to this day I don't know was real or
not.   Douglas was in some ways similar and the room (to be described below)
DID make a good book repository and hangout!  He, at least, didn't interfere
with progress.
<p>
Now, lest you think this is the sort of accelerator you have seen on
documentaries or even bad Sci-Fi movies, you would be disappointed.
It was small - the maximum energy was theoretically if everything was optimal,
maybe 1 million electron volts (1 MEV).  The diameter of the magnet pole
pieces were 7 inches!  However, everything was there - magnets, RF source,
vacuum system, gauges, the works.

<h3><A NAME="concycc">What is a Cyclotron?</A></h3>

The cyclotron is the earliest type of atom smasher which uses the combination
of a magnetic field to confine the (usually) protons and an RF field to
accelerate them.  It was invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1930.  In a
cyclotron, both the magnetic field and RF frequency are constant.  A charged
particle traveling perpendicular to the magnetic field lines will follow a
circular trajectory with the diameter determined by its energy (speed).  For
velocities much less than the speed of light, the period of each orbit and
thus the frequency of rotation is a constant.  So, if a little boost if given
to the particles as they circle in the magnetic field, their energy will
increase along with the orbit diameter.
<p>
Cyclotrons can be of a wide range of sizes.  Lawrence's original
invention was only about 5 inches so ours at least was larger than
that!  The upper limit on size is imposed by relativity.  Once the
energy of the particles approaches their rest mass (from
E=mc<sup>2</sup> or equivalently, their speed approaches the speed of
light, the constant magnetic field/RF frequency behavior doesn't work
anymore and they would lose synchronism with the RF.  I've seen a
cyclotron with magnet pole pieces about 2 meters in diameter but even
this is probably pushing things.  There were atom smashers called
"syncro-cyclotrons" which were physically similar but varied the RF
frequency as the particles spiraled outward to maintain synchronism.
Nowadays, the modern versions are mostly "synchrotrons" which do away
with all but the outer ring and may be miles in diameter producing
energies of 100s of Giga electron-volts (GEV).  The "Super Conducting
Super Collider" was supposed to be over 20 miles in diameter (perhaps
more, I forget) but that died when BIG science fell out of favor in
Congress.  The largest one was at Betavia, IL for awhile but that has
probably been surpassed by something at CERN in Europe by now.

<h3><A NAME="concycf">The CHS Cyclotron Facility</A></h3>

I wish I could have been involved in the original construction of this
thing, but my tenure at Central had more to do with what might be
termed a major rework and upgrade.  The details of how a public high
school ended up with an atom smasher may forever remain a mystery but
what is known is that the original version was cobbled together by
students in the years prior to my high school days.
The main mover and shaker was probably Donald, who if I recall
correctly wrote a paper of sorts on "The effects of High Energy
Protons on Semiconductors" - he stuck transistors with their covers
removed inside the cyclotron and measured some combination of
parameters and how they changed with exposure to high energy protons.
Now, this was most likely totally bogus for reasons that will be come
clear below, but I think it did win him a National Merit Scholarship.
<p>
The Cyclotron Room was on the main corridor in the school basement just around
the corner from the Bookstore and opposite one of the storage areas for those
Nuclear fallout rations the Government was so fond of stockpiling around
the country (I think the mice benefitted mostly).  This was sort of fitting
and I suppose there were some teachers who wouldn't rule out a nuclear
accident from our activities!  We shared the approximately 15 x 20 foot room
with one of two huge water chillers for the school. (I never did quite figure
out if these were for the fountains or something else.)  However, the 5 gallon
container of refrigeration oil left by HVAC techs next to the chiller came in
handy from time-to-time.
<p>
The power supplies, RF source, and instrumentation were mounted in a 6 foot
and 3 foot rack.  The magnet with the vacuum chamber was behind it with the
vacuum system underneath.  The "instrumentation" was a microamp meter for
measuring beam current later upgraded to one with a tube based preamp.
We had a collection of probably non-functional radiation meters most likely
"liberated" from that storage room across the hall.  There may have also been
an actual working Geiger counter as well.  Our test equipment consisted of a
very abused Triplet 1K ohm/volt VOM with a bent needle, having been unwound
from the right-hand stop more than once.
<p>
<b>The magnet:</b>
<p>
This was a HUGE 7 inch resistive (hey, no one knew about superconducting
magnets in those days) magnet wound with a lot of #20 wire.  (Once, we found
the coil with an open connection - possibly cut by a saboteur!  Maybe that
Gary fellow I mentioned - really never found out.  Or, it may have just been
a natural failure.  Needless to say, there was a minor panic until the break
was found!).  The magnet was on a 99 year lease for $1 from some company,
maybe GE, like they'd ever want it back!  I don't know how they got it into
the place, in pieces I guess.
<p>
The magnet was horizontal.  To install or remove the vacuum chamber required
unscrewing some huge bolts and then prying apart the yoke.  Now, keep in mind
that this thing weighed in at about 6 tons even though it is a rather small
magnet.  So, replacing anything inside the vacuum chamber was always an
interesting exercise.  Underneath was a very fragile glass diffusion pump
that somehow survived.
<p>
Originally, power for the magnet came from a 200 VDC or so power supply.  We
eventually concluded that this was grossly underpowered (another reason to
suspect the cyclotron never really worked until the prior management) so we
changed it to the 2,400 VDC electric utility pole transformer based power
supply that was originally used for the RF source (mercury vapor rectifiers
and all that).  It was controlled by a BIG Variac.  With this improvement,
it probably was running near the 20,000 (2 Tesla) limit of an iron core
magnet.  It was quite impossible to extract any ferrous/magnetic objects
from between the pole pieces with the magnet fully energized. 
<p>
<b>The vacuum system:</b>
<p>
We had a Sargent-Welch rotary vane mechanical pump, maybe a 1405 but could have
been the "economy version", and an all-glass (except for the tower and
heater) oil diffusion pump.  The Welch usually needed to be started
by hand as do many of these older pumps.  Belt guard, what's a belt guard? :)
There must have been a box fan or something to cool the diffusion pump since
it did not use tap water.  The diffusion pump was about 3 inches in diameter
with a glass O-ring flange-flange reducer for the 1 inch coupling to the
vacuum chamber squashed between the magnet pole-piece right above it.  There
were no baffles, cold traps, or dryers.
<p>
An ion gauge provided our only real indication of vacuum level other than that
wonderful clacking sound the mechanical pump made when it has drawn down below
10 microns or so.  We had the obligatory hand-held Tesla ('Oudin') coil for
leak testing though it was used much more often to chase the unwanted visitors
from the cyclotron room. :)  Anyhow, once the whole affair was drenched in Red
Glyptal, leaks really weren't an issue!
<p>
I seem to recall a scavenged thermocouple gauge as well but that may have been
for the "Linear Time-of-Flight Resonance Mass Spectrometer" I started to build.
That at least got me a free cruise on a Navy destroyer escort and my first
plane flight to the Newport Navy Base as a consolation price at the local
science fair since it was not completed and never really worked - but the
charts and front panel were impressive!  I still have the Science Fair
posters.  Oops, that's another story.....
<p>
The vacuum system would do at least 10<sup>-6</sup> Torr when it was
cooperating.  Usually, it didn't take long to get there but since we really
didn't trust the ion gauge all that much, we usually left the thing running
overnight.  (The actual pump-down time was probably measured in a very small
number of minutes.)  But, the ion gauge tube was never damaged from loss of
vacuum. :)  The controller might have been a Varian RG-31X, a semi-antique
even at that time.
<p>
<b>The vacuum chamber:</b>
<p>
For our huge 7 inch magnet, we needed a vacuum chamber large enough for the
Ds (the electrodes that actually accelerate the protons - shaped like the
letter 'D') and a little clearance.  In all, it was about 12 inches in
diameter and two inches thick.  The 'D's (actually only one, see below) was
mounted on a metal stud fixed in Epoxy passing through a glass insulator.
<p>
Most cyclotrons have a pair of 'D's and drive them with a balanced RF source.
Someone decided that this wasn't necessary, so ours had a single brass 'D'
made of sheet metal brazed at the edges with the RF between it and the ground
of the vacuum chamber.  In principle, this would work though I suspect there
would be less of a focusing effect.  What did we know?  I seem to recall
later replacing the single 'D' with a pair made from machined aluminum.
<p>
<b>The RF source:</b>
<p>
Originally, a 200 W amplifier driven by a 50 W exciter generated the RF (about
20 MHz if I recall correctly) for the 'Ds'.  This was based on a pair of
811 tubes (remember those?). I later built a 1 kW linear amp (from the AARL
Handbook) using an EIMAC 3-400Z or something like that.  The original power
supply (866 mercury rectifier tube based) was moved to the magnet and a new
solid state HV power supply was built for the amp.

<h3><A NAME="concycr">True R and D</A></h3>

I consider the years I spent working on that machine to be more closely akin
to true scientific research than anything since - designing giga instruction
per second high performance 3-D visualization/graphics accelerators or
microchip lasers just doesn't have the same feel!
<p>
I had to learn - on my own - about high vacuum technology, high power (well,
relatively speaking) RF, instrumentation, at least a little E/M and high
energy physics, and much more.  Keep in mind that no one else - including any
of the teachers at Central High - had a clue about ANY of this!  I'm sure
they thought we were building a bomb...
<p>
I also learned a lot about locksmithing (including all about making master
keys using solder-fills and lock picking) - one has to be resourceful to
succeed in these endeavors.  The teachers were aware of this and kind of
accepted it (as well as benefitting at times), realizing the limitations
of an environment where advanced science was more along the lines of
dissecting a worm. :)
<p>
To be continued as I think of more tid-bits...

<h3><A NAME="concyco">Other Home-Built Cyclotrons</A></h3>

I don't know how many of these were successfully constructed prior to the CHS
Cyclotron in the early 1960s.  However, there have been several, if not many,
built since then both by individuals and as projects in various high schools
and colleges.  Check out the following links:

Some brief references to our cyclotron may even be found by a determined
Web search (at least one in the bio of a person who recalls having been
involved).  I welcome any info or links to the CHS Cyclotron or any other
home-built cycltrons that have existed.

<h3><A NAME="concycg">The First Generation Central High School Cyclotron</A></h3>

I recently heard from one of the original builders of the Central High School
Cyclotron, Lawrence H. Zuckerman, Pleasanton CA,
(Email: (<A HREF="mailto:K3LZ@aol.com">K3LZ@aol.com</A>),
who was in the 218th class.  Here is a paraphrase of our email
thread:
<p>
(From: Larry.)
<p>
I graduated with the 218th class of Central High School.  I was a member  
of the Cyclotron Society and helped to build this accelerator when I was a
freshman in the '58-'59 school year.  When we completed construction and
performed a brief test, our work was publicized by the Heart Association,
and a newspaper article with pictures of us appeared all over the country.
<p>
I remember guys who were much older than me -- had just graduated in the
210th class and started college, such as Nathaniel Ostroff and Joshua 
Horowitz.  I may think of other names later.   
<p>
Our faculty advisor was an MIT-educated physicist and later School  
District of Philadelphia science curriculum executive, was Fred Hofkin.  
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Hi:
<p>
Hey, wow!  You're the first person from the original construction team 
I've ever heard from.  I have seen a few Web references to other "personal"
cyclotron projects, but nothing  about Central until what I wrote.
<p>
We were involved from '66 to '69 or '70.
<p>
Anything you can  add or correct would be most appreciated, with whatever
attribution you'd like!
<p>
(From: Larry.)
<p>
It was Hofkin who told us that the cyclotron really only needed one Dee.
I did not know any physics then and never thought about it all these years.  
Now that I am thinking about it, the single Dee architecture worries me.  
<p>
You mentioned that the magnet assembly is there on a 99 year lease.  I  
vaguely remember that fact, and also that the "lessor" is the University  
of Pennsylvania, where I went to study Physics starting in 9/62.  
<p>
One of my tasks, assigned to me by Hofkin, was to determine the number of  
turns on the magnet (so that, using the current value, the field density 
and deflection could be calculated).  I recollect (maybe incorrectly) that  
there were four coils, two slightly dis-similar pairs.  He said I could  
use any method I wished, except for unwinding it. ;-)  I measured the wire
gauge to determine ohms/thousand feet.  I measured the resistance of each
coil.  The total of 72,800 turns rings a bell, (but  that was 50 years ago!).
<p>
My other task was to build the control panel, which was nothing more than a
relay rack panel with switches, chassis, and 120 Volt AC connectors.  I did
that OK, except giving the older boys a laugh by using bell wire; so Nat
re-wired it with #18 zip/lamp cord, using both conductors in parallel.
<p>
The cyclotron calculations (which I certainly did not do at the time) said 
that the frequency needed for the Dee was about 7 MHz.  You mentioned  a  
small ham rig for that, which could have been a DX-20.  I don't remember  
the power  amplifier.  
<p>
We fired up the equipment, opened it, and found a mark on the side in a 
plausible location.  Was it from a proton beam?  I think it was too far
from the Dee to be an RF arc.
<p>
The main (second stage oil diffusion)  vacuum pump was donated to us by  
EIMAC (Eitel-McCullough), a fact  mentioned in the AP/UPI released 
newspaper article that had the picture of the six of us standing around the  
cyclotron.  I think this happened late in the school year.  
<p>
I shall check with the CHS Associated Alumni (of which I am a member)  to  
get more information.  If the cyclotron is still there, I  would like to 
see it the next time I visit Philadelphia, which is once or twice a year.  I have 
also been looking for information about Fred Hofkin.  
<p>
As a bit of irony, for the past fifteen years, I have been living about 10 
miles from the (E. O.) Lawrence Livermore Labs.  I am an RF design 
engineer at  NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR.
<p>
If I think of anything else or obtain more documentation,  I'll send it to  
you.  Nice work on your web site!
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p> 
Thanks for the info.  
<p>
Using the same basic calculations as you did, we concluded that the
magnet was way underpowered by the original power supply and moved it
over to the rectified pig-pole transformer supply.
<p>
Hmmmm, let's see.  Assuming a mean diameter of 2 feet and #20 AWG wire, your
72,800 turns is about 450,000 feet with 10 ohms/thousand feet for
#20 AWG wire, that would be roughly 4,500 ohms.  I seem to recall
we measured 6,000 ohms, so not too far off. :)
<p>
I built a 1 kW linear amp from the AARL handbook that was then driven by
the DX-20 exciter.  It replaced what was a home-built RF amp, supposedly
about 200 W.
<p>
That calculation of 7 MHz may have been correct for the weaker magnet,
though I think it was even weaker than that.  I seem to recall we 
eventually ran it on 1 or 2 kV, rather than the 200 V it was on
originally.  I'm not sure what the RF frequency we were running
at, perhaps 20 MHz for a (20 kgauss) saturated iron magnet.
But our only means of measuring field strength was by the student
and hammer method - how many average CHS students it took to pull
our standard hammer from the core when the magnet was energized! :)
<p>
The single Dee thing always bothered me also, but I seem to recall other
references to it, so perhaps it's not totally bogus, though probably less
efficient.
<p>
As far as whether it ever worked, I rather doubt any real proton beam
from this machine would have had enough power to make a mark but who
knows.  We finally got it to expose a piece of dental X-ray film,
and that was marginal.
<p>
The most dodgy thing was probably the ion source due to its simplicity,
had to be operated on the border between high vacuum and a pressure too
high to sustain a beam.
<p>
And I'm still amazed that the glass diffusion pump survived!  :)
<p>
As far as to whether the thing is still there, I have no idea.  But
who would want to move a 6 ton magnet!
<p>
Anything else you come up  with will be  welcome.
<p>
(From: Larry.)
<p> 
It is great that you guys resumed work on the cyclotron after my days at  
CHS and did so much; I knew nothing about this.  Following my freshman  year, 
I built much amateur radio transmitting and receiving equipment while  in 
high school, but I have no recollection that anyone ever went back into the  
cyclotron room. 
<p> 
I imagine you are correct that any proton beam from this machine could not  
make a visible mark.  
<p> 
If the cyclotron was ever cleared out, it was probably to make room for a 
girls' lavatory!
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Or to add another water chiller. :)
<p>
I think we were actually the third generation.  Between your team and ours,
there was Donald and several others.
