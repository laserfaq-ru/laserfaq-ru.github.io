<h2>Introduction</h2>

This chapter contains information on specific models of commercial solid
state lasers.  The first portion is for lamp pumped solid state lasers
while the remainder (and bulk) is for diode pumped solid state lasers.
This skewed coverage reflects both my relative experience as well as
their increasing popularity and importance.  The next chapter has
maintenance and repair information for both types.

<h2>Florod LCP Laser Trimming System</h2>

This is a pulsed doubled Nd:YAG laser system (532 nm) designed for trimming of
semiconductors (e.g., blasting holes in on-chip resistors, zener diodes,
etc.).  The LCP consists of a laser head which attaches to a microscope
(mounted on a semiconductor probe station) and has a mount for a CCD camera.
Photos of the laser head and power supply can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under "Florod YAG
Lasers".
<p>
The laser head consists of the flashlamp and YAG rod in a sealed box, the
KTP doubling crystal (outside the cavity), servo controlled apertures
(variable slits) for X and Y spot size, and a servo controlled attenuator
to adjust pulse energy.  Note that this attenuator approach is much simpler
and more consistent than alternatives using adjustable capacitor voltage or
pulse duration control.
<p>
The YAG rod is probably about 50 mm long by 3 or 4 mm in diameter, AR coated
both ends.  The mirrors are glued to the cavity box with the end plates
being on split washers to do the alignment. (At first I thought they were
non-adjustable, until I attempted to disassemble it!)  The
servos are the types used for RC models but work fine in this application. :)
Optics are glued to precision X-Y adjustable mounts.  A fiber optic light
pipe cable introduces a targeting beam for viewing the dimensions of the
laser spot into the light path via a 45 degree dichroic mirror which is
transparent to the laser beam but reflects an adequate portion of the
white light beam.
<p>
Energy into the flashlamp is about 28 joules (66 uF at 850 V provided by
three 200 uF, 330 V photoflash capacitors in series).  Triggering is via
an SCR and EG&G trigger transformer to an external electrode on the flashlamp.
I don't know what the exact maximum output energy is but for this application,
but less than a mJ is adequate once the beam is focused to a spot of a few um.
<p>
Output energy per pulse is adjusted by rotating the polarization of the
green beam with respect to a fixed polarizer, rather than by controlling
the energy storage capacitor voltage or actual energy into the flashlamp.  A
half waveplate in the green beam is physically rotated by a servo based
on the setting of a knob on the front panel.
<p>
The optics chain consists of:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fully enclosed (but probably not very well sealed) air-cooled YAG laser
 cavity.
<li>Bounce mirror 1 on adjustable mount.
<li>Bounce mirror 2 on adjustable mount.
<li>KTP doubler crystal.
<li>Half waveplate on servo-controller rotator.
<li>IR-blocking filter.
<li>Glan-Thompson-type polarizing prism (works with half waveplate to
 adjust beam energy).
<li>Beam combiner for 532 nm laser and halogen aiming beam (45 degree dichroic
 plate).
<li>X-axis servo-controlled aperture adjuster.
<li>Y-axis servo-controlled aperture adjuster.
<li>Bounce mirror 3 on adjustable mount.
<li>Bounce mirror 4 on adjustable mount.
<li>Collimating/focusing lens assembly.
<li>Beam combiner for CCD camera port (45 degree dichroic plate).
<li>External microscope objective to focus laser beam to chip or wafer
 or MEMS or whatever.
</ul>
<p>
The optical path is a loop - the laser shoots down but the two pairs of bounce
mirrors turn the beam around twice by 180 degrees.  The primary benefit
of this arrangement is that the laser head can be about half as long
compared to one that was linear.  The four folding mirrors do provide
additional degrees of freedom to adjust alignment into the microscope
objective, but this also makes alignment quite counter-intuitive.
And, the slow pulsed laser (maximum rate of 1 pulse per second)
doesn't make this any easier!  An sensitive averaging thermal or
pyroelectric laser power/energy meter with a small probe that can
be placed at various locations within the optics chain is essential.
Doing it by eye would not be fun!
<p>
The controller consists of analog knobs for X and Y aperture and laser power
(operating those RC servos, all with digital readout, presumably simply
of voltage on the pots), single shot or 1 pulse/second select, and a knob
for the targeting light source brightness via a phase control dimmer.
Nothing is particularly high tech, but does seem reliable!
There are a bunch of trimpots on the hand-wired logic board (!!), probably
to adjust the servo limits and maybe set the repetition rate.  I don't
believe there is any regulation of the laser energy or even flashlamp
voltage.
<p>
Although the output of the YAG rod is clearly dangerous (it is probably
10 mJ or more) and the final green output may even be hazardous to vision, the
system has a Class I rating (unconditionally safe) because everything is
fully enclosed under normal operation, it's essentially impossible to
place one's eyeball at the output when said eyeball is in its
normal location. :)  And with the usual delivery via a microscope
objective, the beam is very widely diverging at that point and
essentially harmless even if reflected from a mirrored surface.
There are two sets of head interlocks (which can be bypassed for
servicing via jumper plugs): A magnet on the cover and dual reed
switches detects cover removal, and
a tilt sensor detects if the laser head is not vertical to within 20 or
30 degrees.  These are in series with the master interlock connector
at the back of the controller and any one of them disables
primary power to the high voltage transformer.  (The rest of
the system continues to function).  The firing logic requires a
momentary SPDT switch to close one circuit and open the other
within a short time.  For manual operation, this would generally
be a footswitch, but could be from a computer controlled relay,
or possibly direct from TTL levels.

<h2>Hughes Rangefinder Ruby Laser Assembly</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sclhrld">Description and Specifications</A></h3>

This pulsed ruby laser was used as part of the time-of-flight rangefinder
in the M-60 battle tank to determine target distance.  The official
designation is apparently "AN/VVG-2 Rangefinder, Fire Control" or
"AN/VVG-2 Laser Rangefinder (LRF)" should you care.  (The photomultiplier
based return sensor and computation unit that go 
ith it rarely, if ever, appear surplus.  At least I haven't seen them.)  A
typical sample of this unit is shown in <A HREF="hrl1.jpg">Hughes Ruby Laser
Assembly with Parts Labeled</A> [photo provided courtesy of Dave
(Ws407c@aol.com)].  Some versions of this laser obtained surplus may differ
slightly, lacking the collimator, for example.  Additional photos, description,
and comments on the ruby laser assembly and various home-built power supplies
may be found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
under: "Hughes Rangefinder and Home-Built Ruby Lasers".  Complete power supply
schematics are provided in the section:
<A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscwe1">Wes's Ruby Laser Power Supply (WE-SP1)</A>.
Adjustment information can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strhrl">Aligning the Hughes Ruby Laser</A>.
<p>
The following specifications have been confirmed by Chris Chagaris
(pyro@grolen.com) and amended by Dr. Ed Edmondson (EE0035jr@aol.com).
However, there could be other variations with slightly
different part values so double checking what you have would not be a bad
idea!  And, of course, if you replace the PFN with one of higher energy,
the values for output pulse energy will be greater (unless the flashlamp
explodes).  (Refer to
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserpic/hbl1pics.htm#hrf">Photos of
Hughes Range Finder and Home-Built Pulsed Lasers</A>.)
<p>
Where "test data" is listed, it's for a sample of this unit I have
which included a test data sheet.
<p>
<ul>
<li>General: This is the ruby laser assembly from what is generally called the 
 "M-60 Tank Rangefinder." The AN numbers are AN/ V V S -1, -2, and -3. I 
 looked this AN number up and the description is "V" Ground Vehicle, "V" 
 Visual, Visible Light, "S" Range detecting and bearing equipment. The dash
 "-" is the version of the model.
<p>
 These AN/ Numbers are related to the following equipment. AN/VVS-1 is used on 
 the M60A2 Tank, AN/VVS-2 is used on the M60A3 Tank, and the AN/VVS-3 is used
 on the M1 Tank.  (Note: Only the AN/VVS-1 is definitely a laser rangefinder.
 The AN/VVS-2 seems to be a night vision system.  I do not know about the
 AN/VVS-3.  --- Sam.)
<p>
 The major contracting firm even made a version designated LAV-105 (Light 
 Assault Vehicle) which was used on a US Marine APC's (Armoured Personel 
 Carrier).
<p>
 These laser rangefinders were replaced with eye-safe versions using
 erbium:glass at 1,540 nm and YAG-KTP-OPO at 1,580 nm. This older non-eye-safe
 version of this assembly is being sold on the Internet by several 
 different surplus companies and individuals on eBay and elsewhere.
<p>
<li>Output wavelength: 694.3 mm.  Ruby is actually listed as having two
 output wavelengths. The R1 line at 694.3 and the R2 line at 692.9. Laser
 action will only take place at the R1 line which will reach threshold before
 the R2 line.  Threshold of the R2 line will never take place once the R1 line
 begins to 'lase'.
<p>
<li>Output pulse energy: The test spec is 50 mJ using the original PFN.
 However, this is typically reached far below the maximum spec'd voltage
 of 1,250 VDC on the PFN.  the maximum output energy could indeed be a
 bit higher than this at the maximum input energy of around 125 joules.
<p>
 Test data: 50 mJ at a PFN voltage of 1,095 VDC.
<p>
<li>Output pulse power: 1 MW minimum.
<p>
 Test data: 1.4 mW based on 50 mJ pulse energy divided by 35 ns pulse
 duration.
<p>
<li>Lasing medium: Synthetic ruby rod, 1/4" x 3".  Rod ends are polished and
 AR coated.  The common dopant being Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 0.05% by
 weight.
<p>
<li>Pump source: Linear xenon flashlamp EG&G model FX-103C-3 or its
 replacement FXQ-1302-3.  Here are the specifications for the FXQ-1302-3:
<p> 
 <ul>
 <li>Bore diameter (ID): 0.157 inches/4 mm.
 <li>Arc length: 3 inches/76 mm.
 <li>Total length: 5.56 inches/141.2 mm.
 <li>Ko impedance parameter: 24.3 ohms-amp<sup>0.5</sup>.
 <li>Minimum flashing voltage: 600 VDC.
 <li>Maximum average power 150 W (convection cooled), 300 W (forced air).
 <li>Minimum trigger voltage: 12 KV (series), 15 KV (external).
 <li>Explosion energy: 360 J (100 us), 1,170 J (1 ms).
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Cavity: Highly reflective, semi-elliptical cavity.  The rod is
 conformally clamped in place over its entire lower providing for
 effective conduction cooling.  The flashlamp is held only by
 its ends and is not quite in contact with the cavity so cooling is
 mostly via convection.
<p>
 The top part of the cavity reflector may be taken off by removing the one
 obvious screw and carefully wiggling the cover loose (if necessary).  Take
 care not to smash the flashlamp in the process.  DO NOT TOUCH any of the
 interior surfaces, especially of the flashlamp!  Fingerprint oil may
 cause it to explode after a few flashes (so they say).  The flashlamp
 does not actually touch any part of the reflector assembly but mounts
 via its end-caps into a grounded block at the cathode-end and an insulated
 nylon block at the anode-end  The rod is clamped in place in the bottom
 part of the cavity reflector, possibly cushioned by a layer of indium
 or other soft heat conductive material.
<p>
<li>Q-switch: Rotating prism driven at 30,000 rpm by PM motor.  A magnetic
 pickup on the motor shaft supplies trigger signal for flashlamp (via SCR in
 pulse forming network).  (Note that what looks like a second trigger point
 on the rotating shaft is only a counter-balance and is non-magnetic.)  An
 adjustable monostable should be added to permit convenient adjustment of
 precise pulse delay but see the Q-switch comments, below.
<p>
<li>Q-switch motor: Made by Hathaway Corporation, MI Division in Tulsa,
 Oklahoma.  Manufacturer code 16127. Part Number is still active (available)
 and is number 9971116. Rated Voltage of 20 VDC, Speed at rated voltage is
 36,000 RPM +/- 10%. Current at rated voltage is 0.88 A. The p-p ripple
 current (A) is 1.75. Speed variation (RPM) of 500 Max.
<p>
 In normal operation, the motor is spun up on demand just prior to the
 laser firing.  It would be a good idea to implement this feature in any
 home-built power supply designs to prolong the life of the motor.
<p>
 Test data: Spinup time at normal operating voltage (?) should be less than
 200 ms, 40 ms typical, 70 ms on this unit.
<p>
<li>High Reflector (HR) mirror: Fixed roof prism.  Since this is not a corner
 cube, alignment is still critical in the horizontal axis.
<p>
<li>Output Coupler (OC) mirror: Resonant optic.  Note: Replacing this with a
 dielectric mirror coated for 694.3 nm may result in a much lower threshold
 without Q-switching.  However, this original OC can be used for successful
 laser operation without the Q-switch. In a straight in-line configuration
 (HR:ROD:OC), threshold can be reached at approximately 75 joules of input
 power to the lamp.
<p>
<li>Collimator: Some versions include an AR coated output collimator/beam
 expander telescope.  The optics are sealed with glue so it's not really
 possible to disassemble for cleaning (or at least not easy).
<p>
<li>Pulse forming network: Oil filled (non-PCB) 150 to 160 uF energy storage
 capacitor and SCR-fired trigger circuit.
<p>
<li>Flashlamp supply voltage: +800 to +1,300 VDC for energy storage capacitor.
<p>
 The spec'd maximum voltage is 1,250 VDC and the operating voltage (50 mJ
 output energy) on the test data was 1,095 VDC.
<p>
<li>Trigger supply voltage: +160 to +200 VDC for trigger circuit SCR capacitor
 and +3 VDC for SCR trigger input.
<p>
<li>Thermistor: Identified by the nomenclature RT1. The resistance at 25 &deg;C
 is approximately 100K ohms.
<p>
<li>Interface Connector: 11 pin Mil-style green male connector numbered 1 to
 11 with pin 1 being the right most pin. Pins 1 and 2 are a no connect, pins
 3 and 4 are thermistor, pins 5 and 6 are for the hall effect sensor (Pin 5 is 
 black wire and Pin 6 white wire), pin 7 is a no connect, pins 8 and 9 go to 
 the motor (pin 8 red wire and pin 9 black wire), and pins 10 and 11 are also 
 no connect.
<p>
<li>Manufacturer(s): At the moment there is a problem determining which of the 
 following Contractor(s) actually made this product for the US Military 
 (basically for  the US Army Battle Tanks): Hughes Electro-Optic Systems 
 (purchased by Raytheon), Kollsman Inc., or Litton Electro-Optical Systems
 (LEOS) owned by Northrop Grumman Corp.
<p>
<li>Mil markings: 19200, ASSY 105559447, MFR 89944, ASSY 10559479. RT1 for 
 thermistor, U1 for the hall effect switch is marked 11738993, B1 Q-switch 
 motor, Output Coupler (OC) assembly is marked with 10559461, bottom of the 
 laser cavity marked with 29200, and a serial number (S/N), under the laser 
 cavity is a marking 10559442, the rod is marked 071E (probably the S/N), the 
 aluminum cathode support and contact is marked 10559471, The anode insulator

<h3><A NAME="sclhrlq">Notes on the Hughes Q-Switch</A></h3>

According the test sheet that came with the sample of the
M-60 laser head I have, the Q-switch motor is spun up prior to each
shot only until the laser fires and is then shut down.  None of the
designs I've seen (including all those presently in the
chepter: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#ssctoc">Complete SS Laser Power Supply
Schematics</A>) do this.  But, for maximum life, it's probably a good
idea.  You do expect to get 100,000 shots from this thing, correct? :)
The specification calls for a spinup time of no more than 200 ms, with
40 ms being typical, but it doesn't list the motor voltage.
<p>
With the long fluorescence lifetime of ruby - about 3 ms - timing of the
Q-switch is not as critical as it is for Nd:YAG with its much shorter
fluorescence lifetime (230 us).  The Q-switch motor spins at 30,000
rpm or 500 rps for a period of 2 ms.  So, if the flash duration is
resaonably short compared to 2 ms, there will be a high probability of
a decent output energy even if the flashlamp was triggered at random
relative to the Q-switch position!  Even if the flash duration is as
long as 3 ms, half the time, more than 50 percent of the available
energy will have been transferred to the rod when the Q-switch is
triggered.  This is probably the main reason that faulty Q-switch
trigger circuits seemed to produce successful results, though I bet
the variation in energy due to the timing not always being optimal
remained a mystery and was probably attributed to other causes.
However, with a proper design, the pulse energy should be quite
consistent.
<p>
(From: Doug Little (dmlittle@btinternet.com).)
<p>
The pulse generated by the Q-switch's magnetic pickup looks a little like this:
<p>
<pre>
            /\
        ___/  \    ___
               \  /
                \/
</pre>
<p>
If you build your trigger circuit carefully and make sure you connect the
magnetic pickup the right way around (rising or falling edge) you can
minimize any unwanted delay between pickup and trigger. You can then of
course introduce an artificial and adjustable delay of your own for
optimization purposes.  A suitable circuit is shown in
<A HREF="dlst1sch.gif">Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes MS-60 Ruby
Laser</A> and described in the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscdl1">Doug's
Q-Switch Triggering Circuit for Hughes MS-60 Ruby Laser (DL-ST1)</A>.
<p>
There are some important things to realize when you try to set up your own
timing circuit:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The pickup produces a weak signal (I don't remember the value, but it's
 only about 2 or 3 volts). You won't be able to drive a standard Schmitt
 trigger directly with it, so a transistor or other amplifier may be needed.
 I used a BC547 transistor with a resistor and it worked great. You could use
 an op-amp, but that might just be overkill.
<p>
<li>The pickup is timed precisely to trigger the flashlamp without any
 artificially introduced delay. This severely limits your ability to tune
 timing in both directions. All you can do is increase the time between
 detect & fire - you can't decrease it.
</ol>
<p>
There are two ways around the second problem. One is to run the motor
backwards, giving you a whole rotational period of about 2 ms to play with.
Being a mechanical motor, this is a lot of time to wait before discharging
the lamp without expecting some sort of speed fluctuation. The longer the
delay, the less accurate the prism's final (flash) position becomes in terms
of motor speed!!! I have strobed the prism with a super-bright LED using a
very short on-time of several us and I can say that a 2 ms delay results in a
slightly wobbly prism, instead of a preferred rock-solid one. The second
solution involves the motor/Q-switch mounting platform. If you loosen the
hex bolts you can rotate the whole unit about 5 to 10 degrees in either
direction.  This affects timing quite a bit and gives you the opportunity to
buy back a few 10s of us.
<p>
WARNING! Adjusting the Q-switch platform may kill your laser's alignment and
you will have to go through the whole horrible process of adjusting the
optics with a reference laser and it can take hours. I know because I did it
myself. If your laser is already aligned, you may want to think <b>very</b>
hard before you go adjusting those hex bolts!
<p>
(From: Randy Smith (randysmith@adelphia.net).)
<p>
I too have one of these ruby laser units that I am trying to get running. To
start off with, there needed to be some sort of timing control unit to
synchronize the flashlamp with the spinning mirror. I built such a device
using an 87C552 micro, with a 4 digit thumb switch control to allow for an
arbitrary offset from TDC (top dead center), entered in degrees. The jury is
still out as to the functionality of this unit, but it does look good on a
scope and also, when used to drive a small laser diode, it can be used to view
the instantaneous position of the mirror. I will find out for sure this coming
weekend, when I test it in operation with the laser.
<p>
(From: John Grebas (kerravon@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
The original PFN produces a 250 us pulse.  If the lamp is fired immediately
when the magnetic sensor picks up the pulse,
approximately 300 us later you will have a beam.  You have to have the
motor running forward (red motor wire on positive) and the speed set so the
period of the magnetic pickup is 1.6 ms.
<p>
But I also used a bank of 12, 470 uF, 400 V caps, and a 200 mH inductor, at
979 V to get a 1 ms pulse.  I run the motor in reverse with a period of 2.5 ms,
I delayed the magnetic pickup pulse by 1.5 ms (between 1.4 ms and 1.5 ms).
So with the motor running in reverse with a 2.5 ms period between pulses and
a 1 ms pulse from the PFN, and a 1.5 ms delay, you will get your beam (2.5 ms =
1 ms + 1.5 ms). If you follow that you should be OK.  So I could run my
motor (backward) with a 2 ms period, with my 1 ms pulse I would set the
delay to 1 ms (2 ms = 1 ms + 1 ms).  Basically your delay + your PFN's pulse
time should equal the period of the pulses from the magnetic pickup (controlled
by the speed of the motor.  Say you have a 700 us pulse from the PFN you could
run the motor with a 2 ms period with the 800 us pulse, you would set your
delay to 1.2 ms.

<h3><A NAME="sclhrlc">Comments on the Hughes Ruby Laser</A></h3>

(From: Paul (sinebar@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
I finally got the thing to work but I had to step up the power input to
the flash lamp.  I simply added a second 150 uf cap in parallel with the
other to get a total input of about 216 joules.  I charged both up to 1,200
volts.  I used the Doug Little's <A HREF="dlst1sch.gif">Q-Switch Trigger
Circuit for Hughes MS-60 Ruby Laser</A> to synchronize the flash
lamp discharge with the Q-switch (See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclhrlq">Notes on the Hughes Q-Switch</A>.  I ran the
motor CCW at 36,000 RPM and adjusted the Q-switch prism to be about 1/8th turn
past the pickup when the lamp fires.  This seems to give the best results.
It blows the ink off a page.  Next, I'ms going to see what it will do metal. :)
<p>
I figure that with only the original 150 uF or so cap producing at most 126
joules, at 1,300 volts max, it is probably just barely at the lasing threshold
with an optimally timed and aligned Q-switch.   The military techs had a
device for this unit that tuned the Q-switch without firing the flash lamp.
If one had that device then you could probably get it to work with just one
cap. Also if it had a real OC instead of just a clear optical medium I
think that would help a lot.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, we know that the use of a dielectric OC reduces the lasing threshold
significantly.  Wes Ellison actually got the laser operating <i>without</i>
the Q-switch using an OC from some other ruby laser.

<h3><A NAME="sclccro">Comments and Caution About the Resonant OC</A></h3>

The resonant OC in the Hughes ruby laser consists of two thick plates separated
by a thicker spacer which is hollow in the center so that in effect, the
outer plates are air-spaced.  It's likely that the coefficient of thermal
expansion of the plates and spacer have been carefully selected to make
the response temperature invariant, or at least that all of the peaks of
the optic move by the same amount with temperature changes.  All four
surfaces appear to be uncoated and thus have similar reflectivity.  The
plates and spacer are held in place by a rubber O-ring but the
interface between them is either optically contacted or at least ground
and polished as it is optically clear.  I do not know if removing the
retaining ring (which would be difficult since it is fixed with adhesive
locking compound) or end plate (4 screws) simply allows the entire etalon
assembly to be removed intact, or whether the entire thing falls apart. :(
<p>
The problem with the resonant optic is that there is no way of knowing
if it is any good by inspection or by any easy tests.  The location of
the reflective wavelength peaks depend on the spacings of the surfaces in
a multiple plate etalon.  For these low reflectivity surfaces, the
response function results in very broad peaks and multiple peaks will
fit within the gain bandwidth of ruby so they don't have to be positioned
precisely as long as they match.  The thickness of the two plates is what
determines the peak location for them and they are presumably matched.
However, reflections between the plates with a distance determined by the
spacer will also affect the overall response.  It is not known (though could be
calculated) what the exact effect will be.  If someone (before you of course!)
was curious and disassembled it, even if all the parts were put back together
in the correct order, some change in performance is possible, though it's not
known how serious this is likely to be.  But, even a speck of dust trapped
between one of the plates and the spacer could be significant when dealing
with wavelengths of light.  Given the general difficulty in
getting this laser working with the resonant OC at all, replacing it with
a dielectric OC with a known reflectance may be worthwhile especially if
there is any uncertainty in the resonant OC's condition.  And as noted,
this could result in a lower threshold as well.
<p>
I first tested one of these with a red laser (though not at 694.3 nm, probably
a 650 nm diode).  The reflectivities of the surfaces are consistent with
uncoated glass.  I doubt anything has degraded in storage.  For it to work
as an OC, you don't need much reflectivity, maybe 15 or 20 percent at 694.3 nm.
So, presumably, what is required is that two of the dips in the Fabry-Perot
resonance of the two plates should (coincide so the attenuation) adds and be
within the gain-bandwidth of the ruby crystal (about 0.5 nm).  I don't know
how they can guarantee that.  Perhaps the thicknesses are controllable to
the required degree.  Or, maybe the thickness of the two plates is not
quite the same so that there is a series of dips with slightly different
spacing, assuring that one set of them lines up under the ruby gain curve.
<p>
Here are some more comprehensive test results using an HP-5501A HeNe laser
tube at 632.8 nm.  The difference between 632.8 nm and 694.3 nm really
should not affect the maximum/minimum reflectivity as an etalon, only the
location of the peaks and valleys.  This tube has a built-in high quality
beam expander and is also quite stable even without being installed in the
HP-5501A laser head.  The horizontal angle of the OC was adjusted to produce
minimum and maximum readings at as close to normal incidence as possible.
<p>
The output power of the laser increased slightly as the tube warmed up.
So, these sets of measurements were taken a few minutes apart:
<p>
<PRE>
  Parameter           Test 1     Test 2     Test 3
-----------------------------------------------------
  Laser power         382 uW     409 uW     414 uW

  Minimum power (T)   221 uW     237 uW     238 uW
   Transmission %      57.8%      57.9%      57.5%
    Reflection %       42.2%      42.1%      42.5%

  Maximum power (T)   362 uW     388 uW     392 uW
    Transmission %     94.8%      94.9%      94.7%
    Reflection %        5.2%       5.1%       5.3%

  Ratio Max/Min T      1.64       1.64       1.65
  Ratio Max/Min R      8.12       8.25       8.02
</PRE>
<p>
Note: The reflection (R) values were computed from transmission data since
actually measuring the reflected beam at the small angles where the etalon
effects are significant would be almost impossible.  So, the actual reflected
power  may be slightly lower due to losses, but probably not by that much
for this low-finesse etalon.  The maximum reflection of about 42 percent
is much more than enough to function as an OC.  So, I'm not sure why some
people apparently are unable to get this to work.  Perhaps they are giving
up too easily, assuming it was a lost cause.

<h3><A NAME="sclhrli">Increasing Repetition Rate of Hughes Ruby Laser?</A></h3>

<blockquote>
"I purchased one of the Hughes rangefinders (two, actually, if I can find
 the other one...), and have been looking at what might optimize the output.
 It appears that simmer pulse operation, with 600 V square wave pulses with a
 duty cycle such that one pumps for the length of a rotational period
 without killing the tube would do the trick.  IGBTs would do the switching
 - the question is how to trigger the tube without a serial transformer in
 the existing cavity.  The best idea I have would be to use an insulated
 wire externally as the trigger - has anyone tried this and made it work?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
How exactly do you intend to "optimize the output"? I get the impression
that you wish to optimize repetition rate by utilizing a pseudo-simmer mode
circuit. You must realize that this laser was designed to operate at a low
repetition rate and must do so for a number of reasons. The original flashlamp
contained in this laser is an EG&G, FX-103C-3 which is the predecessor of
their FXQ-1302-3. With the design of this cavity employing only convection
cooling of this original lamp, the maximum average power is rated at only 20
watts. At an input energy to the lamp of let's say 100 joules (somewhat above
minimum for laser operation) your pulse repetition rate would be limited to
one pulse every five seconds. With such a slow repetition rate I cannot see
the justification for employing a simmer mode of operation.  Since there are
no active means of cooling the ruby rod, this could also present a problem, as
ruby does not dissipate heat very well and the likelihood of damage from
over-temperature is great if this system were to be operated much above its
design limitations.  With the configuration of this particular laser cavity
(semi ellipse) the use of an external trigger wire for successful firing would
be highly unlikely. The flashlamp is in intimate contact with the grounded
aluminum base of this reflector to aid in the cooling of the lamp. A wire of
any kind would interfere with this contact and of course would serve no
purpose as the current would just flow to ground. A wire with enough
insulation to protect against the very high voltage pulse (10 kV or more)
would be very impractical.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I agree with Chris 100% that boosting the repetition rate isn't really
viable.  As far as triggering, an alternative to series triggering is parallel
triggering which can easily be extended to multiple trigger sources.  See the
section: <A HREF="lasersps.htm#spsbsc">Basic Structure and Characteristics
of SS Laser Power Supplies</A>.  EG&G (now Perkin Elmer) has info on simmer
mode and much more on their Web site.  Go to
<A HREF="http://optoelectronics.perkinelmer.com/">Perkin
Elmer Optoelectronics</A> and then to "White Papers".  The title is:
"Design Considerations for Triggering of Flashlamps".
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
In more detail, there are two points to consider in answering this question:

<ol>
<li>The first and most important is calculating the damage threshold of the
 xenon flashlamp in regards to repetition rate and power input. All flashlamps
 have 'average power limitations' that are based on the type of lamp
 (glass to metal seal) and the method of cooling. Average power input is
 calculated by:
<p>
<pre>
                  P(avg) = E x f
</pre>
 Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>E = Energy in joules
 <li>f = Flash repetition rate in pulses per second.
 </ul>
<p>
 The flashlamps that one may find in the MS-60 rangefinder ruby lasers
 are either the original EG&G lamp, FX-103C-3 or the replacement EG&G
 flashlamp, FXQ-1302-3. Since this ruby laser's cavity is not actively
 cooled (merely convection cooled) the maximum average power rating for
 these lamps are 20 watts and 150 watts respectively. Consider an input
 of 100 joules to this first lamp. This would limit repetition rate to
 one pulse every five seconds. This same input to the replacement lamp
 rated at 150 watts would give you a safe maximum pulse rate of 1.5
 pulses per second. Of course an increase in pump energy to the lamp
 would decrease the maximum safe repetition rate.
<p>
<li>The second point to consider is the capacitor charging power supply.
 As with any cap charging circuit it takes a certain amount of current to
 charge a capacitor in an allotted time.  I = CV/t, again. :-) The PFN
 that is commonly available contains a capacitor of about 160 uF. Charging
 this capacitor to store 100 joules will require a maximum voltage of about
 1,120 volts. To be able to charge this capacitor to this level, at a
 repetition rate equal to the average power rating of the
 convection-cooled FXQ-1302-3 lamp, would require a power supply capable
 of providing at least 1120 VDC at about 270 mA.
</ol>
<p>
Ruby was never meant to be pulsed at a great repetition rate. Another
problem that one would face at high repetition rates is the overheating of the
ruby rod, which does not dissipate heat too well (unlike YAG). This can
permanently damage the ruby crystal.

AC Line Power Supply for SSY1 (SG-SP1)</A>.  An alternative design which runs
from low voltage DC is described in the section:
<A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg2">Sam's Inverter Power Supply for SSY1
(SG-SI1)</A>.
<p>
For initial testing, figuring it would be real effort to get it lasing, I used
my trusty IR remote control tester for detecting the beam.  Big mistake. :( The
first shot sent the photodiode off to photodiode heaven (or wherever faithful
photodiodes go when they die).  Its output just stayed on!  I should have used
the IR detector card available from Radio Shack (and elsewhere).
<p>
OK, so go to plan B. :)
<p>
I placed a piece of black coated paper in front of the laser and fired off a
few shots.  No effect except for a bright blotch of white light from the
flashlamp.  (Maybe I didn't examine it closely enough.)
<p>
Next, I tried a small lens approximately focused on a piece of black coated
paper.  To make sure any effect wasn't just due to spill from the flashlamp,
these were positioned about a foot from the laser head.  Immediate
gratification!  The moderately focused output beam easily obliterated the
black coating on the paper.  This was accompanied by a very nice 'snapping'
sound and white or yellow incandescent plume when hitting the black coating,
and a more muted sound after the black stuff had vaporized.  When carefully
focused, it will make nice tiny holes in aluminum foil (the incandescent plume
is green-blue in this case) and other thin materials, and mini-craters on
thicker objects.  I've heard of people driving this laser with much higher
energies to blasting holes in razor blades (see below).  However, it is all
too easy to blow up the laser components when doing this - the flashlamp and
Q-switch are most susceptible to damage or destruction.
<p>
I don't have any way of actually measuring the energy of the beam but let's
just say it is definitely not something to be taken casually, as far as eye
safety is concerned!  My wild off-the-top-of-the-head guestimate would be
at least 10 mJ, probably 20 or 30 mJ, though it may be as high as 50 to 100
mJ.  Hopefully, someone will eventually measure the output pulse energy!  The
Nd:YAG rod is probably capable of much greater energies but that flashlamp
doesn't look all that sturdy so I'ms not about to push my luck, at least not
yet. :)
<p>
The lasing threshold is about 7.5 J - less than the energy of the electronic
flash in a typical pocket camera!  This low value is no doubt due to both the
cavity and optics design - and the optimal pulse length from the PFN.  Thus,
using one of those cheap flash units (or just its power supply) directly
probably wouldn't work at all as the duration of the flash pulse would be way
too long with insufficient peak intensity.  (The unit described in the
section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssllrf">Micro Laser Rangefinder Using
Disposable Flash Pumped Nd:YAG and OPO</A> is based on a much smaller
Nd:YAG rod - about 1/8th the volume.)
<p>
Here are the specifications, as best I can determine:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Beam characteristics.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Wavelength: 1,064 nm.
 <li>Divergence: A few mR (not yet measured).
 <li>Quality:  A simple positive lens will focus the beam to a microscopic
  spot.
 <li>Output energy: Estimated between 10 and 50 mJ.  It is at least equal to
  "1 Alcoa". :) The laser will punch a hole in kitchen-strength aluminum foil
  when focused (but doesn't do razor blades using the 15 J PFN).  Over 100 mJ
  is possible on "lively" units up at 900 V on the PFN1.  However, repeated
  operation at these energy levels tend to destroy the Q-switch and adjacent
  rod AR coating.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing medium.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Type: Nd:YAG rod, AR coated ends.
 <li>Rod diameter: about 4 mm.
 <li>Rod length: about 50 mm.
 <li>Lasing threshold: less than 7.5 J (100 us pulse duration).
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Flashlamp - This looks similar to an ordinary photographic variety, perhaps
  somewhat higher quality, but <b>not</b> the very high quality EG&G FXQ style
  lamp.  It may be a FXQG-264-1.4 or FXQSL-559-1.4.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclss1s">Shawn's High Energy Experiments with the
  SSY1 Laser Head</A>.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Arc length: 35 mm (about 1.4 inches).
 <li>Outside diameter: 5 mm.
 <li>Inside diameter: 3 mm.
 <li>Overall length: 75 mm.
 <li>Ko impedance parameter: 16 ohms-amp<sup>0.5</sup> (estimated).
 <li>Flashlamp envelope: quartz.
 <li>Electrodes: machined solid tungsten.
 <li>Minimum voltage: less than 300 V.
 <li>Maximum voltage: greater than 1,000 V.
 <li>Maximum energy input at 100 us pulse duration: 25 J (guessed!).
 <li>Recommended energy input at 100 us pulse duration: 15 J at 900 V.
 <li>Maximum average power input: 7 W (estimated).
 <li>Trigger: External trigger electrode (white wire).
<p>
 <li>Manufacturer: Probably either EG&G or ILC (likely available from both
  companies) but I haven't been able to locate the specific model on their Web
  site - it is not one of EG&G's 1300 series but may be an FXQG-264-1.4 (see
  below).
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Optics - Mounted at each end of the SSY1 assembly against machined flat
 posts - no adjustment possible or needed for basic operation.  However, it
 seems as though the alignment on these is is not generally anywhere near
 perfect.  And, some samples are quite poor.  It's quite possible that this
 is the main reason for differences in output energy on undamaged units.
 It would be interesting to install one of the mirrors on an adjustable
 mount and determine if any significant improvement is possible.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Flow tube: Dual chamber for flashlamp and rod, slightly yellow tinted
  glass.  Since this is an air-cooled laser, the term "flow tube" is used
  only because that's what it would be in a liquid-cooled laser. :)
<p>
<li>Cavity reflector: A thick white powder coating the outside of the
  flow tube and itself covered with plastic.  I don't know whether the
  powder is toxic but wouldn't recommend removing it in any case since it
  is very effective.
<p>
 <li>Cavity length: 9.3 cm (3-5/8").
<p>
 <li>High Reflector (HR): 12 mm diameter x 5 mm thick.  Exterior surface
  appears slightly bluish (but may vary with coating run).  The HR is
  normally at the Q-switch end (black and white leads of flashlamp).
<p>
 <li>Output Coupler (OC): 12 mm diameter x 5 mm thick.  Exterior surface
  appears slightly greenish (but may vary with coating run).  The OC is
  normally at the non-Q-switch end (red lead of flashlamp).
<p>
 <li>Passive Q-switch: There is a third element adjacent to the HR-end of the
  rod.  Its surfaces appear coated and slightly gold-ish in color.  This is a
  the passive Q-switch.  It uses a dye that is bleached (turns clear) once the
  light intensity in the cavity exceeds a specific value.  The Q-switch is
  tack-glued into position and can be removed intact by carefully drilling out
  two glue plugs on either side.  It is a chamber about 7 mm in diameter
  with optical flats on either end and some sort of dye material in between.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Physical configuration - Overall dimensions (excluding mounting feet)
  are 25x25x105 mm.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Outer casting: This holds the cavity assembly in position between the
  fixed (precisely aligned) HR and OC mirrors and provides a pair of bolt
  holes for mounting of the overall laser head assembly.
<p>
 <li>Cavity assembly - The reflector and trigger electrode are part of an inner
  assembly which includes the rod fastened at one end and the Q-switch at the
  other, with the flashlamp adjacent to rod.  Actually, there is no highly
  reflective reflector. :)  The rod and lamp sit inside a glass (probably or
  perhaps, quartz) tube with a double bore.  This is surrounded by a layer of
  some very white stuff which sort of looks like plaster or drywall compound.
  An outer wrap of tough plastic keeps the white stuff in place.  The white
  material does reflect most of the light into the rod and diffuses it at the
  same time.  So, energy distribution into the rod is probably quite uniform.
  However, some light is wasted as the white stuff is not totally opaque - the
  flash of the flashlamp can be seen through its surface.  Plastic caps glued
  to the ends of the double bore thing are what actually hold the parts in
  position.
<p>
  The white flashlamp trigger lead is connected to a fine wire that runs the
  length of the inside of the bore where the flashlamp lives.
<p>
  The cavity assembly may be detached from the outer casting by removing 4
  screws providing access to the inner surfaces of the HR and OC, and the rod
  ends for cleaning.  The flashlamp may then be removed by unscrewing a nylon
  fastener at the anode/OC-end and carefully straightening the cathode lead.
  CAUTION: Avoid touching the flashlamp envelope.  If you do so by accident,
  clean it thoroughly to remove all traces of skin oils.
<p>
 <li>Electrical connections: Approximately 6 inch long flexible wire leads
  for flashlamp anode (red), flashlamp cathode (black), and external trigger
  (white).  CAUTION: Don't apply excessive force to the red and black wires
  as they attach directly to the terminals of the flashlamp.  Also, don't
  twist the white one as it can come loose from its glue and break the
  fine trigger wire inside.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Power Supply - I built a line powered capacitor charger and
 trigger using PFN1.  See the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg1">Sam's
 Power Supply for a Small Nd:YAG Laser Head (SG-SP1)</A>.
<p>
 The maximum energy input using this power supply is 15 J (36 uF capacitor
 charged to 900 V.  Nearly 100 percent of the energy in the capacitor is
 transferred to the flashlamp.  An energy of 15 J may not sound like much but
 it is more than adequate (actually twice the threshold) for pumping the 50 mm
 rod with the optimal 100 us pulse duration and well designed cavity
</ul>
<p>
Note: The dimensions are from my memory or lack thereof - I haven't measured
them since getting SSY1 to lase, corrections welcome.
<p>
WARNING: Despite its small size, this is a Class IV laser.  While SSY1 probably
won't set anything on fire unless you fire it at an explosive or have a
natural gas leak, this laser is quite capable of doing serious damage to
vision.  Treat it with respect!  Cover the HR mirror aperture (I used black
electrical tape) since there may be some leakage from there which is invisible
and enclose the output beam path so that backscatter can't hit anything of
importance (like your eyes).

<h3><A NAME="sclsy1v">Variations in Performance of SSY1s</A></h3>

Depending on how much use or abuse any given SSY1 has had in a past life,
there could indeed be significant differences in output energy for the same
input energy.  I don't know to what extent this may happen for samples that
appear to be in perfect condition but it should be possible to identify
obvious problem areas.  Inspect the Q-switch dye cell, flashlamp, rod ends,
and optics for dust, dirt, discoloration, mottling, and physical damage.
If the dye cell appears anything but perfect, it probably should be removed
as its condition will only deteriorate with use.  Discoloration of the
flashlamp will reduce the amount of light to the rod but unless it is very
severe, won't prevent the unit from working but will just increase the lasing
threshold slightly.  Unlike a HeNe laser with its low gain, a spec of dust
won't kill lasing but a careful cleaning probably won't hurt.  For anything
beyond light dusting, use proper laser mirror cleaning procedures to avoid
damaging the optics.
<p>
I've now tested 3 of these babies - 2 that appear to be in original condition
and another with the Q-switch removed and the AR coating gone from one end of
the rod.  (I've also used the mirrors from an SSY1 to construct the resonator
for another YAG cavity, see the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclmyl">Mini
YAG Laser using SSY1 Optics and SG-SP1</A>.)  The two intact units produce
about the same output energy.  The other one lases but probably at slightly
lower energy.  It still smokes black tape (possibly better than the other
ones) but won't penetrate aluminum foil.  The sound it makes when focused on
a target is also softer.  However, I don't know to what extent these
differences are due to the lack of a Q-switch versus the missing AR coating
It's probably a combination of both but the reduced effect on thermally
conductive aluminum foil and softer sound would be consistent with the longer,
lower peak power pulse produced without a Q-switch.  Perhaps at some point in
the future, I will swap rods with an original SSY1 to separate out the
effects of the missing Q-switch and AR coating.
<p>
CAUTION: Although the capacitor in the PFN that comes with SSY1 is rated
for around 35 uF at 900 VDC, running at this energy may destroy the Q-switch
dye cell and possibly the AR coating on the YAG rod adjacent to it after
not too many shots.  Some samples may survive almost indefinitely
but others could succumb in less than 100 shots.  I would recommend
limiting the voltage for repetitive use to 700 or at most 750 VDC.

<p>
I got bored this afternoon and figured I would dig out the SSY1 I bought a few
months ago on ebay from Meredith.  If that is not the easiest laser to get
lasing, I don't know what is.  I think it is easier than modifying a green
pointer! :-)
<p>
I started with two plain old 330 uF, 400 V electrolytic caps in series from my
junk box (I have some 1,500 uF 450 Cornell Dublier electrolytics, but I didn't
want to take out the Q-switch yet).  I then dug out a smallish 12 VDC-powered
hene supply (for like a 1 to 2 mW tube and wired that up to the caps
through ten 100K 1/2 watt resistors wired in series (for 1M at 5 W).  I
found a dented old auto ignition coil transformer deep in my junk boxes and
I wired up a 4:1 divider using 1M 1/2 resistors off the caps to charge a
small 2.2 uF 250 V capacitor.  To fire the laser, I turn on the HeNe laser
power supply, watch the voltage across the main caps charge (about 20 V per
second or so) and then when it is at the desired voltage, I short the 2.2 uF
cap across the input terminals of the auto ignition transformer, whose coil
is hooked up to the trigger wire of the SSY1.  I then took a note from
Sam's experience and wound about 55 turns of 14 gauge plain old solid
copper wire with thin plastic insulation around an used up plastic speaker
wire container bobbin.  I measure the inductance of the completed coil with
my LC meter and found it to be 199.5 uH.  Not bad!  Overall though I would
say it is the crudest SSY1 power supply yet! :-)
<p>
For the very first shot I was not absolutely sure which end was the output,
lol, so I put a black electrical tape target about 2 inches from each end.
I let the main caps get to 450 V total and then shorted the 2.2 uF cap to the
transformer.  A nice satisfying flash! and a perfect 3-4 mm white spot on the
electrical tape on the end with the red wire (ah, the output end, heh heh).
<p>
I then found a 1.5" FL lens and proceeded to de-anodize some aluminum.
The thing is loud when it is focused.   I am actually adjusting the focal
length as I type (while waiting for the cool down of the SSY1 lamp (what is
the duty cycle on these things anyway?  (Figure about 10 W average power
into the lamp. --- Sam ) I am giving it about 3 to 5 minutes between
pulses).  I think I may be able to make some small craters in the black
anodized aluminum, but maybe not until I swap out the series 330 uF caps for
the series or paralleled 1,500 uF ones (after removing the Q-switch).
<p>
Not a bad little laser for $125.  It really deserves a better supply
though. :-)
<p>
(A day passes.)
<p>
I just fired a shot from my SSY1 with 165 uF caps (two 330 uF caps in series)
charged to 550 V (so about 25 joules) into a Molectron J25LP-0686 sensor head
with a responsivity of 5.0 V/joule at 1064 nm.  I measured a 620 mV pulse on my
oscilloscope.
<p>
This would mean the output power from the SSY1 at 25 joules to the flashlamp
is 124 mJ.
<p>
Is that even remotely possible?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Might be a bit high, but not out of the question.
<p>
(From: Rick.)
<p>
It does punch a hole through aluminum foil at this power level, and also it
pits a stainless steel razor blade (but does not punch through).
<p>
It also left a 4 mm mark on the carbon looking sensor head... whoops. :-(
<p>
While making some more power measurements from my SSY1, I heard an
increasing snapping sound as I went up in pump joules.  Since I have the
power sensor head well past the focal point of a positive lens (normally I
would hear this snapping sound when I focused the spot on a piece of
electrical tape or aluminum foil) I was wondering where it was coming from.
I then covered the SSY1 with a piece of cardboard to mask the flashlamp
light spillage and fired it up at 165 uF, 700 V (40 J).  I saw a bright
pinpoint flash of light at 1.5 inches from the lens in mid air!  Very very
cool (first time I have seen this phenomenon, though I have heard of it).  I
guess this gives another data point to the output power level...  Air sparks
at 200 to 400 mJ? :)
<p>
I am going to try and capture this on video and stick it on my Web site.
<p>

<p>
Use a shorter focal length lens and the light show will be even more
spectacular and/or occur at lower energy.

<p>
You can push them really hard.  I ran about 1 kW average input power for 5 
seconds at a time, letting it cool about two minutes between bursts.  I had 
a small fan pointed at it, but no real forced air.  It didn't like this, 
but I did it quite a few times and it still works fine.  The yellowish 
plastic around the cavity is discolored brown from the heat - it was 
probably close to 400 &deg;F and it didn't fail.

On another note, the laser described below is the modern version of SSY1
which is similar, perhaps even a bit smaller:
<p>
(From: Erbium1535 (erbium1535@aol.com).)
<p>
The South Carolina State Museum in Columbia uses a Nd:YAG laser to pop a
balloon inside a balloon in their Townes exhibit. (C.H. Townes was born in
Greenville, South Carolina.) The laser, manufactured by Kigre, Inc. in Hilton
Head, SC is a Q-switched MK-367 unit and is described on the
<A HREF="http://www.kigre.com/mk367.shtm">Kigre MK-367 Nd:YAG Laser
System Page</A>.  The actual laser is approximately 0.6 x 0.8" x 4" in size
and emits a 17 mJ pulse pulse with s duration of less than 4 ns.  They also
offer a frequency doubled green version.  The MK-367 was originally developed
for the ophthalmic surgical market, specifically as a photo disrupter for
posterior capsulotomy. The power supply is approximately 4" x 4" x 1.5" and
operates from 12 VDC.
<p>
The laser is somewhat unique in that it is permanently aligned, utilizes a
ceramic exoskeleton for stability, and a positive branch confocal resonator
design for high beam brightness. Kigre has sold more than a thousand of these
miniature lasers for various applications including medical, industrial,
rangefinding, and pyrotechnic ignition. The MK product line has been around
for more than 15 years, so these lasers sometimes find their way to the used
laser discounters.  New ones are still available and cost about $3,600. If you
do come across one of these, be very careful as it is a very powerful Class IV
laser!  (Yes, but the SSY1 is potentially an even more powerful Class IV
laser! --- Sam.)

<h3><A NAME="sclpss1">Patrick's SSY1 Experiments</A></h3>

(From: Patrick Jankowiak.)
<p>
I have some news about what I have done with the SSY1.  The Q-switch
is retained.  I used two lab power supplies (ye olde tube-type monsters) to
charge the stock PFN to 800 VDC, and used the trigger pulse from a small
photoflash unit to fire the flashlamp.  The discharge resistor made a
convenient current limiter for the charging.  I first tried it with the
photoflash unit to charge PFN1 but my SSY1 would not fire at the
photoflash-supplied 400 V on the lamp.
<p>
I had no carbon paper so I took a
small white cardboard box and a black 'Sharpie' pen and painted a square
made of 5 layers of ink, allowing the ink to dry between layers.  I was
gratified to see the laser work the first time and ablate the ink nicely.
The ink method may be better than carbon paper for some purposes.  I took
pictures and videos which I hope will be interesting.  The Kodak P850
camera is ideal since it does 30 fps video at 640x480 resolution.  It also
allows one to edit the video in-camera as well as extract individual frames
to create images.  OK, this is not a Kodak Ad, just saying what gave me good
and easy results without having to buy editing software.  One thing that
surfaced is the apparent TEM02 mode of the laser.  This appeared in the
ablation marks in the ink.  They were very hard to see by eye but the
camera picked them up.  The mode marks seemed to remain the same from pulse
to pulse, so I believe it is genuine.  I hope you enjoy the pictures and
videos.  Some are quite large, but I made also an animated GIF where I
increased the brightness and reduced the speed and you can really see the
smoke.

Well, I have to say, that's the BIGGEST SSY1 capacitor charging power supply
I've ever seen.  Heck, a 6 VDC input HeNe laser power supply can easily
charge PFN1. :)
<p>
As far as the TEM02 mode pattern.  I think that's just the tip of the iceberg.
The diameter of the SSY1 rod with the plane-plane resonator is much too large
to assure a TEM00 mode, probably by at least a factor of 2.  So the actual
mode pattern may be much more complex than what is appearing in the smoked
ink.

<h3><A NAME="sclss1s">Shawn's High Energy Experiments with the SSY1 Laser
 Head</A></h3>

WARNING: The passive Q-switch will not survive the abuse inflicted by high
energy operation for very long - it is a high failure item even under normal
conditions.  The mirrors apparently tolerate it better but these also may
degrade after awhile.  And, even if the flashlamp doesn't explode, the pulse
repetition rate must be very low so as not to exceed its average power ratings
and to limit heating of the rod and the entire assembly.  Using PFN1 (36 uF,
900 V), MTBF may be in the 100K shots range; this may drop by several orders
of magnitude with ultra-high energy operation!
<p>
(From: Shawn West (west007@libcom.com).)
<p>
I've taken a different approach than the others and am pumping it with a long
pulse, about 2.5 ms.  With my long pulse I have put a 0.020 inch diameter hole
in a 0.004 inch thick razor blade.  I've punched holes through aluminum foil
of different thicknesses too.  I've back calculated the energy required to
punch the holes in the razor blade and the two aluminum foil experiments.  The
calculations show that it would have taken 1.7 to 1.8 joules to melt and
vaporize the metal in each case (if I did my calculations right).  When I hit
the razor blade with 800 volts on the capacitor (360 joules) I was able to
punch a 0.024 inch diameter hole in the 0.004 inch thick blade.  My
calculations, which again could be wrong, show that it would have taken about
2.5 joules to do this.  These calculations do not include the amount of
reflected energy or the energy conducted away from the material.  I have also
sparked the air using a short focal length (about 1.5 cm) lens.  I'ms using a
1,120 uf capacitor with approximately a 0.15 ohm ESR.
<p>
My inductor is 820 uH with a resistance of about 0.15 ohms. It is from
<A HREF="http://www.partsexpress.com/">Parts Express</A> (part #266-760,
about $23).  The inductor is wound with an effective 12 gauge copper foil
and has an air core.  I'ms using a piezo-electric igniter from a gas grill to
flash the tube.
<p>
I have also used a 270 uF capacitor and a 80 uH inductor (ESR of 8 or 9
milliohms).  However, the longer pulse PFN put out more energy (more
destruction to the target) than the short PFN when the caps were charged with
the same energy.  This could have been due to the ESR differences of the two
capacitors or the higher current density with the shorter pulse PFN exciting
the shorter wavelengths of the xenon (i.e. not exciting the 800 nm hues as
well to mate with the Nd absorption).  I'ms trying to keep the current density
in the flashlamp below 4,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> to favor the 800 nm absorption
band of the Nd:YAG crystal.  I also wanted to pump out a lot of energy.  This
forced me into a long pump pulse.
<p>
I spoke to Jim McMann (sp?) from Perkin Elmer (EG&G) about the flashlamp in
mid-December, 1999.  His phone number is 1-800-950-3441.  At that time, he
thought the flashlamp was an FXQG-264-1.4.  From what I have found out since
then, there are two EG&G flashlamps that could have been used for the SSY1.
The first is the FXQG-264-1.4.  This flashlamp is made from titanium doped
quartz that cuts off UV wavelengths below about 225 nm.  The second is the
FXQSL-559-1.4.  This flashlamp is made from cerium doped quartz that cuts off
UV wavelengths below about 320 nm.  I don't know which one was originally
used.
<p>
Both of these have a 1.4 or 1.5 inch arc length, and are probably xenon filled
to 500 Torr (though I have not been able to verify the fill pressure).  The ID
was 3 mm and the OD was 5 mm.  If you calculate Ko with a 1.4 inch arc length,
you get:

Using a 1.5 inch arc length results in a Ko of 16.6 which is what I measured
it to be.
<p>
For the more conservative arc length of 1.4 inches with a 3 mm bore, the
explosion energy for the flashlamp = time<sup>.5</sup> * 90 * arc length in
inches * bore in mm = 378 * time<sup>.5</sup>.  (Time is in milliseconds.)
<p>
I designed this to run from 300 volts (50 joules) to 800 volts (360 joules).
My damping factor (alpha) ranged from 1.03 at 300 volts to 0.8 at 500 volts to
0.63 at 800 volts.  I think at about 560 volts the current density in the
flashlamp was about 4,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.  The explosion energy with a 2.5 ms
pulse is about 590 joules and at 800 volts I was running at about 60% of the
explosion energy.  I normally run at about 560 volts where alpha = 0.76, at
30% of the explosion energy (about 177 joules), and the current density is
about 4,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> in the flashtube (the approximate maximum current
density for which the 800 nm line is strongly excited).  When I was hitting
the razor blade and the aluminum foil the capacitor was charged to 700 volts
(274 joules - about 46% of the explosion energy).  The maximum pulse rate is
about once every 45 seconds.  Right now my charger is running from 120 Vac but
I plan to make this portable and run from 12 volts with a pulse rate
capability of about once every 30 to 40 seconds.
<p>
I have not removed the Q-switch to see the effect yet.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Well, that's certainly impressive!
<p>
I assume that with the Q-switch, you are actually getting a series of short
pulses of a few dozen mJ each.  My quick off the top of my head calculation
for output energy using the Q-switch would be 25 to 50 times 20 or 30 mJ which
is in the .5 to 1.5 J range so your calculations of output energy may not be
far off.  This laser would probably also do nicely with an arc lamp if you
could cool it somehow. :)
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
My scope is getting calibrated now, but when I get it back I'll check the
reflected light to see I am getting a bunch of pulses or a long continuous
pulse with a steep front end (maybe even a spike on the front end of the
pulse).  Does this Q-switch have a self terminating bleaching effect
independent of incident power or does it remain bleached as long as the power
is above a certain threshold?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I don't know for sure but assume that it returns to its non-bleached state
immediately after the laser pulse and until the spontaneous emission (not
the incident flashlamp power) exceeds the threshold again.  Not knowing the
exact composition of the dye used here, I can't say what the exact time is.
For the rangefinder, the likely objective would be one intense pulse for each
firing of the flashlamp so there would be no need to select one that
recovered quickly but they do exist.
<p>
(From: Greatest Prime (FishyBill@mediaone.net).)
<p>
The nickel complex BDN in toluene has a recovery time of about 1 ns.
(Actually, you can make it in a number of ways. One is to dissolve BDN in
methyl methacrylate and polymerize it. You have to watch out the active
catalysts do not destroy the dye.)  This allows for multiple pulsing. Other
dyes and solvents tend to shorten the recovery time. That is what makes mode
locking possible at a pulse repetition rates of more than 100 MHz.  However,
repetitive operation of dye Q-switched lasers is more complicated than merely
considering recovery time of the dye. There usually are long term thermal
effects of considerable importance.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
It might be possible to test the SSY1 laser for multiple pulsed operation
by firing the flashlamp with a longer than normal pulse.  Once the first
Q-switched output pulse depletes the upper energy state, the Q-switch should
revert to its non-bleached condition.  If the flashlamp is still on, the cycle
should repeat.  Doubling the flashlamp pulse duration from 100 to 200 ns while
maintaining approximately the same flashlamp light intensity should be enough
and this can probably be done safely (for the flashlamp and dye cell at least
for a few shots to perform the test) by doubling the values of the PFN
capacitor and inductor.  I've heard of rangefinder lasers similar to the SSY1
failing in a way that results in multiple output pulses - this may be a way to
experiment with this mode!  Diode pumped solid state lasers take advantage
of this effect to generate a series of very short pulses with very consistent
energy between pulses and a rate determine by the pump input.
<p>
One way to determine the pulse shape or pattern would be to fire the focused
laser beam at a rotating disk with a piece of black paper or carbon paper
glued to its front surface.  The shape of the burn mark or pattern of spots
should reveal whether it is lasing CW for the duration of the input pulse or
pulsing at a regular rate as would be expected if the Q-switch were active
the entire time.  A 75 mm diameter disk rotating at 3,600 rpm would result in
a linear velocity of about 1.4 mm/100 us for this laser oscilloscope. :)
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
I noticed that my divergence is significantly greater with the long pulse (2.5
ms) versus the short pulse (approximately 400 us).  Do you have any thoughts
on why this could be happening?  How much more energy do you think I could get
out if I removed the Q-switch?
<p>
When I was using the short pulse PFN I could discolor a black piece of
cardboard about 2.5 feet away with the spot size only growing slightly
(perhaps a few mm in diameter).  However, with the long pulse PFN, I placed a
piece of black cardboard about 3 inches from the output coupler (and hit it)
and then moved it back 4 inches (about 7 inches from the output coupler) and
the diameter grew by about 2 mm.  At about 1 foot from the output coupler I
can't discolor the black cardboard with the long pulse PFN.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
That's interesting and could indicate that the dye does remain bleached after
the initial pulse.  Or, the dye bleaches from the center out which would
restrict the area of lasing when Q-switched.
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
Are you thinking that if the dye bleaches from the center out in combination
with the applied pulse duration, then the Q-switch will effectively clip the
higher order modes letting only TEM00 to oscillate.  However, with a long
pulse, the dye possibly remains bleached over the whole rod diameter which
permits the higher order modes to oscillate creating the high divergence.
Maybe I should pull the Q-switch and insert an aperture into the cavity to
clip the higher order modes?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
As far as total energy, if the Q-switch is not participating after the initial
pulse, than it won't make much difference.  However, if the dye bleaches and
recovers quickly, then perhaps it could be significant.
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
I use a cheap 660nm laser pointer to bore sight the laser.  When I get the
laser pointer lined up I can see the "orbit" reflections that seem to surround
the fundamental spot.  However I thought with a plano-plano cavity the
reflected spots tend to follow a line from the fundamental or follow a slight
curve (i.e., not surround the fundamental spot).  Could this cavity be a near
hemispherical or a plano-plano cavity?  If this is a near hemispherical cavity
could that explain why the center of the q-switch would bleach first?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I thought it was a plano-plano cavity but didn't check carefully.  Just look
at the reflections from the optics of something distant and see if they
look flat. :)
<p>
Shining a laser pointer into  it you also have reflections from the rod ends
and the Q-switch to confuse things.  I'll have to check...
<p>
I just went and used a HeNe laser reflected off the mirrors with a piece of
paper to block the reflections from the rod ends and Q-switch (so they wouldn't
confuse things).  The mirrors appear to be planar as far as I can tell but
this still isn't conclusive since I was just kind of holding the thing steady
and trying to view the reflected spots.
<p>
It does look as if the rod ends and/or Q-switch is ground on a slight angle
because without the paper, there is a distinct far off-axis spot.
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
I noticed that far off axis spot too when I'ms bore sighting it with the laser
pointer.  Do you think it would be worth it to put an aperture in the cavity
and how big of an aperture do you think would be good to use?  What is
confusing me is that the output of the side of the rod closest to the
flashlamp seems to put out more energy and I am trying to envision the optimal
location for the aperture (i.e., should the aperture be placed off centerline
toward the flashlamp side).
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The fact that you get more energy off-center suggests (at least to me) that
the cavity is indeed planar.  A cavity with curved mirrors would tend to
homogenize the distribution I would think.
<p>
What are you hoping to accomplish with an aperture?  Obtain a TEM00 beam?
That may not be possible from such a short cavity.  There's a magic number
for a given cavity configuration to determine if a TEM00 beam will be produced
(sorry, I don't have the equation or the value for this laser) but I bet it
would require a rather narrow beam.
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
I was just hoping/dreaming to be able to project the unmanipulated beam
further.  I think you are right again about the planar cavity.  A near
hemispherical cavity should have more energy in the center.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Well, you can still expand/collimate it and that will help but if you were
after HeNe-like beam quality, not likely. :)
<p>
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
I fixed my divergence problem.  I remember when I got the laser, I illuminated
the bore and noticed a slight star-burst pattern that seem to be coming from
the Q-switch.  Yesterday, I noticed the star-burst getting more pronounced.  I
guess my higher energy pulse must have aggravated the existing imperfection.
So, I removed the Q-switch.  My divergence problem has gone away.  I'ms
assuming that the imperfection in the Q-switch was dampening the oscillations
in the center of the laser rod.  The beam now grows about 0.1 to 0.15 inches
in diameter over a 3 foot distance.
<p>
Before, when I charged my capacitor up to 700 volts (about 275 joules) I
could only put about a 0.020 inch diameter hole in a 0.004 inch thick razor
blade.  Now, without the Q-switch I can put a 0.033 inch diameter hole through
the same razor blade.  If you just ratio the changes in volume the output
energy has increased by over 2.5 times.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, I've heard that the dye based passive Q-switch is one of the items that
fails most often (the other being the flashlamp).  So, it may have been
slightly bad to begin with but your super power pulses might have really
done it in!
<p>
For those who haven't yet begun to abuse SSY1, it is probably best to remove
the Q-switch dye cell before attempting to run at much higher energy input than
the 15 J max of PFN1.  To do this, detach the rod/flashlamp assembly from the
resonator frame (make a note of the direction in which it is installed).  At
one end you can see an AR coated end of the YAG rod (I think there is a screw
at that end which holds the rod in place).  At the other end is the Q-switch
dye cell (slightly larger diameter than the rod) which is held in secured with
some tan or brown adhesive which has to be removed to free it.  There is a tiny
fill hole where some adhesive was forced in on the side - using a drill bit
in your hand to remove what's in there may also be needed.  Take care to
avoid scratching or breaking the dye cell - you may want to replace it at some
point in the future (and that dye cell originally cost something like $200!).
<p>
Without the Q-switch, the output will not be as short a pulse but may actually
result in more total energy (though less peak power).
<p>
(Several months pass.)
<p>
I have now built everything into a portable self contained unit (including
the laser pointer target designator) that could operate from a 12 VDC source.
A pushbutton must be held in to charge the caps but there is an overvoltage
cutoff to prevent accidental overcharging.  There is an LCD readout for
capacitor voltage.  Of course, the most important part of this rig is my
pair of 1,064 nm laser safety goggles!
<p>
I've fired well over 2,000 shots with my SSY1 setup and there appears to be no
decrease in output power (based on the diameter of hole through a razor
blade).  The Q-switch has long since died and was removed about 2,000 shots
ago. :)  My max pulse rate is about 1 shot every 45 seconds.  EG&G says that I
am driving the flashlamp properly.   I bought a couple extra flashlamps just
in case.
<p>
I've made a sort of hodgepodge laser power meter.  I sliced a piece of
carbon from a carbon zinc battery anode.  The slice is 0.239" diameter
(6.071 mm) by 0.065" thick (1.651 mm).  I epoxied a thin piece of
plastic to the back of the carbon disk to act as an electrical insulator
for a Fluke k-thermocouple junction.  The thermocouple junction was
epoxied perpendicular to the flat surface of the disk.  I used an 805 nm
laser diode to "calibrate" the disk.  The laser diode is calibrated.  I
set the laser diode to put out 1 watt.  I put the carbon disk in front
of the laser diode aperture and turned on the laser for different
durations as measured by an oscilloscope.  I took several measurements
while measuring the delta T and time duration for each exposure to the
laser diode.  Approximately 2 minutes elapsed between each measurement. 
My data is shown below:

Energy into the sensor in joules = time duration in seconds since the power
input is 1 W.  The average MC comes out to be 0.246 J per Deg C.
<p>
It took about 10 seconds for the temperature to stabilize.  I guess that
the thermocouple wires were not bleeding away the heat too fast.
<p>
I charged up the capacitor for the SSY1 to different voltages and fired
it into the sensor which was about 1 foot away.  I have a laser pointer

* Smoke came from the sensor during these measurements!
<p>
The flashlamp energy was calculated by the Pspice simulation.  The following
are some of the things that were not considered in the measurements:

<ol>
<li>I'ms not sure if the entire SSY1 output beam was hitting the carbon
disk a foot away.  The disk is about 6 mm in diameter and the beam at the
output coupler is about 4mm.20
<p>
<li>When smoke came from the disk (as indicated by a * above), I'ms not
 sure how much energy was actually being lost due to vaporizing some of
 the surface of the sensor.
<p>
<li>I'ms just guessing that the absorption of the 805 nm laser diode is
 about the same as the 1.06 um SSY1.
</ol>

I'ms looking for a larger diameter piece of carbon so that I can expand
the beam without vaporizing spots on the surface.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Cut, file, or grind one of your carbon rods to create some slices length-wise.
Sand them smooth and butt the long edges together to form a larger surface
area.  Yes, I know this will be messy!
<p>
You're getting me interested in trying this stunt.  I have a pair of 1,800 uF,
450 V computer grade electrolytic caps.  Yes, I know, not laser caps, but at
with relatively discharge pulse, might survive.  With the caps in series, at
800 V, they would provide about 288 J; at 900 V, about 360 J.  Or, better yet,
I should run them in parallel which would be slightly less efficient but would
eliminate any issues of voltage balancing, reduce the stress on the flashlamp,
and the air-core inductor would only need to be about 200 uH.  I have plenty of
thick wire to wind it.
<p>
I would remove the Q-switch before the first shot so that it would live to
pulse another day. :)  I also have some other mirrors with cosmetic defects
which I might substitute as well.  The same capacitor charger I used originally
with SSY1 would work fine here though I might have to beef up the current
limiting resistor's wattage a bit. :)
<p
(From: Shawn.)
<p>
As I mentioned, the air core inductor I used was from parts express.  It was
about 2.5 inches in diameter and about 2 inches long.  It was wound with
copper foil 2 inches wide and used insulation between each layer.  However,
here is a formula for the inductance of a coil whose length is greater than
0.4 times its diameter:
<PRE>
                                        d<sup>2</sup> * t<sup>2</sup>
          L (Inductance in uH) = ---------------------
                                  (18 * d) + (40 * b)
</PRE>

Where:
<ul>
<li>d is the mean diameter in inches.
<li>t is the number of turns.
<li>b is the length in inches.
</ul>

So, here are some options for 820 uH:

<ul>
<li>68 turns, 6 inches in diameter (110 feet of wire).
<li>48 turns, 12 inches in diameter (150 feet of wire).
<li>34 turns, 24 inches in diameter? (210 feet of wire).
</ul>

You can see why the inductor from parts express was so attractive.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>

Nah, that's cheating. :)  I found a 3 inch diameter form during a walk in the
park - from a Hallmark(tm) party ribbon or something - perfect.  Extrapolating
from the tables above, a 200 uH inductor would require about 50 turns.  I
actually wound 55 turns in 5 layers using #14 insulated solid building wire.
This isn't exactly magnet wire but the insulation is still rather thin so it
packs nicely.  The 55 turns should yield a bit more inductance - perhaps 250
uH - resulting in a slightly longer pulse.  So much the better - it will be
easier on the flashlamp.
<p>
I located the pair of 1,800 uF, 450 V caps and confirmed that their ESR is
still unmeasurable (0.0 ohms) but I will probably need to reform them since
they are quite old.  I even have a preliminary power supply design.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg5">Sam's High Energy AC Line Power
Supply for SSY1 (SG-SP3)</A> and stay tuned for exciting developments.

<h3><A NAME="sclss1o">Other High Energy Experiments with the SSY1 Laser
 Head</A></h3>

(From: Jay Byler (rjaby@aol.com).)
<p>
I successfully fired the SSY1 with a cap bank at 64 uF at 985 V. It made a
very clean hole through a razor blade in one pulse with the aid of a
focusing lens.  I understand that this is running the tube pretty hard at
input of around 31 J.  I could not find out how long the tube would last
under such stress.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
That's very impressive since the energy input is significantly lower than
that discussed above!  I do assume you removed the Q-switch dye cell as it
probably wouldn't last long under this abuse.  As far as lamp life, it is
running 3X or 4X of the energy normally used in the rangefinder application.
So, life will be reduced but it would be necessary to calculate the expected
life based on the lamp's specifications.

<h4><A NAME="sclss1p">Pspice Program for SSY1</A></h4>

(From: Shawn West (west007@libcom.com).)
<p>
I put together a OrCad (formerly Microsim) Pspice simulation that accurately
models the flashtube characteristics (with a given Ko) that agrees with
measured results.
<p>
Based on the simulation, the amount of energy that actually makes it to the
flashlamp terminals is about 75% of the capacitor stored energy for my PFN
setup.  So for my previous % of explosion energy numbers you can multiply by
0.75 to get the real % explosion values.  So, for worst case (800 volt = 360
joules stored on the capacitor) only about 270 joules make it to the flashlamp
which gives a % explosion energy of 270 / 590 = 45% rather than the theoretical
maximum of 60% as previously stated.
<p>
The Pspice files (ASCII text) for the flashtube follow.  You
can change Rctrl from 1u to put the reverse diodes in the circuit or a 1M
resistor to take the diodes out to see if you would be getting any negative
ringing current.  Resr is the ESR for the capacitor and Rind is the resistance
of the inductor.  You can set the capacitance, inductance, Ko, and the initial
capacitor's voltage in the PARAMETERS box.  You can use Rsense to display the
flashtube current.  Vtube is the voltage across the flashtube.  The energy
line integrates the tube voltage x tube current to arrive at the energy that
makes it to the flashtube to gauge the efficiency of your circuit.  For the
energy line 1 volt equals 1 joule.  The key for proper simulation is to know
the proper C, L, Rind, and especially Resr.

<h4><A NAME="sclsy1g">Frequency Doubling SSY1</A></h4>

It is possible to produce pulsed green (532 nm) output from SSY1 without
too much difficulty.  In fact, it is trivial if your SSY1 has its Q-switch
in place and in good condition..
<p>
The peak power of SSY1 is something like 16 mJ/4 ns which is 4 MW.  I'd expect
order of 1 mJ of green without any optics - just put the KTP in the beam and
adjust its orientation for maximum green output.  The green beam will be
almost coaxial with the IR beam with a walk-off of only about 4.5 mR.  One
problem though is that the beam from SSY-1 is not polarized so you will lose
some efficiency there.  I don't know how much.  But if the KTP is aligned
properly, there should definitely be some green photons produced.  First try
this simple approach to the determine if the green pulse energy and consistancy
are acceptable.  There is no space inside the SSY1 resonator for a Brewster
plate with the Q-switch in place so one of the mirrors would have to be
re-mounted externally.
<p>
CAUTION: I recommend using an aperture to make sure the IR beam hits only
the clear central part of the KTP as at high enough power/energy, it could
conceivably damage or destroy the KTP if it hits something that absorbs
significantly.  (However, as I found out, this is probably critial with
SSY1 driven from PFN1.  See below.)
<p>
Adding optics to concentrate the 1,064 nm beam would boost the energy density
significantly.  However, this is tricky because the peak power is so
high and damage to the KTP is all too likely if the beam waist becomes too
narrow inside the KTP even if it is all through the center.
<p>
I finally did some very basic experiments.
<p>
Using SG-SP1 as the power supply (adjustable from 0 to 900 V, 36 uF capacitor
in PFN1, 0 to 15 J, 100 us pulse duration at maximum output) and a 2x2x5 mm
piece of flux grown KTP similar to what's available from CASIX and Roithner
for use in small to medium power DPSS green lasers.  For a mount, I simply
placed the KTP on a block of, wood shimmed so the KTP was approximately
centered in the beam (very precise!).  Here are the results:
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, I tried an SSY1 head which had had its Q-switch removed.  Although
 it lased and would burn holes in Zapit paper when roughly focused (and from
 previous experiments, in aluminum foil), I could not get any detectable green
 from my KTP even after very carefully adjusting its position and orientation
 on my block of wood.
<p>
<li>Next, I used an SSY1 head with its Q-switch in place.  This produced green
 on the first shot, even just above threshold (700 V or about 8 J into the
 flashlamp).  Adjusting the angle of the KTP had some effect but not anything
 as dramatic as results with a CW DPSS laser.
</ul>
<p>
The reason of course for the difference in behavior between the two lasers
is that although the total energy may be similar with and without a Q-switch,
the peak power without the Q-switch is on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 or more
times lower (a pulse duration of 100 us as opposed to 4 ns).  Since the
frequency conversion process is non-linear, it is the peak power which
ultimately determines the amount of doubled output.
<p>
I would estimate the green output to be in the 1 mJ range (give or take a
factor of 5) but have no real way of measuring it precisely - only eyeballs
that haven't been calibrated in a few years. :)  The consistency from
shot-to-shot was fairly good, again as determined by eye.  The green version
of the Kigre MK-367 puts out about 4 mJ.
<p>
Increasing the input to the flashlamp to its maximum value of around 15 J
did increase the brightness of the green flashes but not dramatically.
<p>
I didn't take any special precautions to protect the edges of the KTP and
no damage could be detected after the experiments anywhere on the KTP.  So, at
these power/energy levels, this concern would seem to be unfounded for a few
dozen shots at least.  However, your mileage may vary.
<p>
So, get out your SSY1s and chunks of KTP and fire away. :)
<p>
WARNING: Take care with respect to reflected invisible IR and visible green
beams.  The KTP and any other external optics should either be fully enclosed
or covered with a material that doesn't pass significant radiation at
1,064 nm.  Green scatter should be identified and blocked as well.

<h4><A NAME="sclsy1h">High Power SLM Green from SSY1</A></h4>

Bill Jensen, from the <A HREF="http://www.holographyforum.org/">Holography
Forum</A> has modified the SSY1 and PFN with some interesting results.
He replaced the original passive Q-switch which could not handle high
peak power with a new Cr4+:YAG passive Q-switch and add an intracavity
etalon in an attempt to obtain a single longitudinal mode.  He also, made a new
PFN using much higher uF caps and a custom inductor.
<p>
After the beam goes through an IR-blocking filter, he is getting 160 mJ
of green with 50 J into the flashlamp.  The lamp needs to cool for at least
1 minute between shots.  After some nay-sayers said the laser couldn't take
being pumped like that, he set up a PIC microcontroller that fired
the laser once a minute for over 2,000 shots.  The green output from
the laser did not go down.

<h4><A NAME="sclsy1u">Using SSY1 to Make Holograms</A></h4>

(From: Adam.)
<p>
I've made some pulsed holograms using SSY1-based DIY "YAGna" laser.
I'm following Bill Jensen's experiments.
For now It's a single SSY1 (no amplifiers yet) equipped with a Brewster
window (there is enough space for a window in a cavity). I'm putting 6.5 J
into the flashlamp (just above the lasing threshold).
I'm getting 30 to 36 mJ of 1064 nm and 10 to 15 mJ of 532 nm
after conversion in a 5x5x5mm KTP crystal.

SSY1 is unmodified (except for the Brewster window).
There is no intracavity etalon, yet the coherence length is at least 18 cm
(depth of one of my transmission holos).  Is it possible that the passive
Q-switch acts as an etalon?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Very interesting......
<p>
I would have expected not only the issue of coherence length due to
the large number of longitudinal modes, but also multi-spatial mode operation.
While the coherence cycle is the length of the cavity, the wide gain
badwidth of Nd:YAG permits many many longitudinal modes to oscillate.
<p>
I suppose it's possible the Q-switch is acting as an etalon, expecially
if its AR coatings aren't perfect (especially if damaged!).  This might
cut down the number of longitudinal modes somewhat.
<p>
There's still a lot about SSY1 we really don't understand....

<h4><A NAME="sclsy1t">Other SSY1 Tidbits</A></h4>

(From: Wayne Verish (wverish@aol.com).)
<p>
Just when I thought I had run out of things to point my little Yag laser at I
decided to try a tuft of steel wool (no soap please!). The result was
surprising! With the voltage cranked up to 900 volts, and the output focused
through a simple hand lens the shot ignited a small portion of the steel wool,
which then rapidly proceeded to consume the entire pad! This will be
interesting to capture on video or digital camera.
<p>
Tired of smoking carbon paper with your SSY1?  Try steel wool if you dare.
Also a great way to blast holes in those pesky free CD rom disks you get in
the mail!

<h2>Laser Photonics YQL-102 Pulsed YAG Laser</h2>

The best description of this laser is that it is an SSY1 on steroids. :)
<p>
Actually, the rod and flashlamp are similar in size to those in SSY1, but it
uses an active Q-switch in a self aligning cavity with a power supply capable
of 20 shots per second at over 100 mJ per shot and a pulse duration of
about 15 ns.
<p>
The laser head is about 16 inches long and is attached to the power supply via
a fixed umbilical including lines for liquid cooling of the flashlamp.
<p>
Inside the laser head is the flash cavity with the lamp and rod.  The
electrodes are dry so the coolant only needs to be pure enough such that
it doesn't degrade with UV exposure, and beasties don't grow there. :)
The optics include a prism at the back end that is actually a section
of a cube-corner so the path is a folded "U" - the reflected beam is
returned parallel to the incident beam but offset horizontally.
A flat plate at the front has both the OC
and HR.  I assume the coatings differ but haven't attempted to inspect
closely or remove the plate.  There are no fine alignment screws.  Darn!
However, there may be a couple of wedges to do this  There is also a
Brewster-angle plate to polarize the beam, and possibly a waveplate,
in addition to the Electro-Optic (EO) Q-switch (Pockels Cell?).  The
shutter is a Ledex solenoid-operated flag.
<p>
The power supply/controller is HEAVY - about 75 pounds - though probably half
the weight is in the steel box that houses everything.  It's a 7" high
19" rack mount form-factor, though the chassis components mount to
the outer box and cannot be removed as a unit.  Most of the electronics
is in the front half of the chassis, while the chiller occupies the back half.
A high frequency inverter charges a HUGE electrolytic capacitor
while a separate pulse capacitor drives the flashlamp.  It must use
series triggering since there is no trigger transformer in the head.  Not
surprisingly, there are more interlocks on this thing than the Space Shuttle,
including one should the part of the chassis with the chiller be moved
out of position (not sure how that could happen by accident though!).
The chiller consists of a centrifugal pump, a liquid-to-air heat exchanger
with fan, and a reservoir bottle.  Everything the coolant comes in contact
with is made of plastic.
<p>
The only controls other than switches for power, shutter, and Run/Standby,
is the pulse repetition rate selector - Manual, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, pps.
There is an external trigger input.  The energy/pulse is fixed.
<p>
Here are some photos:

<p>
<li><A HREF="yql102-o.jpg">Laser Photonics YQL-102 Laser Cavity Optics</A>.
 Going counter-clockwise from the enclosure with the YAG rod and flashlamp,
 there may be a pair of Risley prisms for fine alignment, the section of a
 cube-corner at the far left, two other unidentified optic plates, a Brewster
 angle polarizer, the EO Q-switch, and the HR mirror hidden inside the
 thick mount.  The OC is also in that same mount.  They are both coated
 on a single rectangular glass plate.  The mechanical shutter is at the
 far right with the small dangling cable being for the Emission Indicator
 lamp.  At the far left, the protective cover over the umbilical can just
 be seen.
<p>
<li><A HREF="yql102-c.jpg">Laser Photonics YQL-102 Laser Controller</A>.
 The control panel has (from left to right): Shutter enable and indicator,

 indicator.

<h2>Quantronix Model 114F-O/QS Quasi-CW YAG Laser Head</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sclq114d">Description and Specifications</A></h3>

This is a high power liquid cooled arc lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser from the
early 1980s (my sample is dated 1981).  Although the head looked like it had
fought a losing battle with one of those M-1 tanks, the rod, cavity reflector,
and optics appear to be in pristine condition.  Considering the general
condition of this laser and the nasty hole in the cooling chamber lid (that
isn't supposed to be there) in particular, the fact that the most delicate
components came through totally unscathed must rank as one of the minor
miracles of the past Millennium. :)  However, the arc lamp appears to
be up to air due to overheating and breech of the solder seal (not physical
damage).  This was confirmed by testing with both a flyback based high voltage
generator and HeNe power supply.  It was most likely that failure which
resulted in the the laser being removed from service.  This unit originally
was Q-switched - unfortunately the Q-switch had been scavenged - perhaps by
the crew of that M-1 tank. :)
<p>
Photos of a Quantronix 114 (in slightly better condition) can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.71 or
higher) under "Quantronix YAG Lasers".
<p>
Here is a general description though specifications are somewhat sparse:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Beam characteristics:</b> TEM00 or multimode.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Wavelength: 1,064 nm.
 <p>
 <li>Output power: 10 W TEM00, 35 W multimode.  CDRH safety sticker says:
  Nd:YAG CW/50 ns, 200 W max.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Lasing medium:</b>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Type: Nd:YAG rod, AR coated ends.
 <li>Rod diameter: about 3 mm.
 <li>Rod length: about 75 mm.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Arc lamp:</b> With adequate cooling, this is probably good for 3.5 kW
 or more continuous input power.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Arc length: 76 mm.
 <li>Outside diameter: 7.5 mm.
 <li>Inside diameter: 6 mm.
 <li>Overall length: 140 mm.
 <li>Envelope: Quartz.
 <li>Electrodes: Cathode is conical, anode is hemispherical.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Mirrors:</b> HR and OC are in removable aluminum cylinders (2 screws
 each) on adjustable mounts at ends of resonator frame (see below).  These
 mounts have the goofiest design I have ever seen - the movable part is on a
 spherical bearing (a milled and polished hunk of stainless steel, the
 equatorial portion of a sphere), that rotates in an aluminum bushing.  A pair
 of 100 tpi screws press on it at the 3 O'clock (X) and 12 O'clock (Y) with
 (springs behind these positions).  This would appear to be an overly complex
 (or at least excessively huge) way of implementing a true gimbal mount -
 where both axes of rotation are about a single point.  Even after cleaning and
 lubrication, it doesn't seem as precise as a more vanilla flavored design.
 And, to think of the cost of machining those precise spherical surfaces!
 Give me a Newport MM2 any day. :)  (Note that companies like Newport do have
 small, simple, inexpensive - at least as these things go - versions of gimbal
 mounts.)  However, what this geometry does provide is an absolutely constant
 position for the center of the mirror.  If that was the reason for the
 peculiar design, I don't know why it would be so critical in this laser.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>High Reflector (HR): 12 mm diameter x 7 mm thick.  Exterior surface
  appears slightly yellowish.
<p>
 <li>Output Coupler (OC): 12 mm diameter x 7 mm thick.  Exterior surface
  appears slightly greenish.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Output lens:</b> A rather strong negative lens in a threaded barrel was
 found with the laser so I assume it was screwed into the bezel at the output
 aperture - probably part of a beam expander.
<p>
<li><b>Beam power sensor:</b> What looks like a silicon photodiode behind a
 piece of frosted glass is mounted beyond the HR on its threaded bezel with
 its output via an SMA coax connector.
<p>
<li><b>Physical configuration:</b> Overall dimensions of laser head: 200 mm (W)
 x 125 mm (H) x 500 mm (L).  Weight of about 10 kg.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Resonator frame: Heavy cast aluminum base with thick cast and milled
  plates to hold mirror mounts bolted to both ends.  There was originally an
  aluminum sheet metal snap-on cover which I don't have and its mating
  end-plates were mangled beyond recognition anyhow.  I did manage to salvage
  all the safety stickers (actually thin aluminum plates). :)
<p>
 <li>Cooling assembly - Overall housing is thick white nylon or some similar
  plastic insulating material with plumbing connections for the coolant as well
  as flow and temperature sensors.  Dimensions of main body are roughly
  110 mm (W) x 200 mm (L) x 75 mm (H).
<p>
 <li>The rod is mounted in a quartz (?) and stainless steel tube about 15 mm
  OD with elaborate O-ring seals at each end to mate with coolant channels in
  the coolant housing.  The arc lamp is similarly mounted but with a fiber or
  plastic insulating material instead of metal at each end (for obvious
  reasons).
<p>
 <li>The cavity reflector is a polished gold plated steel cylinder squashed
  into an elliptical shape by a pair of milled Plexiglas blocks.  Polished gold
  plated brass caps are screwed to both ends.  Length is a bit over 3 inches
  to match with active region of rod and arc lamp.
<p>
 <li>Electrical connections: Thick wires with screw-in terminals for the
  arc lamp. 
<p>
 <li>Iris diaphragm: An adjustable aperture is located near one of the mirrors
  to restrict the diameter of the beam.  It could be used for some beam
  cleanup, to restrict power, or to control the mode structure (i.e., force a
  TEM00 beam).  This is not really a user adjustment being accessible only
  from inside the case.
<p>
 <li>Q-switch - Since I don't have this unit, I can't say anything definitive.
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="sclq114c">Chris's Comments on the Quantronics Laser</A></h3>

(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
It looks as though you have got the makings of a nice project. A 'bashed
up' laser is better than no laser at all. :-) At least the most important
components survived. If you could provide me with the number on the arc
lamp, perhaps I could uncover what it actually is. Typically a krypton arc
lamp of 70 mm arc length and a 5 mm bore (EG&G, FK-125-C2.75) filled to 2
atmospheres would operate at 100 volts at 30 amps. With this typical input
power of 3 kW, coolant flow rate should be at least 120 cm<sup>3</sup>/s.
<p>
The conical and heimspherical electrodes are common. The pointed cathode is
to help maintain arc stability.
<p>
There is a similar EG&G Krypton arc lamp (FK-111-C3) which has a 7 mm bore
with a 75 mm arc length rated at 6,000 W with liquid cooling. Electrical
characteristics are 112 VDC at a whopping 56 A. Wall loading is 145
W/cm<sup>2</sup> as opposed to the smaller 5 mm bore lamp of
110 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.  However, average lamp life is only 40 to 60 hours,
whereas the FK-125-C2.75 should last from 400 to 600 hours with proper cooling.
<p>
Sam, where's your sense of adventure? :-) I think an attempt to refurbish
this laser as an arc lamp-pumped CW type would be fascinating. Consider the
cost of a new flashlamp, the likely necessity to install a new OC of a
lesser reflectivity for successful pulsed operation, and the need of a PFN,
as opposed to the challenge of building a phase-controlled arc lamp power
supply. The design and construction of a PSU such as this strikes me as
something that would be right up your alley. I have recently acquired a 6
inch arc length, krypton-filled arc lamp and have considered the construction
of such a supply myself. Of course, the lamp that I have will require about
40 amps at 150 VDC! I've got a 10 kW isolation transformer.  So there's a
start. :-)
<p>
Interesting that the OC reflects green. I would tend to agree with you that
this laser was not likely doubled. The OC for SHG would normally reflect close
to 100% of the fundamental wavelength and transmit about 100% of the harmonic.
This being the case, I would doubt such an optic would appear to reflect green.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Geez I dislike even working on the power supplies for little air-cooled
argon ion lasers with their current-hog requirements let alone 40 A at
150 V!! :)
<p>
It is definitely not a green YAG and I don't even know if intra-cavity
doubling had been introduced in those days.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
As far as the Q-switch is concerned, I would expect that it was not a simple
mechanical system like the one on the Hughes MS-60 ruby laser.  I would tend to
doubt that a rotating prism Q-switch would be used in-line. Usually if a
mechanical Q-switch was going to be used in-line, it would be a rotating HR
mirror at one end of the resonator. A roof prism is most often the rotating
element in such a system because of its retro-reflecting properties, which
assures alignment in one direction, while the rotation of the prism brings in
alignment in the other direction.
<p>
Mechanical Q-switches tend to be rather slow as compared to electrooptical
and acousto-optical Q-switches and judging from the rated pulse width
achieved by this laser, I doubt that a mechanical Q-switch would be able to
achieve that 50 ns pulse duration.

<h3><A NAME="sclq114e">Ed's Comments on the Quantronics Laser</A></h3> 

(From: Ed Xavier Gonzalez (ohlaser@flash.net).)
<p>
The power supply/heat exchanger on my 116 requires 208VAC 3 phase to
crank the silly thing up.  Admittedly, Quantronix did over design the
power supply for worldwide use, so the transformers and control circuitry
are a bit over-kill.  The important point, however, is the fact that a lot
of juice gets sucked up generating a clean initial pulse to jump start the
krypton lamp and then maintain the 25-35 Amps DC to keep it going.  Also,
the water for the cooling needs to be kept VERY clean (as you may already
know).  The micron and de-ionizing filters basically make de-ionized water
from store bought steam-distilled, ozonated water.  Any particulates in the
water stream when the lamp is running is a sure guarantee that the flowtubes
and the lamp jacket are going to get coated and cooked!
<p>
Be careful YAG rod assembly.  Some of the original flowtubes were uranium
doped quartz to stabilize the UV into visible wavelengths.  Just a word of
caution.
<p>
The endplates you describe as "polished gold plated brass caps" are now gold
plated nickel, since brass has a tendency to contaminate the DI-coolant and
turn stuff green.  Not good for the flowtubes or the lamp and crystal.
<p>
The Q-switch on my 116 is an 25 W RF driven Acousto-Optical model from
IntraAction Corp.  My guess is the 114 was probably driven the same way.
<p>
Anything in the DI-coolant stream should be nylon or stainless steel.
No brass, bronze or anything else.  The DI-water will pull "tons" of metal
ions out of the fittings and put them into the coolant.  Also (and this one
is a real stretch), under no circumstances should the DI-water be consumed
internally!  It would literally take the calcium out of your blood-stream
and in enough quantities could kill.  Sounds strange, doesn't it:  Ultra
pure water will kill you!  Takes the elemental ions right out of your system,
or so I've been told.  We'll have to leave that experiment untried!

<h2>Varo Erbium:Glass Laser Rangefinder</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sclvarod">Varo Rangefinder Description</A></h3>

This is a flashlamp pumped pulsed laser rangefinder using an Er:Glass rod to
operate at an eyesafe wavelength of around 1,550 nm.  The term "eyesafe" only
means that the wavelength will not pass through the lens of the eye and hit
the retina.  It doesn't mean that one can stare into the laser and not have
it blow off the front of your eye!  The output pulse from the laser head
(before beam expansion) at the normal rangefinder energy (600 VDC on the
capacitor) is enough to blast holes in aluminum foil with at most, moderate
focusing.  At 700 VDC, no focusing is needed at all.  It uses a
motor driven Q-switch (erbium has a very long upper state lifetime (at least
4 ms) so this is actually quite easy).  In fact, although the electronics
does synchronize flaslamp firing with the motor position, this really isn't
even needed.

I have some further info for you regarding the Varo erbium laser module.
This module is part of the portable AN/GMQ-33 "Cloud Height Set."  This
meteorological instrument is used to determine ceiling height from 100 to
3,000 feet AGL. It runs on a 24 Volt NiCd or LiSO<sub>2</sub> battery and
is 12" x 14" x 13" and weighs 32 pounds.  Operation is as follows: Level
set; turn on; do self-test; hold switch away from set; press once to start
laser charging cycle; when ready light comes on, making sure not to look
into lens, press switch again and laser will fire.  Display will indicate
ceiling.
<p>
I just picked one of these up from a government sale.  It passes self test
and I opened it up (except for the sealed laser module) and checked for
loose hardware and other problems (none seen) and am charging the batteries
tonight and will test it out tomorrow.  Seems like a cool item.
<p>
Of course, it there are serious problems, I don't think I could
possibly afford to get mine fixed if it doesn't run.  The
acquisition cost for this instrument is $97,879.00!!

is through a pair of 15M resistors.  For testing, I added a bleeder resistor
of 40K, 10 W across the capacitor.

<p>
The power input of 24 VDC was estimated based on how high it had to be
before the +/-Va voltages started regulating - about 20 VDC.  It's possible
that the normal input would be 28 VDC since that might be more standard.
<p>
The Motor Driver Board (MDB) connects to the Power Supply Board (PSB) and to
the Q-switch motor and position sensor and nothing else.  The motor is just
a high speed permanent magnet DC motor.  The sensor is an LED/PD pair.  There
are signals from the power supply to both turn the motor on and
off and to request a firing pulse.  There are a couple of flip flops
on the driver board (74HC74) and some other "stuff" in addition to the power
enable transistors.
<p>
Thus, the firing pulse actually originates from the MDB and get passed
through the PSB to the SCR that triggers the flashlamp.

<h3><A NAME="sclvaroo">Operation of the Varo Laser Rangefinder Laser</A></h3>

CAUTION: Due to the extremely high peak intracavity power of this laser, it
is extremely critical that the ends of the rod, Q-switch prism, and OC mirror
be absolutely free of any contamination.  Otherwise, one or all may be
damaged on the first pulse.  Before powering up the laser, use a strong
light and magnifier to  carefully inspect all optical surfaces.  If anything
is detected, use proper optics cleaning procedures to restore the surface(s)
to a pristine state.  If this isn't done, your laser may only lase once.
<p>
The following is based on my partial reverse engineering of the PSB and MDB
and will fire the laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Wire pins 1, 3, and 11 to ground.
<li>Use a 24 VDC, 5 A power supply for the main power (pin 9).
<li>Have a +5 VDC power supply available for logic control  This can be made
 from resistor and zener off of the +24 VDC if desired since it's low current.
 I used 15K to +24 and a 1N4732A (4.7 V) zener.
<li>Enable interlock/disable bleeder during testing.
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Apply main power of +24 VDC to pin 9.  HV should come up to around +600 VDC
 after a few seconds.
<li>Apply +5 VDC to pin 7.
<li>Pull pin 13 to TTL high (+2.4 to +5 VDC).  Q-switch motor should spin up
 and flashlamp should trigger once it's up to speed.  Motor then shuts down.
<p>
 If pin 13 is tied to pin 10 or TTL high, laser firing sequence will commence
 automatically after step (2).
</ol>
<p>
The laser does not fire if the steps 1 and 2 are performed out of order, and
then all power has to be removed to reset.
<p>
However, permanently connecting the TTL high derived from the zener circuit
described above to pin 7 appears to work.  Then, it's just a matter of
applying +24 VDC, giving the capacitor time to charge, and then pulsing
pin 13 high to initiate the firing sequence.  Or, if pin 13 is tied high or
to pin 10, the laser will fire automatically once the capacitor has charged.
So, apply power and after after a few seconds, the laser fires and shuts down.
<p>
WARNING: Make sure the laser output is directed to a safe place!  It might
be more or less eyesafe with the original optics in place but you probably
ripped them out a long time ago exposing the raw beam with is narrow and
nasty. :)
<p>
These procedures fire the laser exactly once.  Then power has to be removed and
the sequence repeated to fire it again.  The capacitor is virtually totally
discharged after firing so the PFN works really well.  It doesn't recharge
automatically but don't bet your life on it!!!  I don't know if this is the
normal behavior or whether something is broken or there is a reset signal
that needs to be applied to get it to recycle without removing power.
<p>
I also really don't know if the way I've got it to work has any relation to
how it's supposed to work!  This laser does not output a beam because there
is damage to the end of the rod facing the OC mirror.  This apparently will
happen if there is the rod-ends are not absolutely and perfectly clean due to
the high peak intracavity power during the Q-switched pulse.  It goes through
all the motions and I have no reason to expect there is an electronics
problem at this point.  However, if it's detecting a fault (there is an
unidentified signal from the MON module - perhaps that's its function) then
a fully functional laser might not shut down after firing but will recharge
automatically ready for the next shot.
<p>
WARNING: Disable interlock/enable bleeder when not actually using laser!
<p>
So, in summary for simplest operation: Build a zener circuit to produce
a TTL high level from the input supply and connect it to pins 7 and 13.
Connect the zener and input supply ground to pins 1 and 3.  Enable
interlock to disable bleeder and apply power to pin 9.  A few seconds
later, the Q-switch motor will spin up, the flashlamp will fire, and
the motor will shut down.  Remove input power and reapply to fire another
shot.  Disable interlock if done with the laser.

<h2>Adlas 300 Green DPSS Laser</h2>

Adlas (Advanced Design Lasers) are the folks who originally designed the
Coherent Compass-M series of green DPSS lasers that we know and love (see
the next section).  The 300 series appears to be a predecessor of sorts to
the Compass-M.
<p>
There are a number of versions.  An older one, the DPY-305c
consists of a power supply unit and laser head, which looks sort of
like a Startrek phaser: <A HREF="dpy305c1.jpg">Adlas DPY-305c Laser Head</A>.
The power supply attaches to the laser head via
a cable with an 8 pin plug, but there are only 6 separate connections as
the main power feed is doubled up with two pins for +5 VDC and return.
That leaves 4 remaining signals, 2 of which are fat wires and the other
two are the same color.  These are for the TEC drive.
Indeed, the resistance across the two fat wires is close to 0 ohms.  And
although one of the wires to the connector is green (it's not ground!),
a tell-tail fat red wire can be seen spliced to it snaking into the bowels
of the laser head, approximately where the TEC would be.  So, it's almost
certain that the laser diode driver is entirely within the laser head
powered solely by 5 VDC, but the TEC driver is in the power supply box.
<p>
The unit I'm testing is a model DPY305c, no output power rating listed.
The laser head itself has quite a bit of circuitry in its squarish rear
section, along with a heatsink and cooling fan.  The laser/optics are
in a cylinder protruding out the front.  Unfortunately, gaining access
to the laser/optics appears to be a major undertaking, requiring extensive
disassembly. The circuitry inside the laser head is on two small PCBs, one
above the other, attached via wiring and components with additional parts
sandwiched between them.  From the similarity in some of the
electronic components that are used, it's possible that the same designers
worked on the Adlas 300 prior to developing the DPY315M and what
later became the other Compass-M lasers.  But none of the spiff and polish
of the Compass-M construction is evident anywhere in this laser head and
some of the soldering is absolutely dreadful.  It looks like getting to
the laser optics platform may be near impossible without extensive
disassembly and unsoldering of wires or worse.
<p>
The laser powers up but is extremely unstable with wild and continuous
output power fluctuations between less than 1 mW and perhaps 50 mW, though
the 5 VDC power is rock stable.  The actual rated output power is not known
but it has been suggested by a Web search that some versions of the Adlas
300 at least are rated up to 250 mW.  (The CDRH sticker lists 300 mW for
532 nm so that can't be the rated output power.  Not surprisingly,
these stickers are identical to those used on the Compass-M lasers!)
Given the difficulty of access and the relative rarity of these lasers,
I'm not sure how far I will go.  If anyone has additional information
on these lasers, please contact me via the

<h2>Adlas DPY 105/205/305/315 Series II Green DPSS Laser</h2>

These are the predecessors to the Coherent Compass-M DPSS lasers described
later in this chapter.  They date from around 1993 to 1996, which is about
the time when the Adlas DPY315M - later to become the Coherent Compass 315M -
appeared.  In some ways, the earlier lasers are more sophisticated in having
full microprocessor control (compared to a couple of PLDs in the Compass-M
Analog Controllers).  But the pedigree is quite obvious, in the same sort
of search algorithm being used to optimize lasing parameters.  Models range
from 10 mW for the 105 to 100 mW for the 315.  They are otherwise physically
similar consisting of a large heavy power unit, a compact light weight
controller, and a modest size laser head with removable heatsink.
<p>
The power unit is probably more than just a set of DC power supplies, but
also the actual regulated current sources for the pump diode and TECs,
which are then programmed by the controller.
<p>
Except for the key-lock power switch; power, emission, and READY LEDs; and
"CAL" and "SCAL" pushbuttons (more below), all of the user interface - what of
it there is - takes place via an RS232 port.  This allows the output power to
be changed, shows status, and enables the initiation of the CAL and SCAL
functions.  A DB9F to DB9F cable with pins 2 and 3 swapped is required
to connect it to a PC.  Protocol is 9600 baud, 8 bit, no parity.  I used
PCPLUS emulating a Televideo 925 but the basic interface doesn't use any
screen commands, so the terminal type is irrelevant.  However, there is
a special "ADLAS.EXE" program (DOS/Windows) that may do more.
<p>
These lasers use a linear cavity like the Coherent Compass-M, but with
nothing folded, not even the output beam path.  So, the pump diode is at
one end and the output aperture is at the other.  Thus, the lsaer head
is about twice the length of C215M or C315M with a similar or slightly
larger cross-section (not including the heatsink).
<p>
When first powered up, the laser goes through a CAL procedure based on the
previous power setting, which is stored in NVRAM.  CAL keeps the pump
diode temperature and current fixed, and systematically varies the
resonator parameters over a limited range while monitoring output
power and keeping track of the maximum during this search.  The
parameters that are varied are probably RES and KTP temperature
as with the C315M.  It then goes back and tries to lock using the
stored parameters - what it calls the "test point".  If unsuccessful after
some predetermined time or number of complete searches, it goes to
SCAL or "Super Calibrate" which widens the range of variation including
bumping up the pump diode current, and if that doesn't work, eventually
incrementally decreases the selected output power until it succeeds, or
fails and gives up.
<p>
When powered from a cold start, or when running CAL or SCAL, the RS232
spits out several numbers periodically.  The first two are probably
essentially the RED and KTP temperature coordinates as they increment
in a fixed sequence.  The third number is proportional to the output
power.  For every set of 3 numbers, it also spits out about 16 lines
with simply an "*" located in proportion to the output power.  So, watching
the lines scroll down the screen shows a rough graph of the power trend.
The user manual describes this by stating that "some activity can be
observed which is of no meaning to the user". :)  When it has completed
a search, it resets the parameters to the "test-point" values and tries
to lock if the peak output power it has memorized is at least equal to
the selected output power.
<p>
Once the laser becomes READY, the output power is very stable with only a
slight drift as everything reaches a steady state temperature.  However,
it's possible that it may call for a CAL to be initiated (automatically)
if parameters drift too far during warmup.  This would be similar to
the behavior of the Coherent C215M, where the overall resonator is not
temperature controlled.
<p>
While the specifications do not mention single frequency or Single Longitudinal
Mode (SLM), the first one I have tested is definitely very pure SLM and should
be ideal for holography or interferometry applications.
<p>
Here are some photos:

<h2>Coherent Compass-M Green DPSS Lasers</h2>

Note: Information on adjustment and repair of these lasers has been moved
to the chapter: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strtoc">SS Laser Testing, Adjustment,
Repair</A>.

<h3><A NAME="sclcpsmd">General Description of the Compass-M Lasers</A></h3>

There were three lasers in this family: The C215M, C315M, and C415M.  They
are all very high quality 100 mW green
DPSS laser manufactured by <A HREF="http://www.cohr.com/">Coherent, Inc.</A>.
It is one of their Compass series.  Information and datasheets may be found
by taking the "Product", "Lasers", "Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers", and
"CW DPSS Lasers" links at their Web site.
<p>
These lasers were originally developed by a company named Adlas (Advanced
Design Lasers) in Germany.  Adlas was bought by Coherent but only the newer
models have the Coherent part number.  They all appear to still be
manufactured in Germany.  Older C315Ms have a DPY315M model number but
except possibly for minor revision differences of the head PCB which
are mostly artwork related, they appear functionally identical.
There were a number of earlier Adlas models with a similar basic design
but quite different construction and packaging.  See the sections starting
with: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#scla300">Adlas 300 Green DPSS Laser</A>.

The third generation Adlas laser designs which includes the C215M, C315M, and
C415M, were a "major" upgrade and so Coherent than just bought Adlas to
solve the problem of their lack of a high quality low to medium power
green laser, or something along those lines. :)  The Ads for the Adlas
DPY 315M only ran for a couple months and then they came out as Coherent.
<p>
According to information that used to be on the Coherent Web site, the C215M
and C315M are supposed to be single frequency (single longitudinal mode)
lasers and as such, the coherence length should be extremely long and ideal
for holography and interferometry.  The only reference still present there
that confirms this is the "Comparison Chart for Continuous Wave (CW) Solid
State Diode Pumped Laser Systems" at the bottom of the "CW DPSS Lasers"
page, above.  The Coherent Web site has been flip-flopping on this over
the years since acquiring the technology in the late 1990s.  Unlike the
Coherent 532 green DPSS laser, these do not use a ring cavity but
a more conventional Fabry-Perot (linear)
cavity, though it would support single longitudinal mode operation if the
birefringence of the KTP were used in conjunction with the Brewster plate to
create a birefringent filter or if the KTP had surfaces coated (or uncoated) to
act like an etalon.  Both of these appear likely.  (See the cavity
descriptions, below, and the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315f">Birefringence or Etalon Effect Used for Mode
Selection in C315M?</A>.)  Since the spec is no longer present, I wonder if
they are indeed guaranteed to be single mode.  One current specification in
support of single mode operation is the optical noise - less than 0.25 percent
RMS from 10 Hz to 1 GHz for the C315M and C415M; and 0.5 percent RMS for the
C215M.  This would most likely be orders of magnitude higher
if these lasers were not single mode.  And I did do some tests of
one sample of a C315M laser head and indications are that it is indeed single
mode under most conditions.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315s">Testing the C315M
Laser Head for Single Frequency Operation</A>, which also includes some
comments suggesting that under certain conditions, another mode may be
present, but at a very low level.  However, note that the Coherent chart
says the C415M is "broadband" meaning not single frequency, yet it still
claims the low optical noise.
<p>
I've only known of a few C315M lasers that operated non-single frequency
after stabilizing on the Coherent controller.  One would just mode hop
back and forth at a few Hz between two very clean modes at certain power
levels but could be tamed by setting the power slightly higher or lower.
Another had "ghost" modes at any power setting with associated "spiking"
behavior - high amplitude oscillations in the output power.
And a third would do this but mostly at higher power.
However, I was able to get a randomly selected C315M laser
head to produce a low level (but stable) second mode when driven using
a laboratory controller set so the laser was operating near one end of
the Nd:YAG gain curve.  But it would run reliably single frequency on the
Coherent controller.  Also, some units will briefly go to non-SLM during
initialization when the KTP and/or RES temperature is changing.
I've also seen one C315M that produced a very low level (less than 2
percent of the output power) second mode that was always there, at least
a higher output power.  None of this is particularly conclusive with
respect to factory fresh C315M lasers because I've never seen one.
All those I've tested have been either removed from service due to
an upgrade, or for unspecified problems, some of which might be related
to the observed behavior.
<p>
Adlas and Coherent have both waffled on guaranteeing SLM operation.
They will only say that most of the units are SLM most of the time.
I assume that when stabilized near the middle of the gain curve, they
will tend to be SLM.  But if the controller gets carried away trying
to achieve the selected output power without increasing pump diode current
and it ends up off to one side of the gain curve, then maybe that's when
it may have sustained non-SLM operation.  And some units are more prone
to this than others due to age, sex, phase of the moon, etc. :)
<p>
Most of the information below is for the C315M since these laser heads have
been showing up surplus most commonly, often along with the Coherent Analog
Controller (LD and TEC driver unit with analog user interface), and
occasionally with the Digital Controller (which plugs into the Analog
Controller and adds a computer interface).  The C315M is available in
power ratings from 20 to 150 mW though the most common one on the
surplus market is the 100 mW (rated) version, the C315M-100.  The output
power is tightly regulated so it generally will not change over the
laser's lifetime.  The maximum user adjustable power may be set by
one of the pots on the laser head itself, and during use by a simple
easily constructed control panel.  There is no modulation capability
though and the time for the output power to stabilize after being changed
may be up to a minute or more.
<p>
There is also a Coherent Compass 415M which is higher power (versions up to
at least 300 mW) but bears much similarity to the C315M.  However, it was
never claimed to be single frequency.  It uses a slightly different and
somewhat larger controller (though the same user interface/control panel
will work), and the laser head itself is a somewhat different shape.  The
head PCB which includes the "personality" settings for the laser is more
complex and mounted under a cover rather than exposed as with the C315M
(see below) but it's possible that the actual internal wiring of the head
is the same.  At least there are the same number of pins going inside
though the interface cable has more pins (37 instead
of 25).  See the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc415h">C415M
Laser Head</A> for more info.  Most references to the C415M have now
disappeared from the Coherent Web site as it is no longer being
manufactured.
<p>
The other laser in the original Compass-M family is the C215M, a lower power
version, up to 75 mW.  It is much more similar to the C315M than
the C415M but the controller is definitely not the same and has a lower
maximum rating for power consumption.  The overall system is probably
somewhat less expensive as some components have been left out compared
to a similarly-rated C315M.  I have tested a C215M-75 laser head on both
C215M and C315M controllers and it works fine.  But whether the stability
and efficiency are the same with the C315M controller is not known, though
I'd expect them to be similar.
<p>
Due to the method of construction, all three of these lasers should retain
alignment for their entire life.  Everything internally is fastened by
glue or solder with no screws anywhere.  A fall onto a concrete floor
may break internal parts and ruin the laser but normal shipping won't
affect anything.
<p>
In 2005, Coherent has added a C115M laser to its product line.  This is
a low power (5 or 10 mW) laser which uses a very different design.  It
has obviously been cost reduced (the blurb even says so), as the controller
isn't even in an enclosed case, just either a PCB that fits over the laser
head or attaches to it with a cable.  Given the configuration of the laser
head, I'd guess the C115M has a more conventional cavity design than the other
Compass-M lasers but haven't seen one in person.  There is no mention of
single frequency operation, so it is probably multimode.
<p>
And, if you happen across a truckload of junked lithosetters, rumor has it that
one machine that contains C315M lasers is the Agfa Galileo, which is an
"older" model as these things go.  Newer ones are now using violet laser
diodes. :)
<p>
As of 2006, there is a Coherent C561 laser operating at 561 nm (a
greenish yellow) which appears to use the C315M design but with different
mirror coatings and SHG crystal (or just phase matching angle).  Nd:YAG
has a lasing line at 1,122 nm which is much weaker than the 1,064 nm line and
the highest power is only 20 mW at present, but hopefully that will improve. :)
<p>
Photos of the C315M and C415 construction (and dissection of the C315M) can
be found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
(Version 1.94 or higher) under "Coherent Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers".
<p>
These laser heads used to show up on eBay and elsewhere for as little as
$300 for the C315M, somewhat more for the higher power and less common C415M.
But should you find a carton full of laser heads, some caution is advised
before buying a dozen if they don't come with the
Coherent Analog Controller.  For the C315M, in addition to the pump diode,
there are three (3) sets of TE coolers (a pair for the pump diode, one for
the KTP, and another pair for the overall cavity) that need to be controlled
independently for optimum performance.  It may be possible to power just
the pump diode and its TEC but depending on the particular unit, the output
power and stability may be substantially reduced.  In the unit for which some
of the photos were taken, it happened that full output power was produced
without even bothering to cool the diode (at least for long enough to take
the pics - definitely not advised for continuous operation!).  However,
getting decent output power is not guaranteed without tuning the temperature
of the KTP.  In fact, there may be little or no green output at all for some
samples (though this is not common)!
<p>
However, as of 2006, the availability of the laser heads by themselves seems
to have gone way down, though complete systems, while not plentiful, can still
be found.  Possibly, the entire print engines in which the Compass-M lasers
were used are now being replaced by newer technology like violet laser diodes.
So the heads pulled alone are no longer trickling in from field service.
Expect to spend between $1,000 and $2,000 for a C315M-100 system, about $500
more for a C315M-150 system, and $2,500 or more for a complete C415M-200 system
(which is very uncommon now surplus and no longer in production).  Some
lower power C215M and C315M systems also show up occasionally.
<p>
If buying a surplus C315M, try to get the heatsink and output optics unit that
usually goes with it.  This includes a half wave plate mounted in the
center of a large brass gear that may be rotated to select an arbitrary
polarization orientation of the output beam.  The waveplate itself is about
5x5x1 mm and AR coated on both sides and can be removed from the gear if you
don't want to retain the entire assembly.  I drilled a hole in the dust
cap (that often comes with these lasers) and glued the waveplate to it at
a slight angle (to prevent back-reflections).  The cap will stay put but is
easily rotated to set the polarization orientation.  Using a Polarizing
BeamSplitter (PBS) for testing, the extinction ratio (max:min intensity)
could be determined as the waveplate was rotated.  It was greater than 200:1
for transmission and greater than 50:1 for reflection even though my PBS was
designed for 633 nm rather than 532 nm.
<p>
The original complete assembly has many interesting and useful parts including
high quality optics and stepper motors for computer control of beam focus,
size, and fine alignment (computer not included), but these are only very
rarely available.  See <A HREF="c315mop1.jpg">Photo of Typical C315M Optics
Platform from Platesetter</A> for one example.  The spinner motor with its 45
degree mirror can operate at 30,000 rpm or more, but the drivers for it as
well as the other stepper motors, are generally not provided, or useful if
they are since there is no documentation.
<p>
But be aware that the C315M uses a small YAG rod (not vanadate) with a separate
HR mirror and a very small KTP crystal.  The C415M uses a Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>
(vanadate) crystal also with a separate HR mirror and very small KTP
crystal.  None of the parts is particularly useful for a home-built DPSS
project so buying one of these lasers just to salvage parts is probably
ill-advised.  In addition, while the pump diode for the C315M is in a
nice package with a GRIN lens on its output, it is not set up for a
very small pump beam spot as would be required
in a typical home-built green DPSS laser using a (relatively thin) vanadate
crystal.  The C415M uses external pump beam shaping optics which are mounted
separately from the pump diode package itself.  The optics in both cases
(HR and OC) are also matched to the C315M and C415M cavity configuration.
Thus, any home-built laser using these parts would have to retain the
cavity design so best to just leave it intact!
<p>
The Coherent Analog Controller is a set of programmable drivers that
implements an initialization/search algorithm to determine an optimal
set of operating parameters based on the selected output power and
laser head personality PCB.  It can plug into any sample of a compatible
Compass-M laser head and find near-optimal operating conditions in under
6 minutes.  This might take over an hour to do by hand using lab drivers.
<p>
The warmup using the Coherent Analog Controller is similar to other DPSS
lasers in that's it's not a smooth ramp up to full power and will have
wild fluctuations for a few minutes.  It's not as bad as some but significant
"fluffing and pulsing" of
the output occurs as the unit initializes and goes through its search and
optimization algorithm.  See <A HREF="c315m1-1.gif">C315M DPSS Laser Normal
Startup</A>.  After a few second time delay, they turn on with
a ramp (0 to around 50 percent power), then the fluffing/pulsing until the
output power decreases slightly, and then increases to full power and
becomes very stable and BRIGHT! :)  (There's a Ready status signal that
is asserted once the warmup is complete.)  However, note that changing
power can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes for stability
to return.  It is usually shorter than initial warmup but never instantaneous.
Thus, these lasers cannot be modulated in any useful way using
the Coherent controller.  The same power plot extended to include three
new power settings after initial warmup is shown in
<A HREF="c315m1-2.gif">C315M DPSS Laser Startup Followed by 25, 60, and 100
Percent Power Settings</A>.
<p>
Noise in the output in the frequency range of 0 to 20 MHz is very low,
probably below 1 percent for the units I tested.

<h3><A NAME="sclcomcc">Quick Comparison of Coherent Compass 532 and
 Compass-M Lasers</A></h3>

Both of these lasers produce green light at 532 nm and the beam is TEM00 and
single frequency (single longitudinal mode) so what's the difference?
You'll have to read the sections on both lasers for a more complete
picture but here's a brief summary.
<p>
From an elegance perspective, the C532 might be considered a superior laser
since it uses a ring-type resonator with automagical adjustment to optimize
the lasing mode location, and enables instant power output adjustment
but not true high speed modulation.  But it's also a more complex laser
in terms of the optical layout, and usually more expensive, new or surplus.
The Compass-M lasers use a more traditional Fabry-Perot resonator design
with multiple mode selection elements to force single mode operation.
<p>
The controller board for the C532 is matched to the laser head so that
switching heads (to the extent that this is really feasible) requires
complete realignment.  Particularly troublesome may be adjusting the
mode stabilization circuits.  On the plus side, the C532 controller
uses mostly off the shelf parts and schematics are available.  And,
replacement of some parts inside the laser head (e.g., the pump diode)
are possible, though not necessarily easy.
<p>
The Coherent Analog Controller for each series of Compass-M lasers (C215M,
C315M, or C415M) is very reliable and any controller should work with any
compatible laser head with no adjustments as head specific LD and TEC
settings are read from the laser head "personality" PCB and the controller
then determines optimal operating parameters during initialization.
Thus, any C315M laser head (e.g., -50, -100, -150) will operate correctly
with any C315M controller.  Same for the C215M and C415M but except for
possibly being able to run a C215M laser head on a C315M controller, they
are not interchangeable.  (While running a C215M laser head on a C315M
controller seems to work at least in one instance, there are no guarantees
it will work in all cases.)  However, no service information is available
for any of the controllers and except for some simple problems, for all
practical purposes, the Compass-M laser heads are not serviceable at all.
<p>
In terms of beam characteristics, the beam profile of all samples of the
C315M (or C215M or C415M) is virtually identical, nicely circular and
Gaussian.  This probably derives from the robotic assembly line resulting
in a very high degree of consistency from one unit to the next.  The
beam from a C532 is less consistent varying from perfectly circular to
significantly elongated (usually vertically).  Both lasers are linearly
polarized vertically.
<p>
Both lasers should be good for holography and interferometry.  However,
since the C532 is a unidirection ring laser, it's virtually guaranteed
to be single mode and have long coherence length.  The C315M is single
mode under most conditions, though not guaranteed by the resonator
configuration.  As a practical matter it probably doesn't matter.

<h3><A NAME="sclcpsmc">Differences Between the C215M, C315M, and C415M</A></h3>

Here are some observations comparing the C215M, C315M, and C415M laser
heads and the C215M, C315M, and C415M analog controllers external and
operational characteristics.  Basic electrical and mechanical specifications
for the C215M and C315M may be found via the Coherent, Inc., link, above.
(The C415M is no longer manufactured.)  Descriptions of the internal
design may be found in the respective sections for each laser.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The C415M analog controller is longer than the one for the C315M
 which is thicker than the one for the C215M.
<p>
<li>The controller-to-head cable for the C415M is a DB37 at both ends
 instead of a DB25 at the controller and 30 pin SIL at the head for the
 C215M and C315M.  The connector for the digital controller is different
 as well.
<p>
<li>The C415M head is made of something that looks like
 stainless steel (though perhaps it's really plated magnesium or some
 alloy, being quite light in weight and relatively soft).  It has a
 machined (milled) finish with a recessed soldered lid.  The C215M head
 is also of milled construction with a recessed lid like the C415M and
 some are made of a similar material, while newer ones are gold plated.  The
 C315M is made of gold plated welded sheet steel and has a much lower
 quality look and feel with the (often somewhat sloppily) soldered
 lid basically sitting on top.  The C415M laser head is also shorter
 in height, but wider and longer than the C215M and C315M, which are
 identical in size and have the same mounting hole locations.
<p>
<li>The C415M head PCB is installed inside a covered compartment rather than
 being exposed as it is in the C215M and C315M.  It is also more complex.
 However, the actual connections feeding through to the interior of the
 head are both 30 pins.  I don't know how many of the signals are the same
 or are on the same pins though.  The C215M and C315M seem to have the
 same PCB functions and wiring except for the C215M's total lack of the
 RES TEC and upper LD TEC.  The P3 pot and associated components are also
 not present on some unit.  The pin for the RES thermistor is jumpered
 to the pin for the LD thermistor inside the laser head.
<p>
<li>The C415M analog controller has a spec'd input voltage of 24 VDC +/-5%,
 5 A max.  The C315M will operate on 12 to 28 VDC, 150 W max (though a
 sticker on newer C315M controllers says: 12 to 24 VDC).  The C215M
 analog controller runs on 5 VDC +/-5%, 40 W max.  (But the C215M laser head
 will also run on the C315M controller although it's not known if the
 efficiency and stability is as good as with the proper controller.)
<p>
<li>The C415M takes longer for initial laser light to appear once the laser
 is turned on - perhaps 30 seconds compared to under 10 seconds typical
 for the C315M and C215M.  However, warmup at least for the C415M sample I
 tested, was very fast - under 2 minutes to full power.  Warmup for the 
 C215M is also under 2 minutes, but it has much less to do, lacking any
 control of RES temperature.
<p>
<li>The C215M is virtually identical to the C315M inside, except for the
 lack of the RES TEC and lack of the upper LD TEC.  There is no separate
 RES thermistor since the LD and RES are a single plate, and the pin for
 the RES thermistor is connected to the pin LD thermistor (pins 5 to 8).
 You might not notice any differences inside by just taking
 a photo with the cover removed.  The C415M head is constructed using the same
 solder blob mounting scheme as the C215M and C315M but is somewhat more
 complex.  It uses Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate) instead of Nd:YAG with
 more sophisticated pump beam correction optics and a cavity about twice as
 long.  However, unlike the C315M (and perhaps C215M), there is no cover over
 the cavity holding the green filter and intracavity stops -
 everything is mounted on the substrate holding the other cavity components.
 Like the C315M, there is a separate substrate for the laser diode (and its
 pump optics).
<p>
<li>Something inside the C415M laser heads rattle slightly when shaken.  This
 is present to a varying degree on all four C415M heads I've seen including
 one that appears to be brand new and exceeds original specs.  Shaking the
 laser while lasing results in no effect on the beam so whatever is rattling
 can't be part of the beam path.  I've removed the cover on one head which
 had what sounded more like a bowling ball rolling around inside.  The bowling
 ball turned out to be the vanadate crystal in its metal carrier which had
 broken lose from the solder blob mount.  Nothing else I can see should make
 any noise when shaken yet even this head still has a slight rattle after
 gluing the vanadate back in place.  It now lases, though possibly is
 low power due to a damaged pump diode or some other unrelated problem.  I do
 not have a controller to test it so there is no way to know for sure.  With
 the small number of C415M laser heads available surplus, it doesn't seem
 worthwhile to go to all of the trouble of figuring out the head wiring
 and constructing a cable harness to power it from a lab controller.
 And the C415M is no longer manufactured.
<p>
 I found that pressing on the external PCB seems to reduce or eliminate
 the rattle so I'm now convinced that it is likely an insulator or spacer
 under the PCB and not something inside the laser compartment itself.
</ul>
<p>
What's the same?  Well, the same control panel or autostart board can be
used on the analog controller's DB15 interface connector for all three
lasers! :)

<h3><A NAME="sclcpsmu">Using the Coherent Analog Controller</A></h3>

This section provides complete information on turning the C315M laser on and
off, setting output power, and monitoring status via the DB15 user interface
connector on the analog controller.  The same controller can generally be
used for C315M heads with different maximum power ratings equal to or less
than its rating (e.g., a -100 controller can be used with a -50 or -100
laser head).  I have had no serious problems using a -100 controller with
-150 laser heads but have seen some minor quirks that could have been due to
the higher current required for some -150 laser heads near full power as
C315M-150 lasers may have a diode current limit approaching 3 amps.
Cooling of the controller baseplate will be more critical for higher
power lasers.
<p>
The selected power will always be based on a percentage of the maximum as far
as the DB15 user interface connector is concerned (though there may be
differences in data returned via the Coherent Digital Controller since there's
a parameter for maximum laser power that can be sent to it.
<p>
The information below applies directly to the C315M analog controller but
the C215M and C415M analog controller user interface connector functions
appear to be very similar or identical, and the same autostart adapter and/or
control panel should operate all types.  (However, the higher power C415M - up
to 300 mW - requires a different analog controller which operates ONLY on
24 VDC and the analog controller for the C215M operates ONLY on 5 VDC.
In addition, there is a 2 pin jumper on the C215M controller which enables
the laser to be started automatically without anything attached to the
DB15 user interface connector.)
<p>
WARNING: The C315M analog controller (at least) is apparently not as well
protected against failure from external causes as might be expected from
something this sophisticated (and expensive!):
<p>
<ul>
<li>To construct the user control panels described below, external circuitry
 must be attached to the DB15M connector.  Pin 11 is a source of +5 VDC
 which is required for various functions.  It's quite possible that there
 is NO overcurrent protection inside the controller and catastrophic failure
 may occur if the spec'd 200 mA rating is exceeded.  Even if the +5 VDC source
 isn't damaged, a short circuit may cause enough current to flow to blow open
 a ground trace on the controller PCB.  Once this happens, current tries to
 find another path and may fry the interface IC and possibly other vital
 organs.  And once this happens, the controller can do almost anything it
 wants including burning out the laser head.
<p>
 The user should provide current limiting and/or a fast blow fuse to guard
 against unfortunate accidents.  Install a fast acting fuse (IC protector)
 in series with the +5 VDC.  The Interlock input draws about 100 mA to drive
 a relay directly so the lowest value fuse rating that can be used is probably
 200 mA unless the Interlock and logic have their own fuses in which case
 125 mA and 65 mA, respectively, should work.  I recommend placing the fuse
 or fuses inside the connector shell of the DB15F you attach to the
 controller.  This will then protect against shorts in the cable as well.
 Alternatively or in addition, current limiting resistors (e.g., 25 ohms or
 more) can be installed in series with any circuits using the +5 VDC (except
 Interlock) if they won't affect functionality of control panel switches and
 LEDs or other indicators.  See the suggestions in the schematic of the
 control panel I constructed, <A HREF="315cpnl1.gif">C315M Laser Control
 Panel 1</A>.
<p>
 However, note that low current fast blow fuses may have
 several ohms of resistance.  If the control panel draws more than a
 few mA (as it would with a bunch of LEDs!), this would affect the output
 of the power set pot enough to cause a noticeable reduction in maximum output
 power as a function of how many LEDs are lit!  What I recommend is sending a
 separate +5 VDC feed to the top of the pot either via another fast blow fuse
 or just a 20 ohm fusable resistor (which would cause only a 0.2% reduction
 in the power setting).  Or, you can get fancy and install something like a
 MAXIM MAX233 or 555 timer with a voltage doubler to create a boost voltage
 along with a resistor and 5 V zener or 78L05 to recreate a stable +5 VDC
 reference for the pot. :)
<p>
<li>While the spec allows for input voltages from 12 VDC to 28 VDC, it may
 be best to use something in between to provide some margin for voltage
 accuracy and drop in the cable.  Low voltage increases current through
 the cables and chopper MOSFETs; high voltage increases stress on the
 MOSFETS.  I'd suggest 15 VDC as a reasonable compromise though it probably
 doesn't really matter that much.  A power rating of 150 W is spec'd by
 Coherent but I've been running on both 15 VDC, 5 A and 12 VDC, 6.6 A power
 supplies without problems.  The 150 W rating would be a worst case with the
 LD and TECs running full tilt at maximum ambient temperature.  Suitable power
 supplies can be obtained for under $50 from places like
 <A HREF="http://www.mpja.com/">Marlin P. Jones</A>.  They are also
 commonly available on eBay.  The only caution is that for switchmode
 power supplies, a minimum load may be required on the regulated output
 (where there are multiple outputs) if not enough in addition to the laser
 is being powered from the supply.  This is typically 5 to 10 percent
 of the rated current on that output.  Since the Coherent controller
 draws minimal current until the laser is turned on, an additional load
 may be needed to maintain stability.  This can be a suitable power
 resistor or possibly something like an automotive tail light lamp.
<p>
<li>Make sure the wiring for the main power feed to the controller is made
 with adequate size conductors (#14 AWG or bigger) to assure that under
 maximum load, the input voltage doesn't drop below 12 VDC.
<p>
<li>Make sure all connections are secure before attempting to apply power.
<p>
<li>Provide adequate heatsinking and cooling for both the controller and
 laser head.  The standard heatsink provided with the C315M laser head
 may not be sufficient for some units without some forced-air cooling.
 A thin layer of thermal grease (heatsink compound) or indium foil between
 the heatsink and bottom of the laser head is recommended.  The dissipation
 of the controller is relatively low so this probably isn't needed for it
 but won't hurt.  Do not overtighten the mounting screws in either case.
<p>
<li>When swapping laser heads or changing any wiring, power down
 completely by removing AC power and waiting ample time for the DC
 power to decay to 0 V.  I've seen strange behavior at least once if
 this wasn't done.  (I would expect that interrupting the interlock
 would be equivalent but don't know for sure so play it safe.)
<p>
 Adding a "power-on" LED to the power supply if none is already present
 is recommended so that it will be obvious when DC power is present
 and non-zero before changing connections.
<p>
<li>If any unusual behavior is observed, power down IMMEDIATELY and attempt
 to determine what is wrong.  Unusual behavior includes indicator lights
 not doing what is expected, no laser output within a few seconds of
 switching on the Laser Diode (see below), weak laser output, etc.  If
 the controller fails to achieve the laser output power selected, it may
 continue to increase laser diode current until the laser diode is damaged
 or destroyed.  I don't know if this is considered normal behavior but
 certainly has been known to happen.  For example, if the thermal control
 fails to operate properly, laser power will never reach anything near
 rated power and this may occur.  The C315M Operator's Manual claims the
 laser diode is very well protected against overcurrent and this is probably
 true in most cases, but not all cases. :(
</ul>
<p>
The C315M Operator's Manual makes no specific mention of some of the above
but I know of at least two instances of controller failure for unknown
reasons so it makes sense to heed these warnings.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315y">Single Point Failure Mode of the C315M Analog
 Controller</A></h4>

The following applies from personal experience to the C315M analog controller.
Since the C415M analog controller has a similar interface, it's quite possible
that the failure mode applies to it as well.
<p>
Although this unit is supposed to have a variety of safeguards to prevent
damage to the laser diode from overcurrent, or the TECs or what they are
attached to from overtemperature, and appears to be fairly robust overall,
there is one very fundamental flaw that can result in the destruction of the
attached laser head.  This is a result of a single point failure in the
GAL16V8D PLD which attaches to the 15 pin user interface connector (among
other things).  The GAL part's inputs are the user switches, status and fault
signals from other parts of the controller.  Its outputs enable the TEC and
LD power and provide the user status signals.
<p>
The failure may arise if this GAL is damaged or forgets its programming (these
are reprogrammable parts so in theory at least, such amnesia is possible).  One
scenario which I unfortunately had occur is that an accidental short of the
+5 VDC line (pin 11 of the interface connector) to digital ground (pin 9) blew
open a trace on the PCB next to the connector and in the process, somehow
affected the GAL chip causing it to lose its mind.  At this point, the laser
diode was turned on (ignoring the associated switch) with no thermal control
(despite that switch being on) and no fail-safe protection against overcurrent
or overtemperature (contrary to what the operator's manual says).  I don't
know which part in the laser head died but within a couple of minutes, output
power decreased and then there was no lasing at all - ever.  With no status
indications functional, there was no way to be aware of this sequence of
events until it was too late.  The PCB trace was easily found and fixed but
the GAL remained brain dead.  Post mortem testing of the signals on the GAL
part showed that indeed, it completely ignores the user switches - pins 14
(Laser Status), 15 (Laser Diode Overcurrent), and 16 (Power Status), are all
stuck high.  Although the GAL pins are fairly well protected from transients
with series resistors, bypass caps, and the like, sharing critical functions
with the user interface, exposed as it is to abuse, was a basic design flaw.
These functions should have been in a separate section of circuitry isolated
to a greater extent from the outside world.  Thus, pay close attention to the
WARNINGS below when using the controller.
<p>
It's also possible that the GAL device failure was only collateral damage
and the actual problem was the open Ground.  Why?  Because even if the
laser diode remained on when it shouldn't have and was driven as hard as
possible via the controller, the actual current would still be limited to
the Imax for the diode because the P2 pot on the C315M laser head is what
determines its maximum current.  Thus even if the driving signal was at its
maximum value, the current control to the laser diode driver would still be
limited to Imax.  However, if the open ground also affected the laser head
itself, that P2 pot would no longer have its low side reference and the
current control signal could go to the actual maximum of the laser diode
driver which is much greater than Imax for most pump diodes.
<p>
Yet another possibility is that thermal control wasn't working or wasn't
working properly, particularly for the laser diode and it was damaged not
by overcurrent but by excessive temperature.  I did find the lower LD TEC
open on this laser head but that might have happened later.
<p>
I have now replaced the bad GAL part with one from another dead controller.
Getting it out more or less intact wasn't high on my list of fun things to do
on a lazy afternoon - it's in a socket now. :)  As far as I can tell by testing
the controller with the destroyed laser head while monitoring supply current,
the GAL appears to have been the only casualty.  However, since the replacement
was from a unit with a different revision code, I don't know for sure that its
logic is identical.  I finally risked testing the repaired controller with a
good laser head.  It appears to work fine and I've since used it to test
dozens of C315M laser heads but there still could be subtle differences
due to a possible earlier GAL revision.  However, I've been using this controller
to test various C315M laser heads without any problems.

<h4><A NAME="sclcpsma">Analog Controller User Interface Signals</A></h4>

Here are the descriptions of the connections to the DB15M user interface.
As noted, the C415M interface is similar or identical.
<p>
These are paraphrased from the C315M Operator's Manual:
<p>
<b>Pin 1 - Interlock.</b>  The laser turns on only if this pin is connected
 to +5 VDC (for example, via a door switch).  Opening the interlock loop turns
 the laser off immediately.  After reconnection of the interlock loop, there
 is a three second delay before the laser is restarted.  +5 VDC is available on
 pin 11.  Current consumption of the interlock relay is approximately 100 mA.
<p>
<b>Pin 2 - Laser On/Off (Command).</b> The rising edge of this TTL signal
 turns the laser diode on and it must remain high while the laser is
 operating.  The laser diode will be disabled if pin 6 (Power On/Off Status)
 is low.
<p>
<b>Pin 3 - Power On/Off (Thermal Control, Command).</b> The rising edge of this
 TTL signal turns on all thermal control loops (but not the laser diode).  It
 must remain high during operation.
<p>
<b>Pin 4 - Laser (Status).</b> A TTL output (high=on) that can be used
 to monitor the status of the laser diode and hence the laser.
<p>
<b>Pin 5 - Laser Diode Overcurrent (Status).</b> A TTL output (high=fault)
 indicates a serious malfunction and should NEVER occur during normal
 operation.  It is intended as a troubleshooting aid.
<p>
<b>Pin 6 - Power On/Off (Status).</b> A TTL output (high=on) that indicates
 the status of the Thermal Control components.  The laser diode cannot be
 turned on if this signal is low.
<p>
<b>Pin 7 - Overtemperature (Status).</b> A TTL output (high=fault) indicates
 that the thermalized components probably including the LD, KTP, and RES,
 are too hot and the laser will shut down.  It may be
 restarted once it has cooled down.  (Power On/Off and Laser On/Off must
 be cycled to reset.)  Unless there is a fault in the wiring or an internal
 short circuit, or a defective controller, it's not clear how this could
 happen unless the baseplate temperature were also marginal.
<p>
<b>Pin 8 - Enter (Command).</b> This TTL signal must be pulled down for at
 least 1 ms to transfer the setting of the power level pot to the internal
 memory and initiate a new power search cycle.
<p>
<b>Pin 9 - Digital Ground.</b> 
<b>Pin 10 - Analog Ground.</b> Analog and Digital Grounds are tied together
 inside the controller.
<p>
<b>Pin 11 - +5 VDC Source.</b> This output provides power to the digital
 controller and can be used for user circuitry attached to the 15 pin
 interface.  The maximum current that can be taken safely from pin 11 is
 200 mA.  See the warnings above about this pin.
<p>
<b>Pin 12 - Heat Sink Overtemperature (Status).</b> This TTL output
 (high=fault) indicates that the case temperature is too high for the
 internal TECs to function properly.  The laser will shut down and may be
 restarted once the laser has cooled down.  A larger heatsink, more fans,
 or lower ambient temperature will be required.
<p>
<b>Pin 13 - Laser Power Setpoint.</b> This analog signal ranges from 0 to
 +5 V corresponding to a selected power from 0 to the maximum spec'd power
 for the laser.  (Note that there is some conflicting information as to the
 range as elsewhere, it says it is from 50 to 100 percent of rated power.)
 This value must be entered into the controller's nonvolatile memory to become
 active.

<b>Pin 14 - Power Monitor Output.</b> Output voltage of 0 to 5 V indicates
 laser power from 0 to maximum spec'd value.  For accurate power readings,
 it will be necessary to calibrate this signal with respect to calibrated
 reference.
<p>
<b>Pin 15 - Laser Ready (Status).</b> This TTL signal goes high when the actual
 output power is within a window of the selected output power.  Thus, it
 may flash on momentarily during the search procedure while the laser is
 warming up.  The laser can be assumed to have stabilized if this signal
 remains on for more than 30 seconds.

<h4><A NAME="sclcpsmx">Compass-M Laser Control Panels</A></h4>

The following are known to be compatible with the Coherent Analog Controllers
for the C215M, C315M, and C415M lasers.
<p>
The absolutely most minimal hardware needed to turn on the C315M and C415M
lasers at full power can be constructed by hardwiring pins 1, 3, and 13 to
pin 11 (+5 VDC).  Install a 1K ohm resistor between pin 11 and pin 2.  Jumper
pins 9 and 10 together (digital and analog GND) and add a 47 uF capacitor
from pin 2 (+) and pin 9 (-).  The RC network is needed to provide a delay
between Power On and Laser On.  Add a momentary switch between pins 8 and 9
to set the power to max.  (The switch is only needed to load the power setting
the first time a new laser head/controller combination is powered up.  After
that, the power setting is retained in the Controller's EEPROM.)
<p>
Even this minimal setup isn't needed for the C215M controller since there
is a jumper that enables automatic start up at full power without anything
connected to the user interface DB15.  The jumper position is to the right
of the DB15 connector.  CAUTION: There is also a two pin header next to the
power connector, function unknown - DON'T put a jumper there!
<p>
What follows are several control panels and related circuits starting with one
that's just barely more complex than the one just described:
<p>
Note that all of these use the +5 VDC output from the controller for power.
However, for the Power Set pot in particular, it may be better to provide
an external well regulated source of 5 VDC, or to boost the 5 VDC from the
controller and then re-regulate it back down to +5 VDC.  The reason is that
there appears to be a fair amount of ripple and noise on this line with
variations long enough that filtering isn't possible.  Thus, the actual
power setting stored by the controller can vary by a few percent depending
on when the button is pressed.  A boost supply just for the Power Set pot
can be constructed using something like a Maxim MAX232 charge pump or
a 555-based doubler followed by a 78L05 regulator.
<p>
Another quirk is that the Power Set pushbutton behaves a bit strangely
while depressed but only under certain as yet not quite defined
conditions, at least for some controllers.  If depressed and released,
operation is exactly as expected.  But if depressed and held, the genuine
Coherent Autostart resets to 0 output and stays there.  On my Control Panel 2
and my autostart widgets, if the laser was stabilized with READY lit,
it may change the output power by a few percent but remain READY and
re-stabilize at the new power level.  At first I thought it was contact
bounce on the pushbutton, but while that does seem to have an effect,
it's not the only issue.  This behavior occurs even when exactly the
same power up sequence is used as described in the C315M manual and.  And
the Power Set pushbutton is just an SPST switch in all cases!  But as it
turns out, the Coherent Autostart also pulls Laser On low while the
pushbutton is depressed.  This turns off the laser diode and thus
restarts search or ramp-up from 0 mW.  It is not documented anywhere
as far as I can tell and may simply be a fortuitous accident of the
design, as it uses a sneak path (the body diode of the MOSFET used to
pull the Power Set line low during the power-up sequence) to also pull
Laser On low when the pushbutton is pressed.  So, this is an area of
undocumented behavior.  However, I have found no situation where
either the laser head or controller could be damaged from an elephant
sitting on the Power Set pushbutton. :)
<p>
<b>Basic Control Panel:</b>
<p>
(Much of this is from: Dave (ws407c@aol.com).)
<p>
For those lucky enough to get or have a Coherent power unit, here are the
connections on the 15 pin connector required to operate the laser.  This
allows the output power to be adjusted from less than 1 mW to 100 mW using
a pot and is based on the <A HREF="315tst1.jpg">C315M Test Connector</A>
(available from Coherent no doubt at an exorbitant price) which sets up the
laser for variable power.  To make your own, wire a DB15 female connector
as shown below and attach it before applying power.

<p>
Not shown but highly recommended: A 250 mA fast acting fuse between pin 11
and everything else to protect against shorts to the Controller's internal
+5 VDC supply.
<p>
You will need 2 SPST toggle switches (Interlock is optional and can just
be a jumper between the two pins), a 10K ohm pot (linear taper), 1 SPST 
normally open momentary switch, and of course the DB15 female connector
to attach these to the controller.  In addition, to monitor status, a
logic inverter as shown or just a 2N3904 transistor with a 10K base reisstor
will be needed to drive an LED.
LED
<p>
The relative output power can be monitored on pin 14 (0 to 5 V).  Adding an
analog or digital panel meter would complete a really classy C315M control
panel. :)  (However, note that the output power is not absolute but simply
relative to the maximum control panel pot setting (+5 VDC).  The P6 pot on
the laser head adjusts actual output power as well but that won't show up
via pin 14.)
<p>
Watch out for static especially with the controller unit! The controller
unit also needs to be heatsinked for it dissipates about 15 W.  An aluminum
finned heatsink about the same size as the controller should be adequate.
If it gets more than just warm to the touch, a small fan should be added.
<p>
Note that the Compass-M laser heads may dissipate substantial power during
initialization when the TECs are being driven to the temperature setpoints
and when running at anywhere near full power, and MUST be kept cool.  The
plain heatsink provided with many of these systems is not sufficient
without some forced-air cooling.  I'd recommend a 6x6 inch or more
finned heatsink, preferably with a cooling fan.
At low power (say less than 10 mW) this may not be essential but it's good
insurance.  And, as noted, during initialization, the baseplate could get
hot enough to cause the laser to shut down if there is no heatsink.
The baseplate should not be more than warm to the touch (27 &deg;C, 81 &deg;F)
even after extended operation.
<p>
Turn on is as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Close switch "I" (Interlock).
<li>Apply DC power to the system.
<li>Push momentary switch "E" to load power level setpoint into the register.
<li>Close switch "T" (Thermoelectric Control).
<li>Close switch "L" (Laser Diode).
</ol>
<p>
Yellow LED on the head comes on and laser will come on and eventually
settle at the power set on the pot.  Note that the output power may go
through some wild gyrations during this time, especially from a cold start,
as the controller performs some rather complex optimization.  This
is nothing to be worried about as long as it eventually stabilizes.  How long
the entire process takes may vary with the particular laser head, selected
output power, and ambient temperature, but is typically 1 to 6 minutes.
(More on what goes on below.)
<p>
When the laser has reached stability at the selected power, the "ready/stable" 
output will switch to a TTL "HI" on pin 15, (lower rightmost pin on connector o
as you look at it on the controller unit).
<p>
Do not directly drive anything like an LED with the controller outputs -
buffer them.  This is particularly true of the Ready signal.  A load like
a 74HC input or a 10K ohm resistor to the base of a 2N3904 will be fine
but even a single 74LS TTL gate may be problematic.
<p>
While the laser is running you can change the power level at any time. Just 
set the pot to the new setting and push the "E" button.  The laser output
power will drop to a low value (perhaps go off entirely) and then climb to the
new setting (with possible gyrations in the process).  Stabilizing after
changing power may take a minute or so as only part of the optimization
process is performed.  The manual recommends that you run it at 60 to 100%
output power but for what reason I am not sure. Possibly for stability
for I have run mine at 5 to 10 mW for hours at a time without any noticeable
problems.  It runs cold at lower output.
<p>
To shut down, flip the Laser Diode switch "L" off and kill input power.
<p>
Please use these jumpers with caution.
<p>
An interesting note: When the laser is switched to standby mode it continuously
sends out in easily visible data packets, the total hours (most likely) via
the IR led on the back of the head.  This can easily be seen with the aid of
an IR sensor card or IR detector circuit.  The format looks like it might be a
stream of 8 to 10 characters.  It seems that if this repeating data
stream is recorded and the laser is then run for a specific amount of time the
code could be figured out but so far even after some modestly extensive
tests, the code remains a mystery. :)
<p>
<b>Simple Autostart Adapter:</b>
<p>
(For this and some of the other below, I have bare (unpopulated) printed
circuit boards and/or complete units available.  See:
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/sale/">Sam's Classified Page</A>
under "Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers".)
<p>
This is very similar to the basic control panel but will automatically power
up the laser at the power setting of the pot and allow the power to be
changed.  (Applying power to the Basic Control Panel with both switches on
*may* start the laser or may do nothing - it's sort of a crap shoot.  The
autostart adapter provides the proper timing.)

</PRE>
<p>
See <A HREF="c315mas1.jpg">Photo of C315M Simple Autostart Adapter</A>.
As can be seen, I have made a printed circuit board which can either be
used naked or if the corners are cut off, it will fit inside some DB15 shells
including this one which is <A HREF="http://www.jameco.com/">Jameco</A> part
number 25566CF (metallized), but their part number 15018CF (plastic) may be
safer as far as minimizing the risk of short circuits is concerned.  Some
assembly required.  The capacitor for the time delay from Power On to Laser On
is mounted under the PCB.  The parts marked with "*" are
to pulse the Enable line on power-up.  These were not in the original
version of the PCB but fit easily underneath as well.
As above, not shown but highly recommended: A 250 mA
fast acting fuse between pin 11 and everything else to protect against
shorts to the Controller's internal +5 VDC supply.
<p>
Note: The original design (V1.0 or AS1) of this circuit did NOT pulse the
Power Set line automatically.  With these, the C315M controller may not
perform a slow ramp-up of current from near zero but rather start at a
higher value based somehow on the state of the laser on the
previous power cycle.  This might seem surprising but isn't dangerous
for the laser and the end result appears to be just about the same
either way.  Such behavior happens more consistently when using
a 24 VDC power supply rather than the 12 to 15 VDC power supply but
may also occur with the lower voltage power supplies depending on
the revision of the controller, phase of the moon, even the particular
laser head, etc. :)  (Since the C215M and C415M controllers have fixed
power requirements, this doesn't apply to them.)  That some revisions
of the controller might behave
differently makes sense but why it should matter whether 24 VDC is used or 12
to 15 VDC is used is unknown.  Pressing the "Power Set" button soon
after applying power will always force a full initialization
and is recommended if the pulse circuit isn't included.  Adding just
a 4.7 uF capacitor across the pushbutton switch (call it V1.1 or AS2)
is sufficient under most conditions but is not guaranteed to perform
a full reset.
<p>
I also found that on one temperamental controller and only with a 24 VDC
DC power supply, both T and L must be delayed, so T should be wired to L
instead of +5V.  I assume this modification would work for all controllers
but haven't confirmed that.  I don't know if this is due to the particular
firmware revision, or just a sluggish interlock relay.  The genuine Coherent
Autostart has a delay for T of about 0.1 second followed by another similar
delay for L.  So, V1.2 or AS3 has this modification.
<p>
As noted above, the genuine Coherent Autostart adapter also pulls Laser On
low when pressing the Power Set pushbutton.  None of these (or any of
the control panels) do that, but such a feature could easily be added
to V1.1.  A diode (i.e., 1N4148) can be placed with its cathode to pin 8
and its anode to pin 2 to force Laser On low when the Power Set pushbutton
is depressed.  However, on V1.2, this will also force Power On low and thus
initiate a complete search procedure rather than just final ramp-up.
CAUTION: Double check that you haven't accidentally shorted to +5 VDC
(on pins 1 and pin 10 on V1.2, also on pin 3 on V1.1) as this will
result in bad things happening when the pushbutton is pressed!
<p>
<b>Slightly Better Control Panel:</b>
<p>
I've constructed the circuit below inside a little (antistatic) plastic box
with the salvaged backpanel-to-mainboard game port adapter from a defunct PC.
CAUTION: The wiring of these may not be standard - use an ohmmeter to confirm
pin association between the DB15F and IDC16 header.
See <A HREF="315p1pic.jpg">Photo of C315M Laser Control Panel 1</A>.
This has been tested on the C215M, C315M, and C415M.  The indicators
are an LED turned on by the "T" switch
and a status LED (not shown above) which flashes at about a 2 Hz rate when the
"L" switch is on but before the laser has stabilized and on solid when the
power level selected has been achieved is locked in.
See: <A HREF="315cpnl1.gif">C315M Laser Control Panel 1</A>.  (Note: This
updated version actually uses the logic confirmation of TC-On and LD-On for
the LEDs rather than the switches themselves.  Thus if the laser turns off
due to some fault, one or both LEDs will also go off.)  I have a few bare
(unpopulated) printed circuit boards available for this
control panel, though I'm not convinced using the PCB is much easier than
just constructing the circuit on a piece of prototyping "Perf" board.
Note: These do not designed to autostart - the switches should be sequenced
manually.
<p>
Note: Since the Power Set input has a resistance of only 10K ohms, the actual
power is NOT linear with pot rotation.  The non-linearity is reduced for
lower resistance pots but it may still be annoying even with a 1K ohm
pot, about the lowest resistance that should be used.  Therefore, where there
is no panel meter display of the power setting and a linear relationship is
desired, a unity gain buffer using a rail-to-rail 5 V op-amp like the
National LMC6482 should be added.
<p>
<b>Even Better Control Panel:</b>
<p>
And I have also made up a slightly more sophisticated control panel design
along with a PCB layout.  This should also work with the C215M, C315M,
and C415M lasers.  It includes all of the fault indicators in addition
to what's in <A HREF="315cpnl1.gif">C315M Laser Control Panel 1</A> as well as
initialization logic.  If S1, S2, and S3 are ON when power is applied, the
laser will automatically start up at the power level selected by the power
level pot.  This is based on the "Autostart Adapter" shown in the C315M
Operator Manual.  All it does is provide logic with delays to sequence the
required rising edges on Power On/Off (pin 3) and Laser On/Off (pin 2), and
the Enter pulse (pin 8) using some R/C delays and Schmitt-Trigger gates.
Unless you plan to bury your C315M inside some machine that may experience
power failures, autostart is probably an unneeded complication but I couldn't
resist. :)

<ul>
<li>C315M Laser Control Panel 2 Layout:
  <A HREF="315p2lay.gif">315p2lay.gif</A>.
</ul>
<p>
There is also another panel layout that adds monitoring of the laser diode
current and current control voltage, though such a capability would be more
useful for diagnostic purposes than simply running the laser.  The additional
inputs require connecting to three pins on the C215M or C315M laser head
cable: Pins 1 (Laser Diode Control), pin 2 (Laser Diode Current), and
pin 23 (Common).  While there should be corresponding signals
on the C415M as well, the laser head pin numbers will differ.
<p>
The internal beam pickup (monitor photodiode, pin 24) voltage may also be
monitored to keep track of how initialization is progressing and to check
how closely the laser maintains a constant output power.
<p>
An additional op-amp unity gain buffer or high value isolation resistor
(1M ohm or more) is recommended for each of the laser head signals,
especially for the laser diode control voltage and current to
prevent any switching transients from affecting laser diode operating.
<p>
And there is also an external input
for a power meter sensor so that actual output power can be monitored in
addition to the internal beam pickup of the laser head.  A silicon
photodiode behind a filter providing attenuation by a factor of
approximately 100 (OD2) is used to monitor output power
up to 199.9 mW.  With appropriate biasing, a voltage proportional to optical
power can be monitored across the load resistor so no additional op-amp
is needed.

</ol>
<p>
Of course, a multiposition meter select switch could have replaced the 2
position switch on Control Panel 2 but it's nice to be able to see
both current and output power simultaneously. :)  And, if LCD digital panel
meters are used, everything can be powered from the 5 VDC source on
the the DB15 user interface connector or laser head since their current
consumption is only 2 or 3 mA (compared to LED digital panel meters which
may require up to 200 mA or more).
<p>
<b>C315M Laser Diode/Output Power Monitor</b>
<p>
For just being able to display the laser diode current (LDI, pin 2), laser
diode current control voltage (LDCV, pin 1), internal beam pickup (Pin 24),
and actual laser output power, a much simpler unit can be constructed which
consists of 1 or 2 LCD Digital Panel Meters (DPMs) wired into the C315M (or
C215M) head connector with an external photodiode behind an ND2 or higher
neutral density filter.  This is essentially the monitoring portion of C315M
Laser Control Panel 3 and is what I finally constructed as I already had a
variety of control panels and autostart widgets.
<p>
I've built this monitor into a little aluminum box with switches to select
among LDI, LDCV, and output power using a 3-1/2 digit LCD DPM.  Power for the
DPM comes from the +5 VDC on the laser head PCB since it only requires 2 or 3
mA.  (An LED DPM draws a lot more current and might have required its own power
supply.)  Since the DPM has a full scale sensitivity of 200 mV, the op-amp
buffers were not needed as suitable high value resistors (over 10M ohm)
serve to calibrate the meter and provide isolation.  A portion of the
isolation/calibration resistance is located in the cable to the laser head.
For monitoring actual (external beam) power, my sensor is a 7 mm diameter
silicon photodiode (I have no idea where it came from) with a filter in
front of it to provide an attenuation of about OD2 (transmission of 1
percent) at 532 nm.  The load resistor and calibration adjustment is
a 500 ohm trimpot.  This rig tracks my LaserCheck within 1 or 2 percent.
<p>
The combination of Control Panel 1, Coherent Compass-M User Interface Signal
Monitor, and C315M Laser Diode/Output Power Monitor, is what I use most of
the time for testing and troubleshooting of C315M laser heads and controllers.
It's what I call the "C315M Diagnostic Unit" or CDU.  Here is a
<A HREF="315mdus1.jpg">Photo of C315M Diagnostic Unit Setup</A>.  The
signal monitor shows all green lights (no errors) and the output power
readout is 104.2 mW from one of my "visible" (Plexiglas top) C315M-100
laser heads. :)  See the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315du">Simplified C315M Laser Diagnostic Unit</A>.
<p>
<b>Compass-M User Interface Signal Monitor:</b>
<p>
I have also constructed a widget that goes in-line between the controller and
user control panel or other device which has LEDs on all the TTL inputs and
status signals.  See <A HREF="ccsmp1.jpg">Photo of Coherent Compass-M User
Interface Signal Monitor</A>  While this is not needed to operate the laser,
this comes in handy for troubleshooting should the controller not start
properly or shut down unexpectedly.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315ta">Test Adapters for the Coherent Analog
Controller</A>.

<h4><A NAME="sclcpsmp">Checklist for Powering a Compass-M System</A></h4>

The following assumes the use of the Coherent Analog Controller with a
ontrol panel that has adjustable power.  If some versions of the autostart
adapter are being used, some of the steps below will not be present.
This procedure is known to work for C215M, C315M, and C415M systems,
as well as a C215M laser head on a C315M controller.  For the special
case of a C315M laser head on a C215M, see the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315c2">Powering the C315M with the C215M
Analog Controller</A> since modifications are required for this to work
at all.
<p>
<b>Power and cooling requirements:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The DC power supply must be correct.  THEY ARE NOT THE SAME for the C215M,
 C315M, and C415M:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>C215M:</b> 5 VDC +/-5% <i>only</i>, 40 W max.  Applying more than
  5 VDC to a C215M controller will smoke it as the semiconductors sacrifice
  themselves to protect the internal 7 A fuse.
<p>
 <li><b>C315M:</b> 12 to 28 VDC +/-10%, 100 W max.  The power
  consumption listed in the C315M spec sheet is 100 W max and the recommended
  power supply rating is 150 W.  I think the maximum would only be needed
  under the worst case ambient conditions at maximum output power and
  possibly only momentary or a surge rating since there is a 10 A fuse
  in the input which implies 120 W max at 12 V.  Thus, something in
  between will probably suffice.  The power source can be either a
  linear or switchmode power supply or a pile of dry cells. :)  Or,
  you could run it from a fully charged 12 V auto battery (so the
  voltage doesn't drop below 12 V!).
<p>
  However, I've heard of power supplies that would have seemed to have
  adequate specifications resulting in erratic behavior.  For example,
  the laser shutting down shortly after the head LED or green output
  comes on.  I have used a 75 W (15 V, 5 A) switchmode power supply
  on dozens of C315M laser heads over hundreds of power cycles without
  any trouble, though an LED across the 15 VDC line does flicker with
  some specific C315M laser heads indicating a momentary power dip from
  excessive current.  I currently use an 80 W (12 V, 6.6 A) supply
  and haven't seen any problems either.  But, a power supply with at least
  a 100 W continuous rating is probably a good idea if you have a choice.
<p>
 <li><b>C415M:</b> 24 VDC +/-10% <i>only</i>, 125 W max.  The DC power supply
  provided by Coherent is rated 300 W!
 </ul>
<p>
<li>The laser head should be mounted on an adequate heatsink, preferably
 with forced air cooling.  If this is not done, during initial temperature
 stabilization, the case can get too hot to touch - hot enough to force the
 controller into thermal shutdown or to cycle the beam on and off - neither
 of which is likely to be good for the laser head.  The controller doesn't
 need a heatsink if running for just a few minutes but for any continuous
 operation, a heatsink is essential.
<p>
 Note: Some systems come with a fan-cooled heatsink.  If the fan connects
 to the C315M laser head, it runs off of the <i>raw</i> DC input power
 which can range from 12 to 28 VDC for the C315M.  However, there is a
 7812 regulator buried under the heatsink so the designers aren't as
 crazy as I thought at first since the fan itself states: 12 VDC (though
 the fan does run a bit slow with a 12 VDC input due to the voltage drop
 in the 7812. :)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Powering up/testing procedure:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the output window of the laser head is clean.  This should be
 done before it is turned on since the power density of the beam at the window
 is enough to decompose/vaporize/whatever anything placed on it.  Use a clean
 piece of lens tissue and some alcohol.  There will be almost no scatter
 from a clean window, but there is usually a faint ghost spot above the main
 beam.  This is normal.  If the laser head is mounted on the original heatsink
 with output polarization rotator, the half wave plate may also need to be
 cleaned.  Some disassembly required.
<p>
<li>Turn on DC power and interlock (if separate).
<p>
<li>Turn on the control panel Power On/Off switch (if present).
<p>
<li>Select the desired output power via the pot on the control panel or
 Autostart widget (if present).  If the laser will be operated at more than
 one output power setting without powering off, it is probably best to let it
 initialize at the highest setting since this determines the optimal
 operating parameters.  When initialized at low power but then changed to
 much higher power, I've seen behavior where the controller may overshoot
 the correct setting and never stabilize.
<p>
 If there is no power adjustment pot, the system can only be operated at
 full power.
<p>
<li>Press the Power Set button (even if not changing power) to reset the
 system.
<p>
<li>Turn on the control panel Laser On/Off switch (if present).  The yellow
 LED at the front of the laser should come on within a second or two.
<p>
<li>There should be some green output within at most 30 seconds, typical
 is 5 to 10 seconds.  If there is none, power down and figure out what's
 wrong!!!!
<p>
<li>During warmup, the laser output power will fluctuate but eventually
 it should settle down and be very stable.  A laser power meter can be
 used to determine the actual output power.  The typical behavior is shown
 in <A HREF="c315m1-1.gif">Power Outupt Plot of C315M DPSS Laser Startup</A>.
 Specifically:
<p>
 For the C315M (and probably the C415M), the output will gradually increase
 to about 50 percent of the selected power and then pause, varying up and
 down in a pattern that may appear random but with an average value usually
 around 50 percent of the selected power.  During this plateau, the
 controller is determining optimal operating conditions.
 Once this is complete, the brightness will decrease slightly and then
 gradually ramp-up (with minor bumps and dips along the way) toward the
 selected output power.  It may overshoot the selected power momentarily
 by 10 percent or more but will then settle back down and the Ready LED
 should come on.  Fine tuning will go on for another minute or so, but
 after that, the output power which should be stable to within 1 or 2
 percent.  This entire process takes no more than 6 minutes.
<p>
 For the C215M, only the ramp-up portions of this procedure take place
 with no intermediate plateau.  The entire process typically takes no more
 than 2 minutes.
<p>
<li>To change output power, adjust the pot and press Set.  Output power will
 go to zero or near zero and the controller will go through a similar
 but probably somewhat shorter process.  This is similar to the "final
 ramp-up phase" of the initialization algorithm.  <A HREF="c315m1-2.gif">C315M
 DPSS Laser Startup Followed by 25, 60, and 100 Percent Power Settings</A>
 shows the same plot but extended to include three changes in power.
</ul>
<p>
Note that a laser head rated for a specific power (e.g., 100 mW) may actually
produce more or less power based on the setting of P6 on the C215M or C315M
laser head PCB.  (I do not know which pot on the C415M is equivalent.)
The only thing that the Ready light indicates is that the controller has
achieved the power specified by P6, not that the laser is producing rated
power.  So, a low power head may just need to have P6 adjusted if the Ready
light comes on.  Surplus C315M laser heads originally from graphic arts
equipment often come outputting less than rated power, possibly as low as
60 or 70 percent (or even lower).  A few may be running at somewhat over rated
power, which is probably how they were set up at the factory.
<p>
It's possible and rather likely that all C315M-100 laser heads are set to 100
mW or a bit above at the factory and the cause of the reduction (usually) in
the output power is a change in the sensitivity of the monitor photosensor
as a result of slight contamination on the 45 degree plate in the beam
sampler.  It wouldn't take much change in scatter to significantly increase
the photosensor sensitivity without noticeably affecting beam quality
since the photodiode chip is rather large and very close to the plate.
In fact, this might explain why so many C315M laser heads which appear to be
perfectly healthy are showing up surplus: Perhaps when the output power drops
below 80 percent or so of the value specified by the controller, the
recommended preventive maintenance procedure is to replace the laser!  So,
probably, Field Service just isn't allowed to touch the P6 pot. :)  There is
no evidence to support the alternative explanation (which is what I had
originally assumed): That the P6 pots are purposely adjusted with reduced
output power to prolong laser life or for some other reason.  First, this
could always be done via the controller while allowing for more power if
needed.  Second, I've seen no indication on any of the large number of C315M
lasers I've tested that the red sealer on the P6 pot is anything but the
original factory issue, not scraped off and replaced.  And finally, if
this adjustment were done at the factory, the laser would likely be
labeled with its actual output power, not just the standard part number
(Compass 315M-100 or whatever).
<p>
In fact, my experience has been that even if just sitting in a cabinet
in a sealed bag, the P6 calibration will drift over time.  There must
be someting inside the laser head that is outgassing even when the
laser is not being used.  So, just be prepared for the possible need
to tweak the P6 pot from time-to-time.
<p>
Also, the actual output power for a specific sample of a controller driving
the same laser head may vary by a few percent due to tolerances of components
or factory calibration.  A small random change from one power cycle to the
next appears to be normal as well, possibly caused by a combination of random
ripple and noise on the Power Set voltage, and which local maxima is locked
to by the controller.  Both of these are on the order of no more
than a few percent and can always be compensated for by adjusting P6 on the
laser head.
<p>
<b>Powering off:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Power down may be done in any order but I would recommend: Laser Off, Power
 Off, then kill DC power.
<p>
<li>CAUTION: DO NOT MAKE OR CHANGE CONNECTIONS unless DC power is totally
 off - zero volts!  Peculiar behavior or damage to the laser head and/or
 controller may result.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Possible problems:</b>
<p>
Where behavior doesn't match what's described above, use the following guide
to aid in troubleshooting.  This is an abbreviated version of what can be
found in the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsmp">Troubleshooting
Compass M Laser System Problems</A>.
/A>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If the power LED on the control panel or autostart doesn't come on,
 there may be a problem with DC power, the controller, or control panel or
 autostart, or wiring.
<p>
<li>If the power LED is on but the yellow LED on the laser head doesn't come
 on, may be a problem with the controller, the control panel or autostart,
 or wiring.
<p>
<li>If the yellow LED on the laser head is on but there is no beam even
 after a minute, the laser head may be very weak or dead, those pots which
 no one should touch have been touched, or there may be a problem with the
 controller or laser head cable.
<p>
<li>If there is output but the laser never stabilizes and the Ready LED
 never comes on:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Check the cables between the laser head and controller and user
  interface.  A broken wire or popped pin can result in all kinds of
  peculiar behavior.
<p>
 <li>Check to make sure the DC power is adequate - measure the voltage on
  the DC power connector while the laser is initializing.  It should not
  vary by more than +/-5 percent from the nominal value.
  Where this happens on a known good power supply with multiple outputs,
  the most likely cause is insufficient load on the regulated (usually 5
  VDC) output.
<p>
 <li>Where DC power checks out, the laser head may be marginal at the selected
  power setting meaning that it is incapable, at least under some conditions,
  of reaching the selected power.  First, power off for 10 seconds and
  on again and press the Set button on the control panel or autostart adapter.
  If after 6 minutes, the Ready LED still doesn't come on, reduce the power
  setting via the pot on the control panel or autostart adapter to about
  half power (or, if known, approximately the setting that would result
  in at least as much power as it is producing during the search) and try
  again.  If the Ready LED now comes on (after the ramp-up), a weak head
  or improper setting of the P6 pot is the likely cause.  If it still
  doesn't stabilize even at a power level similar or lower than the one
  produced during the search, there is some other cause.
<p>
  If a laser power meter is available, monitor power during initialization.
  Once the controller enters the final ramp-up phase, the power should drop
  back to a low value and then gradually increase to somewhat above the
  selected power before the Ready LED comes on and the power then drops
  back to the selected power and stabilizes.  During the ramp-up, the power
  may fluctuate rather dramatically but the general trend should be
  increasing.  If the power never reaches at least 110 to 115 percent
  of selected power, the laser may not stabilize.
 </ul>
<p>
 Note that if the Ready LED doesn't come on within 10 minutes at most for
 a C315M or C415M (1 to 6 minutes is typical) or 5 minutes at most for
 a C215M (30 seconds to 2 minutes typical), the output will
 <b><i>never</i></b> likely stabilize no matter how long you wait
 since the controller is fruitlessly continuing to attempt its optimization.
 For the C315M, in some cases with a quirky laser head, it may even overshoot
 the selected output power and continue to increase it until reaching the
 diode current limit.  These controllers are sometimes not very smart. :)
<p>
<li>Where the Ready LED comes on but the actual output power as measured using
 a laser power meter is not what is expected, make sure the pot on the control
 panel or autostart adapter is fully clockwise (or where desired) and press
 the Set button to insure that the power setting has be correctly entered.
 If the power is still not correct after the ramp-up, see the section:
 <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclamclp">Adjusting Maximum Compass-M Laser Head
 Power</A>.
<p>
<li>Should the Ready LED go off after having been on for awhile, the most
 likely cause is that at least one of the TECs is not able to maintain the
 proper internal temperature either because the baseplate temperature is too
 high (but not high enough to cause shutdown) or due to a bad TEC or some
 other component or wiring problem.
<p>
<li>Should the laser shut down (yellow LED goes off), the most likely cause
 is inadequate DC current, excessive baseplate (heatsink) temperature, or
 bad connections to the laser head.  The laser can be restarted once the
 fault is corrected.
</ul>
<p>
Most problems with these lasers are attributable to cockpit errors and not
actual failures of either the laser head or controller.  Both units are
quite reliable when powered with a stable DC supply and user interface logic
inputs are sequenced properly.
<p>
When purchasing one of these systems, it is good idea to
include a control panel or autostart adapter even if your intent
is to use a PC interface or other automated scheme to turn the laser
on and off and set power.  Then, you can test the system immediately
when it arrives, and can always go back to a known working configuration
to assure that nothing bad has happened should your fancy high tech
computer control with all the bells and whistles not function correctly.
<p>
Above all, avoid the urge to twiddle any pots on the laser head
without explicit instructions!!!!  And, there are NO user serviceable
parts or adjustments inside either the laser head or controller! :)

<h4><A NAME="sclamclp">Adjusting Maximum Compass-M Laser Head
 Power</A></h4>

Although all C215M, C315M, and C415M laser heads have a power designation
(e.g., -50, -100, -150), the actual maximum power setting is determined by a
pot on the laser head PCB.  For the C215M and C315M, it is P6 (far left
looking from the side).  There is a corresponding pot in the C415M but
I haven't dug deep enough to know which it is.
Surplus laser heads often come outputting significantly less than
the rated power even with the control panel Power Select pot set to full.
A setting of 70 to 85 mW is typical for a C315M-100 originating from a printer.
See the previous section for a likely explanation.  If the laser stabilizes
and the control panel Ready LED comes on (pin 14 of the DB15 user interface
connector - the Ready signal - goes high), then
the laser is achieving the selected power for which it thinks it is set.
Assuming it's not on the hairy edge with a tired and worn down pump diode, the
maximum power setpoint can be adjusted relatively easily and with low risk
of damage.  The pump diode current will be limited by the controller to
a safe value assuming the ILD (P1) pot on the head PCB hasn't been
touched and was set correctly at the factory.  The Ready LED will just
never come on if the controller is unable to achieve the selected power.
However, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!!  I've seen more than one instance
of a failed attempt at adjusting C315M maximum power via the P6 pot which I
had to correct.
<p>
CAUTION: The <b>ONLY</b> pot on the head PCB that should usually be adjusted
is P6, the one for output power.  The others are all set based on the
characteristics of the specific head and should never need to be touched
under most conditions unless someone before you twiddled them all randomly.
Don't even think about touching P1 as that's the diode current limit.
If the pot settings are close to where they should be, the search algorithm
will still be able to find a near optimal set of operating parameters.
However, if far off, the search may zero in on an incorrect local maximum
with no chance of achieving the rated output power, let alone decent
efficiency.  It's possible for there to be 10 mW or less output power at
the diode current limit for a 100 mW laser if just one of the temperature
settings is far off, not a good situation.  If you know the pots have been
twiddled randomly, DON'T power up the laser as damage - possibly terminal -
to the laser head may be the result.  It would be best to set the current
limit to a fairly safe level of 2 A and determine the optimal temperature
settings using a home-built or third party controller.  These can then be
put into the pot settings.  However, you're on your own in this case. :)
<p>
Counterclockwise rotation of the pot increases output power.
<p>
<ul>
<li>If the Coherent cable is used, it will only be possible to change
 the setting with power off since the cable connector shell covers the
 pots.  Be advised that this is a royal pain since it will take around
 5 minutes for each iteration and there could be several due to the
 sensitivity of the P6 adjustment, particularly near full power.
 I don't know if it's possible to cut away or drill a hole in
 the proper place on the shell to expose the P6 pot.
<p>
<li>If you are using some other cable that allows access
 to the pots on the head PCB, then this can be done after the laser has
 gone through its power up sequence and has stabilized.
</ul>
<p>
In either case, it is best to start with the original setting
(or one that is known to reach a stable power) and proceed from there.
After carefully scraping the sealing paint from the pot, mark the original
position with a dab of ink or paint of your own so it can be set back to the
original setting if desired.  Turn the pot by a small amount and then check
output power.
<p>
<ul>
<li>If this is done with the laser on and it's a small increase or decrease,
 the power will change almost immediately usually with the Ready LED remaining
 on.  The change is done by adjusting the KTP and RES temperatures only.
 If the difference between actual and selected power is large enough that
 the Ready LED goes off just adjusting the KTP and RES temperatures may not
 be enough and after awhile, the diode current will be increased by 1 D/A step
 of the driver (about 18 mA for a didoe with a current limit of 2.5 A)
 and it will try adjusting the KTP and RES
 temperatures again.  This procedure will be repeated until
 the selected output power is achieved or the diode current limit is reached.
<p>
 So, if the Ready LED never comes on, the new power setting is likely beyond
 the capabilities of the specific laser head <i>using the existing head
 PCB pot settings</i>.  Reduce the setting and allow
 time for the laser to stabilize.  However, it may be necessary to power down
 to fully reinitialize.  Note that even if the laser is capable of more than
 the selected power, it may never stabilize because the controller likes to
 see some headroom above the selected power to provide adjustment flexibility.
 And if the adjustment is turned too far <i>down</i>, a runaway condition
 may result since apparently at least some revisions of the controller can
 only <i>increase</i> diode current if the temperature adjustments fail to
 achieve rated power.  Also see the section:
 <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315a">Analog Controller for the C315M</A>.
<p>
<li>If using the Coherent cable, it will be necessary to power down completely
 (DC off), remove the cable, adjust the pot, replace the cable, power up, and
 wait for the laser to stabilize.  It's a pain.  If the Ready LED never comes
 on, the new power setting is likely beyond the capabilities of the specific
 laser head.  Power down, reduce it, and try again.
</ul>
<p>
The adjustment is fairly sensitive at the high end so don't go too
far too fast.  Very roughly, 1/10th rotation will probably change the setting
by about 20 percent near 100 mW.  If the Ready LED never comes on, then the
laser is incapable of reaching the specified power.  Note that turning the
pot fully counterclockwise is probably not a useful approach to achieve
maximum power since if the controller is unable to achieve the selected
power, what the laser does produce won't be stable, though depending on the
particular unit, this may indicate how high it can go.  But it's quite
possible that even the peaks of the fluctuating power may be <i>below</i> the
rated power because the higher diode current results in the temperature
of the diode not being optimal.  If your control panel has a variable power
setting, determining how low it has to go for the laser to be happy will
provide an indication of how far off the head setting is.  Further note that
some headroom may be needed for the controller algorithm to be happy -
possibly as much as 10 percent or more above the selected power in some
cases.  More on this below.
<p>
While the search algorithm is in progress, the typical laser output power
after the initial ramp-up seems to vary around 40 to 60 percent of the selected
power.  In other words, if the selected power is 100 mW, the power during
warmup will fluctuate between 40 and 60 mW so this can be used as a rough guide
if you'd rather not wait until the Ready LED comes on.  After the search is
complete, the local area of the KTP and resonator (RES) temperatures are
locked in at which point the pump diode current drops to a lower value (about
80 or 90 percent of the search current) and then slowly increases (with pauses
along the way for fine KTP and RES temperature adjustment) until the output
power is equal to the setpoint (within a small window).  One might assume that
power is regulated by the controller adjusting pump diode current but
this appears not to be the case as small changes in P6 change the output
power a corresponding amount but the diode current remains absolutely
constant.  In fact, KTP and RES temperature adjustment is used to maintain
output power constant.  If for some reason, these don't succeed (as if
P6 is turned too far while the laser is operating), only then is LD
current increased.  But LD current apparently will never be decreased,
and this can result in runaway behavior without ever stabilizing under some
conditions.  The LD current limit shouldn't be exceeded though.
<p>
It appears as though if the diode current limit is reached during the
final ramp-up, the laser may never come ready even if the output power
exceeds the power setpoint later on.  My guess is that the firmware algorithm
attempts to maintain some headroom and is too stupid to realize that it has
enough under some conditions.  For example, I was testing a C315M laser head
that could do 107 mW at the diode current limit but would not stabilize unless
the power was set to less than 100 mW.  Also note that a few C315M laser heads
may not stabilize at lower power due to abrupt jumps in output power with
increasing LD current, similarly confusing the controller.  These may also
require adjustment of the P2 pot - or may simply refuse to cooperate
entirely!  High mileage lasers with "spiking bahavior" may be more prone
to this malady.  Sometimes, just pressing the Set button again to initiate
a new final ramp-up will allow it to settle some percentage of the time.
<p>
CAUTION: While it may be possible to increase power to 150 percent or more
of the laser's ratings (I've seen over 150 mW from a C315M-100!), life
expectancy may be substantially reduced when running continuously at these
high levels.  The position of the pot relative to its maximum counterclockwise
rotation stop is not an indication of how much additional power is possible or
a good idea.  (In addition, it may be necessary to adjust the TL (P2) pot in
this case.)  My recommendation would be to set the laser head adjustment
for the lowest power your application can tolerate.  Then, you won't be
as tempted to turbopower it unnecessarily! :)
<p>
In very rare instances, the controller may not stabilize even at a
power setting for which there is plenty of reserve on the pump diode.
Rather, it will produce an oscillation or ringing in the output power
with a period of up to a few seconds.  Where this has happened,
changing the power setting was usually sufficient calm it down.  The
cause is unknown but may have to do with there being a mode hop at a
"bad" place in the KTP temperature response function.  The likelihood
of this problem seems to be much greater at high power with one case
showing up only above 130 mW on a C315M-150.  Unless the P4 or P5 pots
on the laser head were turned, this behavior is likely due to a
problem inside the laser head.  Hopefully you'll never see it.
<p>
As noted, the P2 pot (second from the right) may need to be adjusted
when significantly increasing output power beyond the rated value.  In some
cases, it will have to be turned clockwise slightly to decrease the sensed
temperature for best performance, or to achieve stability at all.
What happens is that as the LD current goes up as will be needed
for higher power, since the temperature sensor is located somewhat away
from the LD chip, the difference between the actual and sensed temperature
increases and therefore the controller needs to maintain a colder
temperature for the actual LD junction temperature to be the same.  The
controller may decrease LD temperature somewhat with increasing LD current
(by adding a voltage proportional to LD current to the output of the P2 pot)
but this is only partially effective.  I don't recommend bothering with this
unless a problem is noted, specifically that in the final ramp-up phase of
the controller algorithm, the output power starts trending downward as the LD
current increases.  If the output power increases more or less continuously
with LD current (there will usually be bumps and dips along the way), don't
worry about it.  Otherwise, mark the initial position,
rotate P2 about 1/20th turn clockwise, and then press the Power Set button
to initiate a new final ramp-up.  This should reduce the power dip.  If it
goes away, be happy. :)  If there is still a dip but it is reduced, another
small change may be needed.
<p>
It's also possible to fine tune the output power in semi-real-time.  Connect
an op-amp unity-gain buffer with an offset adjust to the wiper of the
Power Set pot.  Put its output through a scaling resistor of about 100K
ohms to "Output Mon" (pin 24) of the laser head.  This should provide
and adjustment range of +/-5 percent or so.  With care, an op-amp that
runs on +5 VDC can be powered directly from the laser head.
<p>
To use it, set the offset
to 0 (so the output of the op-amp is the same as the Power Set pot)
and power up the system.  Once it stabilizes - which should be at the
original output power - adjusting the offest control up or down should
result in a corresponding change in output power within a few seconds.
If it the power is offset too high though, the controller will have to
increase the diode current, which will take longer, and it will be stuck
with the new higher current because it can't be reduced without a new
power set cycle on any controller I've tested.  Use only at your own risk and
your mileage may vary. :)

<h4><A NAME="sclcmwlt">Wavelength Tuning of Compass-M Lasers</A></h4>

While there is no direct way to adjust the wavelength of the C215M or C315M
lasers using the Coherent Controllers, it should be possible to fake them
into doing this indirectly.  (C415M lasers are not supposed to be single
frequency, so none of this applies.)  While initializing, the Coherent Analog
Controller varies the RES and KTP temperature to locate the best operating
point.  The net effect of this is to move the lasing line across the gain
curve of the Nd:YAG.  Once the laser stabilizes, the lasing line can be
anywhere near the center of the gain curve, though the controller may
have rules about how far from the center it can be before increasing
diode current to have the best chance of maintaining single frequency
operation.
<p>
Shining the beam through an iodine absorption cell looks really cool
as the C315M goes through its paces.  The path of the beam flashes on
and off and lights up like a gas discharge sign at times.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioiivcr">The Iodine
Vapor Cell Wavelength Reference</A>.)
Each dip in <A HREF="i532a1.gif">Iodine Absorption Spectrum
Near 532 nm</A> means the iodine vapor is absorbing
some of the incident light and the gas will actually fluoresce
a green or green-yellow color, which is actually a combination of many
wavelengths including some red ones.  The lower the dip, the brighter it
will glow and also reduce the light coming out the other end.  I'm not
quite sure where the exact center of the Nd:YVO4 gain curve would fall on this
plot.  Corrections and additions welcome.  Since the laser wavelength
after stabilization cannot be specified, the chance of it staying on
one of the strong iodine absorption lines by accident is relatively low.
So, if it is desired to use this type of setup as a grossly overpriced
glowing high tech sculpture, some other approach must be considered. :)
<p>
To slightly adjust the wavelength of any laser, what's needed is to be able
to control the cavity length.  The maximum continuous tuning range will be
the FSR (Free Spectral Range) of the cavity.  (FSR is c/2L where c is the
speed of light and L is the effective optical length of the cavity.)
The cavity of the C215M or C315M is built on a ceramic plate with the
HR and OC mirrors forming the ends of the resonator (RES), but the
temperature of the KTP and Nd:YAG crystals also effects the optical
length due to their change in length and index of refraction.  For Nd:YAG,
the gain bandwidth is order of 150 GHz, but the FSR of the C215M and C315M
cavity is only about 3 GHz, though it's not known how much of this range
the controller actually uses.  Thus, the actual tuning range will be less
than 3 GHz, but this may be sufficient for many applications.  Of course,
it will only be slow tuning since the only control available is via
temperature.
<p>
The easiest approach is then to take control of RES temperature
and allow the Analog Controller (either C215M or C315M) to deal
with KTP temperature.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>C315M laser head with C315M Analog Controller:</b> Disconnect the
 RES TEC stack from the Analog Controller and drive it from an external
 temperature controller.
<p>
<li><b>C315M laser head with C215M Analog Controller:</b> Drive the RES
 TEC using an external temperature controller.
<p>
<li><b>C215M laser head with C215M or C315M Analog Controller:</b> Put the
 laser head on a big TEC and heatsink and use an external temperature
 controller to drive it.  (The C215M laser head has no internal RES TEC.)
</ul>
<p>
Then, slightly changing the temperature of the RES TEC or baseplate will
vary the laser cavity length.  The Analog Controller will then adjust KTP
temperature to maintain the selected output power.  The net effect will be
to change the effective cavity length, though it's not clear if there will
be an obvious relationship of temperature to wavelength since (1) there will
be interaction between the RES and KTP temperatures and (2) at any given
stable point, there is no way to know which side of the gain curve it's
on and thus which direction the wavelength will move.
<p>
Another option would be to add an offset into the sensed output power via
the P6 pot, which would again indirectly move the wavelength on the gain
cuver to compensate.  But there would also be a slight change in output
power with this approach.
<p>
And, of course, this should be very easy if using the C215M or C315M
laser head on a laboratory controller.

<h3><A NAME="sclc215">Coherent Compass 215M Green DPSS Laser</A></h3>

The following sections deal specifically with the C215M laser head.  Most
operational information will be the same as for the C315M so mainly the
differences are highlighted here.  Where there is no specific section on
the C215M, refer to the corresponding section for the C315M.
<p>
Unless you have a C215M laser head and/or controller, there is probably
no need to read these sections, except out of curiosity.  Even if you do,
it's probably better to read about the C315M first as the descriptions
for it are much more detailed.  So, skip directly to
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315">Coherent Compass 315M Green DPSS Laser</A>.

<h4><A NAME="sclc215d">C215M Laser Head Description</A></h4>

The C215M laser head is similar in size to the C315M but its case is made
of the same higher quality (in appearance at least) material as the C415M with
a similar recessed soldered lid.  It had a milled chrome or gold plated finish
rather than gold plated sheet metal.  And, corners are rounded. :)
However, the head PCB is the same as one of the versions for the C315M
and on the outside just as with the C315M but some component values may
differ and a few parts are missing.
<p>
The optical design of the C215M laser head is virtually the same as
for the C315M but there is no TEC at all for the resonator and the connections
for the upper LD TEC are also not present.  This was determined
both by the observation that the P3 pot (RES temperature setpoint) was missing
from the head PCB (but the pads for it are there) and the RES TEC and Upper
LD TEC pins read as an open circuit.  (On some samples, the P3 pot and
its associated components are present but presumably serve no function
on C215M lasers.)  The connector pins for the RES and
LD thermistors are also shorted together internally which means there is
no separate RES thermistor.  Therefore, the conclusion is that the
LD and RES mounting plates are one in the same.  The lack of an upper LD TEC
wouldn't appear to matter much as it's likely both TECs would only be
needed under worst case conditions of high diode current and high
heatsink temperature.  Since the C215M runs at lower power, this situation
wouldn't be present.
<p>
Despite the lack of a RES TEC and upper LD TEC, it seems as though the C215M
can be powered by the Coherent Analog Controller for the C315M though
it is not known if the efficiency and stability of laser output power
will be as good as with the proper controller.  With the lack of a RES
TEC, one of the required optimization parameters is lacking.  However,
it's very likely that the optical platform is actually thermally tied
to the laser diode since it almost certainly does need to be temperature
stabilized.  What the implications of having the same LD thermistor for both
the LD and RES temperature control loops means is not known.  I also don't
know whether anything else has also been changed, or if they just accept
the consequences for this lower power laser.
<p>
The pump diode in the C215M-75 laser head I tested
has a threshold and maximum current (Imax) to that of some C315M
pump diodes, with a relatively low Imax of about 1.92 A.  At an output
power of 75 mW, diode current is about 1.42 A representing a very good
percent current limit rating of 74 percent.  Before I realized this was a
C215M rather than just a way-cool looking C315M (the label was originally
hidden by the mounting), I cranked up the P6 pot with output power peaking
at over 120 mW at the current limit.  Therefore, it should run fine
as a C315M-100.

<h4><A NAME="sclc215a">Analog Controller for the C215M</A></h4>

The C215M laser head attaches to the Coherent "Analog Controller", a small
light-weight box which provides the power to the laser diode and the two
TECs.  It uses the settings of the pots on the side-mounted PCB on the
laser head as starting points to determine a set of optimal values for
the temperature of the laser diode and KTP.  Operation is similar
to that of the controller for the C315M, but is simpler and faster, with
the entire initialization taking under 2 minutes.
<p>
When power is applied and thermal control is enabled, the controller adjusts
the temperatures of the laser diode/optics platform and KTP to preset values
from the pot settings on the PCB of the laser head.  Enabling the laser diode
or changing output power initiates an algorithmic procedure to determine an
optimal set of operating parameters, a process that typically takes 1 to 2
minutes.  During this time, the output power will be generally increasing but
with wild fluctuations - this is normal - and then finally stabilize at
the specified output power.  The temperatures and LD current are
continuously monitored.  Excessive temperature or excessive LD current
will set status bits and shut down the laser.
<p>
The initialization algorithm is significantly simpler for the C215M
controller compared to the C315M.  All it does is to ramp up the laser
diode current in small steps a second or so apart, while presumably
adjusting the KTP temperature for maximum power output until it
exceeds the setpoint power by some amount (maybe 10 percent).  Then it
likely uses KTP temperature for fine adjustment.  With one fewer
degrees of freedom than the C315M (no RES TEC), this process is much
simpler and quicker.  The laser diode and optics platform are probably
both on what is the LD TEC in the C315M, so their temperatures are
nearly the same and either constant, or slightly dependent on the
laser diode current.  Like the C315M controller, laser diode current
cannot be decreased should the output power go above the window where
KTP temperature is sufficient to bring it down to the selected output
power.  (For a C215M laser head, the only way this could happen without
an actual failure of some component would be if the temperature didn't
stabilize before the selected output power was reached and Ready came on.)
However, unlike the C315M controller, the C215M controller doesn't get confused
and <i>increase</i> laser diode current in this case.
<p>
Also, once the laser becomes Ready, it may not both to try to maintain the
output power constant as long as any drift is relatively slow and within the
Ready window.  I don't know how large this window is but it is probably at
least 10 percent but it may not be symmetric with respect to the original
power setpoint.
<p>
However, like the C315M, there appears to be a significant difference in the
output power the system produces after stabilizing from one power cycle to
the next, even worse for the C215M.  These is a fair amount of noise and
ripple on the +5 VDC line from the controller to the control panel so it
might be better to use a regulated external 5 VDC power supply or boost and
regulate down the +5 VDC from the controller for the power set pot instead.
But I don't think that is the entire cause.  The controller may simply not
be that fussy about the exact output power when the initialization algorithm
finds a suitable stable point to lock to in the power output response
function.  With fewer degrees of freedom, the options may be more
limited.  Maybe. :)
<p>
A DB15M connector attaches to the basic user
control panel which allows the laser operation and power level to be set
via some switches and a pot. The actual power output and status may also
be monitored.  It's quite trivial to construct a rudimentary control panel.
This interface is essentially the same as the one for
the C315M and C415M controllers.  However, there is an additional 2 pin
jumper on the controller labeled: "Autostart Jumper" or "Interlock Jumper".
With this installed, the laser will start up automatically upon power-on
even without anything attached to the DB15.  There is also a high density
connector similar to the one for the Digital Controller (but not quite
identical and not compatible!) with the C315M.  However, it doesn't appear
to be supported for user control (there's no documentation and it's normally
covered with the "Warranty Void if Removed" sticker so probably only used
for factory testing.
<p>
DC input to the Analog Controller for the C215M must be 5 VDC (linear
or switchmode power supply).  The maximum current shown on a label is 10 A but
there is a 7 A fuse inside.  I assumed it would be a less complex version of
the controller for the C315M (with reduced current requirements and fewer TECs)
which is a set of switchmode converters, but be otherwise similar.  However,
unlike the controller for the C315M which is dripping with massive toroidal
inductors wound with fat wire, there is nothing similar in this unit.
The driver for the laser diode TEC appears to be pulse width modulated
since the power dissipation is minimal.  I has a full H-bridge providing
bipolar drive, probably feeding an RC filter to the TEC since there is
no evidence of a high frequency chopped signal.  It does a sort of bang-bang
control initially but eventually settles down to a nearly constant drive
voltage.  I do not know what's present for the LD current or KTP TEC drive,
though the latter is probably just a power op-amp.  However, like the
controller for the C315M, there are two GAL16V8D PLDs.  One is associated
with the DB15 User Interface connector control, status, and error signals.
The other probably implements the initialization and power regulation
algorithms.
<p>
Compared to the Analog Controller for the C315M, the one for the C215M is
quite simple with a dense but not ridiculously dense circuit board and
few piggybacked components.  Everything is accessible so in principle,
repair would be possible, but of course, no service information is available.
<p>
Given the similarity of the C215M and C315M lasers, it would be desirable
to be able to use the C215M controller to drive a C315M laser head.
Since the C215M controller lacks specific capabilities needed to drive
the C315M laser head, some additional external circuitry will probably be
required to run a C315M laser head continuously, even at low power.
However, it's possible to power up a C315M on a C215M controller just
to see if the laser will come on and produce some green light.  But, leaving
it on for more than a minute or so is not recommended.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315c2">Powering the C315M
with the C215M Analog Controller</A>.  

<h3><A NAME="sclc315">Coherent Compass 315M Green DPSS Laser</A></h3>

The following sections deal specifically with the C315M laser head internal
wiring and circuitry, and powering it without the Coherent analog controller.
<p>
For the most part, the operation information below also applies to the C215M
with the understanding that there is no RES TEC or separate RES temperature
sensor thermistor (the pin for it is tied to the LD thermistor).  There is
also no upper LD TEC in the C215M.  I don't know if the internal layout is
the same but assume that it is.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315h">C315M Laser Head Optical Layout</A></h4>

The general organization of the C315M is a Fabry-Perot (linear) cavity
just over 1-3/4 inches (about 45 mm) in length.  It uses a small Nd:YAG rod
(4 mm in diameter, 6 mm long, not vanadate) with a separate HR mirror.
Photos can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.94 or
higher) under "Coherent Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers".
<p>
The following are brief descriptions of each of the labeled parts in the
last photo which is also included here as
<A HREF="c315cav1.jpg">C315M Cavity Components and Output Optics</A>.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pump Diode with GRIN Lens:</b>  Older C315M laser heads have a
 bare laser diode chip on a metal block (non-standard) soldered to the back
 of the metal case.  Newer ones use a C-block laser diode screwed down to
 the back of the metal case.  The GRIN lens is soldered or glued
 into the output aperture.  This is the only beam shaping optic.  There
 is nothing else inside.  After writing this originally, I kept thinking
 that I might have missed a fiber microlens
 collimate the fast axis of the diode.  But reinspection confirms that there
 is none.  See <A HREF="c315mld1.jpg">Interior of Coherent C315M-100 Pump
 Diode Showing Non-Standard Mount</A>.
 Without fast-axis correction, it would be difficult to achieve
 the relatively low divergence needed inside the YAG rod and a significant
 percentage of the pump power would be wasted.  Perhaps this is why
 the efficiency of these lasers is generally lower than many other lasers
 of similar output power.  A 100 ohm resistor is soldered across the external
 pins to provide some ESD protection.  The maximum current for the
 diode typically between 2.2 and 2.6 A.
<p>
 What appear to be the threshold, operating, and maximum current for the laser
 diode when new are scribed on the top of the laser diode case.  (The order of
 these values may not be the same in all instances.)  For example, a typical
 set of numbers might be: 0.70 1.75 2.43.  I assume these are in amps for the
 specific laser head at its optimal temperature settings.  In the example,
 0.70 would be the lowest current for any green output; 1.75 would be the
 current at the head's rated output power, and 2.43 would be the maximum safe
 current for the diode (and probably the current limit setting on the head
 PCB).  However, I have seen at least one case where the Coherent Analog
 Controller increased the current higher than the engraved value so I'm not
 sure how much attention is paid to it.  But I didn't let it increase it much
 beyond the value so it might have just been my measurement error.
<p>
<li><b>Green Filter:</b> This is a thin piece of red material which absorbs
 any green light returning to the pump diode.  (Not present in the photo
 since it was mounted on the internal cavity cover which has been removed.)
<p>
<li><b>HR Mirror:</b> Concave high reflector cavity mirror.
<p>
<li><b>Nd:YAG Assembly:</b> The tiny YAG rod is mounted in a metal
 heatsink.  The actual crystal is about 4 mm in diameter by 6 mm in length.
<p>
<li><b>Stop 1:</b> Intracavity aperture plate. (Not present in the photo
 since it was mounted on the internal cavity cover (the "roof") which has
 been removed.)
<p>
<li><b>Brewster Plate Assembly:</b> A 45 degree angled plate is mounted
 on a metal bracket.  This is needed to force linear polarization of the
 intracavity beam since YAG is non-polarized.
<p>
<li><b>KTP on TEC:</b> A 2x2x5mm (WxHxL) KTP crystal is attached to a TEC.
<p>
<li><b>OC Mirror:</b> This is the output coupler mirror for the laser cavity.
<p>
<li><b>Stop 2:</b> Aperture just following the OC Mirror.  This cuts
 stray light exiting the laser cavity but doesn't appear to be absolutely
 necessary.  I have a sample of a C315M where Stop 2 fell off with no
 noticeable change in performance or beam quality.
<p>
<li><b>Turning Mirror 1:</b> This right angle prism is coated to reflect
 green (532 nm) and pass IR.  I assume that the only reason it's a prism
 shape and not a simple mirror is lack of reflections from the second
 surface or convenience in mounting.
<p>
<li><b>Beam Sampler:</b> A thin optical plate that reflects a portion of the
 output beam down to a photosensor.  A filter (the green thing) blocks
 IR from reaching the sensor.  CAUTION: Photodiode connected to ceramic
 substrate circuit traces via fine bonding wires, easily broken.
<p>
 Note that contamination on this surface may result in a change in the
 photodiode sensitivity since it is in close proximity to it, possibly
 long before there is a noticeable effect on the beam.  It's possible
 that even in the sealed enclosure, there can be enough change over time
 to result in a power drop off because the scatter <i>increases</i>
 photodiode sensitivity.  Maybe that's why the photodiode for power
 monitoring in the C415M is separated by a significant distance from
 the angled plate.
<p>
<li><b>Turning Mirror 2:</b> Same as Turning Mirror 1.
<p>
<li><b>Output Lens:</b> Optic to control the divergence and diameter of
 the output beam.
<p>
<li><b>Output Stop:</b> Aperture to control output beam shape and/or suppress
 ghost beams.  Some units may have another stop before the Output Lens and/or
 the Output Stop may be in a different location and/or with an additional
 metal strip added and/or cutaway as a sort of afterthought. :)
<p>
<li><b>Output Window:</b> AR coated plate that seals laser head case.  Note
 that the gold plated ring in which the window is mounted is soldered to the
 metal case.  On some units, a lonely blob of solder will be visible inside
 next to the ring.  As long as it doesn't interfere with the beam, ignore it!
</ul>
<p>
By careful temperature tuning of the KTP and cavity length, it should be
possible to select single longitudinal mode/single frequency operation of
this cavity design using the polarization preference of the Brewster plate
and birefringence of the KTP crystal to implement a birefringent filter,
and the KTP surfaces as an etalon.
See the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315f">Birefringence or Etalon
Effect Used for Mode Selection in C315M?</A>.
This would select out a single mode within the YAG gain curve.  Since there
is separate control of KTP temperature and overall cavity length (via
temperature control), there are enough degrees of freedom.
<p>
The "roof" and stops don't appear to affect beam quality in any major way.
However, they do suppress ghost beams inside the laser.  One purpose
may be to minimize stray 808 nm and 1,064 nm "light" from hitting the
power monitor photodiode.  Without the roof, Stop 1, and Stop 2, the
photodiode sees about 50 percent more power with the lid in place than
without it.  I don't know how much of this is 808 mm or 1,064 nm rather
than the desired 532 nm.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315a">Analog Controller for the C315M</A></h4>

The C315M laser head attaches to the Coherent "Analog Controller", a small
very densely populated light-weight box which provides the power to the
laser diode and several TECs.  Photos can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.86 or
higher) under "Coherent Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers".
It uses the settings of the pots on the
side-mounted PCB on the laser head as starting points to determine a set
of optimal values for the temperature of the laser diode, resonator, and
KTP.  During the initialization process (which typically takes 1 to 6 minutes
according the the Coherent C315M manual), the controller systematically varies
these temperatures about the pot settings to maximize output power.  Once the
best values have been determined, these are held constant and the laser diode
current is used to control output power.  This should result in the most
efficient operation using the lowest laser diode current.  Supposedly. :)
(See the previous two sections for more info.)
<p>
Input to the Analog Controller is a power source from 12 to 28 VDC (linear
or switchmode power supply), and a DB15M connector for the basic user control
panel which allows the laser operation and power level to be set via some
switches and a pot.  The actual power output and status may also be monitored.
It's quite trivial to construct a rudimentary control panel but do heed the
warning below.
<p>
The so-called "Digital Controller" attaches to the Analog Controller via an
interface connector and allows a PC or other digital system to set the laser
power and monitor laser operation remotely.  It does NOT replace the Analog
Controller.  This box is much less commonly available than the Analog
Controller since it really isn't needed for most applications.  And, with
a basic D/A and some simple logic, most of its functions can be replicated
via the user interface of the Analog Controller.
<p>
The rest of this section are details on the internals of the analog controller.
To just use it with your laser, see the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsmx">Using the Coherent Analog Controller</A>.
<p>
Some of the following is from the Coherent C315M Operator's Manual and the
rest from educated guesswork, functional tests, and internal exploration.
<p>
When power is applied and thermal control is enabled, the controller adjusts
the temperatures of the laser diode, resonator, and KTP to preset values from
the pot settings on the PCB of the laser head.  Enabling the laser diode or
changing output power initiates an algorithmic procedure to determine an
optimal set of operating parameters, a process that typically takes 1 to 6
minutes.  During this time, the output power will fluctuate significantly -
this is normal - and then finally stabilize at the specified output power.  The
temperatures and LD current are continuously monitored.  Excessive temperature
or excessive LD current will set status bits and shut down the laser.
<p>
For the description below, "Power On/Off" is the same as the "T" switch;
"Laser On/Off" is the same as the "L" switch; and "Power Set" is the same
as the "E" switch.  These are described as switches but can also be TTL
logic levels.
<p>
In more detail, it appears as though the Analog Controller operates in the
following manner.  This is based on measurements of the LD current and LD,
KTP, and RES temperature error voltages.  For initial power-on, all steps
are taken.  Only those starting with the "final ramp-up" phase will be
performed for a change in power after Ready comes on, at which point simply
changing Laser On/Off to the "Off" state and then back to "On" may result in
the laser coming up to the previous power almost immediately.  At least I saw
this once or twice.  More generally, it seems to go through the something
similar to the final ramp-up phase.
<p>
<ol>
<li>When Power On/Off is turned on, thermal control is enabled.  Starting
 temperatures for LD, KTP, and RES are loaded from the head PCB
 pot settings.  The respective TECs are driven toward these setpoint
 temperatures.
<p>
<li>When Laser On/Off is turned on, after a 5 to 10 second delay, LD current
 is ramped up until green output power exceeds about 50 percent of that
 selected by the P6 pot on the laser head.  However, the initial diode
 current may depend on *how* the controller is started:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the Power Set button is pressed prior to or during initial ramp-up, the
  controller will always reset to the lowest diode current and ramp-up slowly
  from there.  The Coherent manual states that the Power Set button should be
  pressed whenever power is applied even though the power level is stored
  in non-volatile memory.  So, exactly what is the
  point of storing the previous power setting if the controller is
  incapable of using it!  Sounds like some engineer should be fired.
  Or, perhaps, these are just undocumented features. :)
<p>
  However, although the behavior
  differs as described below, there doesn't appear to be any risk to the laser
  and the end result is essentially the same if this is not done.  Of course,
  Power Set should be pressed if the combination of laser head and controller
  is changed.  The Coherent Autostart and Version 1.2 of my Autostart
  automatically pulse Power Set when power is turned on.
<p>
 <li>If the Power Set button is NOT pressed, the controller may start at a
  current equal to or slightly below that of the search value for 50 percent
  output power from the previous power cycle, or may jump immediately to
  approximately the operating current from the previous power cycle and
  possibly even increase the current somewhat if the output power at this
  point doesn't immediately exceed 50 percent of the desired power.  Whether
  the latter takes place seems to depend on a combination of the controller
  revision and for further unexplained reasons, on the DC power supply voltage.
  This seems to happen reasonably consistently if using a 24 VDC power supply
  rather than a 12 or 15 VDC power supply, and sequencing Power On/Off
  and Laser On/Off very quickly immediately after application of DC power
  either manually or via an autostart adapter.  Why the input voltage should
  matter at all is a real mystery but probably has to do with how long it takes
  for internal controller voltages to stabilize.  The Coherent manuals states
  that Power Set should be pulsed whenever DC power is applied so I guess
  they know something doesn't reliably reset properly. :)
<p>
  Note that even if laser heads having widely different maximum diode currents
  are swapped between power cycles, no damage can occur from excessive current
  because it is really the stored laser diode <i>control voltage</i> that is
  used, not the actual diode current, which is scaled by the P1 pot setting
  of the laser head to be below the diode current limit even if the control
  voltage is at its maximum possible value.
 </ul>
<p>
 In all cases, it does still go through at least an abbreviated
 search as described below and the resulting operating point generally
 ends up being virtually the same.
<p>
 None of these variations in behavior are documented in the Coherent
 manual, only that the laser will restart at the previous output power level
 if power cycled without explicitly changing it.  But they do say to
 pulse Power Set any time the DC power is cycled.  Sounds like the controller
 designers neglected to include a full power-on reset circuit!
<p>
 Once at least 50 percent output power is achieved, the current usually
 remains constant for the duration of the search phase, but if power drops
 too much, the controller may decide to increment it again during or prior
 to the search phase.
<p>
 If the controller is unable to achieve 50 percent output power at less than
 the LD current limit during initial ramp-up, it may never shut down but just
 get stuck in an infinite loop with the diode driven at maximum (but safe
 for the laser diode) current.
<p>
<li>LD temperature is given time to stabilize at the setpoint value.  It is
 only changed after this in an effort to track LD current.  I don't believe
 LD current is involved in the search  algorithm.  Unlike KTP and RES, LD
 temperature uses the setpoint directly and is not optimized based
 on output power.  Rather, it has been determined at the factory to be
 optimal <i>at full rated power</i>.  However, the LD temperature setpoint may
 be modified somewhat by the controller as a function of laser diode current
 (by adding in an offset voltage) to lower the sensed temperature for higher
 current and hopefully maintain the actual LD junction temperature - and thus
 the pump wavelength - relatively constant.  But the TL pot (P2) on the
 laser head still controls the LD temperature in real time and is not simply
 an initial value.  And, adjusting it if running at other than rated power
 may result in higher efficiency at that power level.  (However, although TL
 adjustment could be done using the Coherent Analog Controller, there is
 usually no way to know with it whether an improvement has been made without
 going through the final ramp-up.  So, optimization with a home-built or third
 party controller would be best.  The exception is that at the diode current
 limit, an adjustment of the TL pot will result in a change in average output
 power, though the controller will still be modifying KTP and RES temperatuers
 so the power will fluctuate.  But, the diode current limit is not usually
 where you want your laser to be operating!)
<p>
<li>In the "search phase", KTP temperature is rapidly swept up and down while
 RES temperature is slowly varied starting from one end of its possible range
 to the other, all the while remembering the best settings for both KTP and RES
 temperature within this "2-D" search pattern.  After awhile, the KTP
 search settles down to a very small range while the RES temperature goes
 through a few cycles decreasing in amplitude until it too settles down.
 I assume that the extent of both the KTP and RES sweeps have been selected
 to cover the likely location of the global maximum centered around the head
 PCB temperature settings.  On C315M laser heads for which the PCB settings
 and sensor readings were compared during warmup, the optimal location
 turned out to be very close to the head PCB pot settings.
<p>
 All this results in the "fluffing and pulsing" behavior visible in the
 green output beam during the warmup or power setting process.
<p>
<li>In the "final ramp-up phase", LD current is first reduced to between 85 and
 90 percent of the search phase value, and then slowly increased in increments
 of about 35 mA (the specific increment will vary depending on the particular
 laser head but appears to be 2 steps of the D/A that drives the laser diode
 control voltage), momentarily pausing while KTP and RES temperatures are fine
 tuned to maximize output power while maintaining the same peak on the KTP/RES
 response curve.  As the final value is approached, there may one or more
 final current increments of 1 D/A step even after the Ready LED comes
 on, possibly to provide headroom to allow for more flexibility in maintaining
 the output power constant with only KTP and RES temperature adjustment.
<p>
 Output power should go up more or less continuously during final ramp-up,
 but possibly with wild variations along the way as the KTP and RES
 temperatures are adjusted, but the overall trend should be increasing.
 Where there is an extended dip or period of decreasing power even with
 increasing diode current, LD temperature may be set too high for the
 selected final power.  However, this is only likely to happen if the
 output power is being set way above the original rated power or if
 someone has randomly turned the head PCB pots.
<p>
 The actual output power once settled may change slighlty from one power
 cycle to the next.  I don't know if this is simply error in sampling the
 power set pot or something else.  These is a fair amount of noise and
 ripple on the +5 VDC line from the controller to the control panel so it
 might be better to use a regulated external 5 VDC power supply or boost and
 regulate down the +5 VDC from the controller for the power set pot instead.
 But I don't think that is the entire cause.  The controller may simply not
 be that fussy about the exact output power when the initialization algorithm
 finds a suitable stable point to lock to in the power output response
 function.
<p>
<li>Once the output power is within a specified error window of the head PCB
 P6 pot setting, Ready is turned on and output power is maintained by
 adjusting KTP and RES temperatures.  It would appear that RES temperature
 is the primary loop (which tends to return to a fixed value) while KTP
 temperature is the secondary loop (settles down with an offset) but the
 evidence for this is somewhat sketchy as the range of values for the error
 voltage (reference voltage minus sensor voltage) is very very small.  During
 the transient, the error voltages may vary by 0.01 to 0.1 mV or more.  But
 after the error voltages settle down, the entire range over which they
 eventually stabilize may only be 0.004 mV!  So, it might be the other
 way around.
<p>
 Only if the output power cannot be maintained using KTP and RES temperature
 control alone, is the LD current then increased in increments of 1 D/A step,
 again pausing after each step to adjust KTP and RES temperature, in
 an attempt to achieve the selected power.  This is similar to the end of
 the final ramp-up phase in behavior.  I have never seen pump current
 <i>decrease</i>, which could mean there is a fundamental flaw in the
 algorithm.  If small adjustments of the temperatures aren't able to bring
 the power back down to within the error window, the controller may get
 confused and think more current is needed.  The result in a runaway condition
 where LD current will continue to be increased until the current limit
 is reached.  It shouldn't damage the laser but never results in a stable
 output.  Depending on the firmware revision, the controller may then
 continue to jiggle the KTP and RES temperatures in an infinite loop, or
 simply go dormant with all parameters constant.  It might make sense for
 it to shut down but I've yet to see one do this.
<p>
 Also, if the diode current limit is reached during the final ramp-up phase,
 the laser may never come ready even if the output power exceeds the power
 setpoint later.  My guess is that the firmware algorithm attempts to
 maintain some headroom and is too stupid to realize that it has enough under
 some conditions.  For example, I was testing a C315M laser head that
 could do 107 mW at the diode current limit but would not stabilize unless
 the power was set to less than 100 mW.
</ol>
<p>
The Analog Controller is basically a set of regulated switchmode power
supplies based on the Linear Technology LTC1149 High Efficiency Synchronous
Step-Down Switching Regulator.  (The datasheet may be found on the
<A HREF="http://www.linear.com/">Linear Technology Web Site</A>.
There are about 20 power MOSFETs presumably driven by the 3 or
4 LTC1149s.  Efficiency is quite high and heatsinking is minimal - just some
close contact with the back plate using those white silicone pads.  Nothing
seems to run very hot so this is adequate.  However, I did repair one
controller with a blown MOSFET, possibly due to inadequate pad-case contact.
<p>
While I expected to find some sort of microcontroller or PIC inside to do the
control, search, and monitoring functions, there is none as far as I can see,
only a pair of GAL16V8D PLDs (Programmable Logic Devices).  One of
these handles the basic interface and status functions while the other (by
process of elimination) must implement the state machine for the control
algorithm.  It resides on a little circuit board along with a pair of
non-volatile Xicor (now Intersil) X9C103 digital pots,
presumably to save the power setting and something else, and some glue logic.
There are also a number of Texas Instruments chips on this PCB
and the main PCB.  They are marked "272BC", "27M2BC", or "372C".
and are in an 8 pin surface mount package.  Their full part
numbers are probably TLC272B (op-amp), TLC27M2B (opamp), and TLC372
(comparator), respectively.
<p>
Except for the GAL programming, everything else is
standard and replacements are readily available.  I don't know if the GALs
have had their security bit set but if not, the program could be read out.
Even the GAL for the user interface is not a simple combinational circuit
though.  But the real problem in attempting any sort of repair on this unit
would be the packaging.  The 4 layer main PCB (3 signal layers and ground) is
very densely packed with both through-hole and surface mount parts.  The
majority of the 20 or so power MOSFETs are soldered to the back of the PCB
while some parts on the front are mounted on top of other parts.  Large
electrolytic capacitors, toroidal inductors, and a power relay cover up all
of these and are fastened with RTV silicone.  (See the photos via the link
above.)  Tracing the circuit would be very difficult to impossible but if
the future of the Universe depended on it, might be accomplished within
one's lifetime. :)
<p>
The one subsystem that can be analyzed is the interlock relay (not present
on some older versions).  It is, to put it mildly, bizarre. :)
The relay is from NAIS (now part of Panasonic).  A datasheet can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.mew.co.jp/ac/e_download/control/relay/power/catalog/mech_eng_sfw.pdf">SF
Polarized Monostable Safety Relay</A>.  The specific part is an SF4-DC5V
having 8 poles with 4 SPST NO (form A) contacts and 4 SPST NC (form B)
contacts.  The key feature of this relay is that a failure of a set of contacts
remaining welded closed will force certain other contacts to remain open,
others to operate normally, and guarantee there can't be short circuits
between contacts.  Two sets of NO contacts in series are the actual
circuit which the relay switches - presumably power to other parts of the
controller.  If one of these contacts were to be welded closed, operation
shouldn't be affected since the other contact will continue to function
normally.  Power to the relay coil is enabled by a signal
to a MOSFET and disabled if the voltage to the switched circuit goes above
about 9 VDC.  So far not too strange.  However, power for the relay coil
itself first passes through a series string of *4* sets of NC contacts <i>all
in parallel with a series string of *2* sets of NO contacts</i>, and a
large electrolytic capacitor across the relay
coil maintains power to it during the switching period.  In the world
of logic, such a set of conditions forms a true, 1, or tautology. :)  Only
if a contact malfunctions, will this peculiar contact arrangement have
any effect.  Presumably, the intent in the design was to assure that a
malfunction of the relay would be fail-safe and disable the laser.  But
figuring out exactly what the effect should be is no easy task especially
since the datasheet appears to be a poor and incomplete translation from
Japanese!  Further analysis is left as an exercise for the student. :)
And unfortunately, it seems that this relay is itself the likely cause
of an intermittent controller.
<p>
Interestingly, it may be possible to <i>listen</i> to the controller and sort
of tell what it's doing.  Really!  Well, at least on some units.  Since it
is basically a collection of switchmode step-down converters, vibrations at
the switching frequency for each converter (which changes based on its output
current) may be audible depending on how its particular magnetic components
are mounted.  Someone pointed out the sound to me asking if it might be a
problem.  After confirming similar behavior in two different controllers,
I replied: "It's a feature, not a bug". :)  The sounds are similar to
bird calls, though I am at a loss to suggest a particular species.  They
may be a sort of tweeting or twittering, rising and falling in pitch.
Higher pitch means more current to a particular TEC (or possibly the laser
diode though I have no confidence of ever having heard any sound directly
related to the laser diode).  During a part of the search phase, there may
be a sawtooth (in pitch) whine with a period of a second or two.  This is
likely from the TEC driver for KTP temperature.  The sound level isn't
high - the room has to be perfectly quiet (all fans off) to have a
reasonable chance of hearing it at all.  And, not all units are equally
loud (or soft) in each phase.  Some may be totally silent.  And, if the
DC power source is a switchmode power supply, it may make more noise
than the controller.  In short, your mileage may vary.  A stethoscope
should help.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315w">C315M Laser Head/Controller Cable Wiring</A></h4>

Complete Compass-M systems normally come with the required laser head
to controller cable.  However, if the stock Coherent cable is not available,
or if it is desired to construct a custom cable for testing/diagnostic
purposes, the following information will enable a cable for the C315M (and
C215M) to be built from readily available parts.
<p>
The 25 pins of the DB25 female connector are wired 1:1 to the first 25
pins (pin 1 on right facing the laser head) of the laser head connector.
<p>

<p>
This is the standard DB25 male pin numbering.
<p>
The cable is available from Coherent at a ridiculously high price (something
like $150 if you can get their attention).  However, if you are at all handy
with a soldering iron or crimp tool, one can be built from standard parts
for $25 or less.  Here are suggested parts to use:
<p>
<ul>
<li>DB25F (Standard DB25 female connector) - The bare connector is readily
 available from places like Jameco or Digikey, or salvage from a modem cable.
 (However, all the wires may not be present.)  A DB25F already wired with a
 flat cable (gray or multi-color) is also available from many sources but is
 much more expensive and the wire size may be marginal.
<p>
<li>Cable - Use either flat cable or individual wires.  Larger wire size is
 desirable for the LD and TECs at least (AWG #22 or #20 if possible).
 I don't know who makes the flat cable actually used in the Coherent cable.
<p>
<li>Single row connector for laser head - There are many options for this.
 I found some AMP parts from Digikey:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>30 pin single row housing - Digikey part number: A26981-ND ($1.57).
  Only 25 pins are actually required but using a 30 pin connector will make
  it more difficult to install the connector in the wrong position.
<p>
 <li>Female crimp pin - Digikey part number: A25977-ND ($2.00/10, 25
  are needed.  There are many types of pins with various contact force
  and plating options.  I think this one should be suitable - it isn't
  the cheapest or most expensive!).
 </ul>
<p>
 The $500 crimp tool isn't needed.  There is a $10 version, or just
 solder to the crimp pins taking care not to clog up the hole where
 the pin goes. :)  In fact, with the $10 crimp tool, soldering after
 crimping is probably a good idea in any case.
</ul>
<p>
Triple check your wiring.  One mistake could be disastrous!
<p>
I built a couple of cables from some parts that were taking up space
in my junk drawers - they work fine.
<p>
I built another cable using a piece of 25 conductor #22 ribbon cable from
<A HREF="http://www.alphawire.com/">Alpha Wire Company</A>.  Go to their
<A HREF="http://www.alphawire.com/pages/alliedelec.cfm?pn=3530">PVC Hookup
Wire Page</A>.  The type I used was 3533/7, which is a rainbow colored
30 conductor cable (peel off the extra 5 conductors from the edge that
is black).  Although the minimum order quantity from a distributor
is 100 feet, you can request a free sample by clicking on the 3533/7 link
and filling out the form.  The free sample is about 2 feet long which
is quite adequate for a C315M head cable.
<p>
For the controller, the following parts are needed:
<p>
<ul>
<li>DB25 female shell for crimp pins: Jameco 38771CF.
<li>Female pins for D-sub: Jameco 43369CF (25 required but order some spares).
<li>Crimp tool: Jameco 99442CF (about $10).
<li>Inserter/extractor tool 10194CF (really only needed if you goof up).
</ul>
<p>
Peel each wire back about 2 inches and strip about 5 mm from the ends.
Crimp first using the #20-22 slot and then do a final smush in the #24-28
slot of the crimp tool.  Inspect all the crimps before
inserting into the correct holes of the DB25 shell.  As noted, soldering
in addition to crimping is probably good insurance.
<p>
For the C315M laser head end, the following parts are needed:
<p>
<ul>
<li>36 pin connector shell: Jameco 103157CF.
<li>Female pins: Jameco 100765CF (25 required but order some spares).
<li>Crimp tool, Jameco 159265CF (about $10 but I think the same tool used
 for the DB connector will actually work here).
</ul>
<p>
Since the shell has 36 positions and only 30 are needed, chop the connector
to 32 positions and fill the positions on each end with Epoxy to minimize
the chances of incorrect insertion.  Then label the pin 1 position.  Also,
the connector is quite tight since the blunt end male pins of the C315M
laser head are also a bit thicker than the pointed male pins for which
these female pins are designed to mate with.  It might be better to
split the shell approximately in half to ease insertion/removal (i.e.,
12 and 13 pins each since positions 26 to 30 are not used).
<p>
Peel each wire back about 1 inch and strip about 5 mm from the ends.
Crimp first using the #20-22 slot and then do a final smush in the #24-28
slot of the crimp tool.  When inserting the wire into the pin, take care
that it doesn't extend much beyond the crimp portion and interfere with
the male pins of the laser head connector.  Inspect all the crimps before
inserting into the correct holes of the connector shell.  As noted, soldering
in addition to crimping is probably good insurance.
<p>
It took about 2 hours to build the first cable, some of this being spent
gaining proficiency with the crimp process.  It would probably take under
1 hour for subsequent cables.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315e">Wavelength Entertainment in the C315M Laser</A></h4>

It's interesting to watch the exact wavelength of the C315M laser as the
controller goes through its paces.  While I had a Burleigh WA-20 on loan
for alignment, I was able to watch various different lasers.  (See the
section: <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liawlm">Optical Wavelength Meters</A>.)
For the first C315M laser head I tested, the wavelength varied from 532.301 to
532.340 nm and then settled down at 532.337 nm.  That range of about 0.04 nm
is roughly 24 GHz at 532 nm or 12 GHz at 1,064 nm.  The FSR of the main C315M
laser resonator (from HR to OC) is only about 3 GHz.  Interesting....
This means that between the effects of the KTP and RES temperature control,
and the non-linear dynamics of the SHG process, tuning beyond the normal
FSR limit is taking place in this laser.  If the C315M output power were
varied slightly in real-time (by adjusting the P6 pot), the wavelength
would shift as the controller changed the KTP and RES temperatures to
achieve the desired power.  In this specific case, it just happened to
settle down near one end of the range.
<p>
A second C315M laser head was tested at both low and high power.  When set
at about 5 mW, its wavelength range was from about 532.240 nm to 532.320
nm, settling down typically around 532.305 nm.  When set at 90 mW, the
wavelength range was from 532.280 nm to 532.357 nm, settling in at 532.315 nm.
So, the wavelength range this laser is even larger - up to 0.080 nm -
48 GHz at 532 nm or 24 GHz at 1,064 nm, 5 times the FSR.
<p>
If you haven't noticed by now, these wavelength readings are not really as
close to 532 nm as might be expected, but average around 532.313 nm at full
power.  There are several factors that contribute to why the exact wavelength
displayed by the WA-20 isn't sitting right on the 532 nm that is almost always
quoted for green DPSS lasers and that we know and love:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The WA-20 is calibrated to read vacuum wavelength which is
 actually 632.991 nm even for a red HeNe laser whose wavelength
 in air is 632.81644 nm.  Applying the correction factor - the index of
 refraction of air or 1.00027593 - to 532 nm results in a green wavelength
 of 532.147 nm.  This alone accounts for almost 50% of the discrepancy.
<p>
<li>The actual wavelength of the dominant lasing line of Nd:YAG is
 not 1,064 nm, but 1,064.15 nm at room temperature, so when converted to
 green, this adds another 0.075 nm, shifting it to 532.222 nm.
<p>
<li>There is heating inside the Nd:YAG crystal from pump power absorption
 and the center wavelength of the gain bandwidth curve depends on temperature.
 In the practical range of +/-60 &deg;C, it linearly shifts to longer
 wavelengths during heating by 5x10<sup>-3</sup> nm/&deg;C.  From the
 tests on the second C315M laser head, it appears as though the average
 of the lasing wavelength shifts by about 0.035 nm at 532 nm or
 0.070 nm for the 1,064 fundamental between low and high power,
 and the low power already results in some temperature increase inside the
 Nd:YAG crystal.  So, call it 0.100 nm total from room temperature
 to operating temperature inside the crystal (an increase
 of about 20 &deg;C, which is quite modest - it could be more).  This shifts
 the green wavelength by another 0.050 nm to 532.272 nm.
<p>
<li>The actual gain-bandwidth for Nd:YAG consists of the primary line and a
 weaker line at 1,064.4 nm (at room temperature) they are close enough to
 result in a single joint line slightly shifted towards longer
 wavelengths.  I do not know by how much this impacts the effective peak
 of the gain-bandwidth function but it would only require another 0.041 nm
 green shift (0.082 nm in the fundamental) to make up for the differences
 observed.
</ul>
<p>
Note that the obvious explanation of WA-20 inaccuracies contributing
significantly to these discrepancies can probably be dismissed because
the instrument passes self tests and accurately reads a normal red 632.8 nm
HeNe laser.  For the method that is used to determine wavelength, this is
sufficient to guarantee better than 5 figure accuracy.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315b">Deciphering the C315M Laser Head Serial
 Datastream</A></h4>

There is an IR LED at the rear of the C315M laser head which sends out
a datastream generated by the microcontroller on the head PCB while the laser
diode is off.  Presumably this is some representation of the hour meter
reading and possibly other information which can be interpreted by an
appropriate program.  However, the relationship between the 0s and 1s,
and what they mean, is definitely not intuitively obvious!
<p>
I had looked at the transmitted code and couldn't make much out of it
other than the approximate number of bits and baud rate.  However, Rick
Everett had some free time on his hands and went a lot further.  Then,
fianlly Karol Luszcz put the last pieces together.  Skip down to his
entry if you don't want to bother with the gory details of the hunt. :)
<p>
(From: Rick Everett (rick@skyko.com).)
<p>
OK, I was really bored this morning, so I hooked up a photodiode to my TDS-210
digital scope and captured the output of the IR LED on my two C315M-100 laser
heads.
<p>
I started by tying pins 3 and 4 (laser diode cathode and anode) together and
connecting that through a 1K ohm resistor to +5 VDC.  This powers the base of
the NPN transistor which then saturates and sends a signal (LDOFF) to pin 4
of the 12C508 through a 1M resistor.  I also powered pin 21 with 6.1 volts
and pin 25 with 5 volts and pin 20 was ground for all.  The voltage on pin
21 flows through an emitter follower whose base gets the 5 volt reference
(cheap 5 V regulator).
<p>
OK, so...
<p>
When pins 3,4 are driven to +5 V, the yellowish LED on the head PCB comes on
and there is no output from the IR LED.  When pins 3,4 are grounded or left
floating, the yellowish LED turns off and the IR LED starts spitting out a
stream of data that repeats and does not change over time (measured for 30
minutes or so).
<p>
From head SN# H980461 manufactured 04/98 I got:
<p>
Start of data (0=no IR, 1=IR):
<p>
<PRE>
101110  1111100  1110100  1011000  1100100  1000100  1110010  0001001  11110100
</PRE>
<p>
After the start chunk (101110) which is the same for both heads, the following
seven chunks of data start with a 1 ms off pulse from the IR led followed by on
and off pulses of varying length (but multiples of 3.5 ms).  For instance, a
1111100 would be the 1 ms off pulse followed by 17.5 ms of the IR LED on, then
7 ms of the IR LED off.  All of the intervals seemed to be 24.5 ms, except the
first (which had no start pulse) and the last (which was 28 ms).
<p>
Since the start (101110) and the end (11110100) were the same for both heads,
I am assuming these are just start and end conditions.
<p>
OK, back to head #H9280461.  I reconnected pins 3,4 to +5 VDC (yellowish LED
on) and waited some amount of time.  I got this data:
<p>
<PRE>
101110  1111100  1110100  1011000  1100100  1000100  1110010 *1111000* 11110100
</PRE>
<p>
Note that only the *denoted* value changed over this time.
<p>
I then reconnected pins 3,4 but this time for a precise interval (well, to a
few seconds) of 24 minutes.  Disconnected, I measured this data:
<p>
<PRE>
101110  1111001  1110100  1011000  1100100 *1111000* 1110010 *1101100* 11110100
</PRE>
<p>
This time the two *denoted* values changed.
<p>
I then switched to head H98112521 manufactured Nov 98.  On this head I
measured:

I think I cracked the Compass-M laser head's serial IR data-stream format.
IR ON is a logic 0 and the data are little endian, so inversion and
flipping bits that Rick Everett made are OK. Also the first six and
last eight bits of the stream look to be the start/end conditions
just like he noticed.  Then we have 7 words of 7 bits.  Each word
besides the sixth one starts with 11 end ends with 0.  Four bits
between 11 and 0 is a digit in BCD format.  The sixth word (always
1011000) is a point.  So this is a number in 00000.0 format!  The
last digit (the one after a point) is a 10th part of an hour -
according to the bit streams Rick Everett has above, it's incremented every 6
minutes.  I'm not sure if this is IT but it looks to be.  My laser head was
manufactured in November, 1999 and it had been working in a computer-to-plate
system.  According to the method I described, it's running time is 3972.4
hours.  Here is the conversion:

to my PC's sound card. This looks like RS-232.  There is
always a 1 at the beginning of the word and 0 at the end, so it looks exactly
like RS-232 frame with one stop, one start and five data bits.  Moreover,
one bit in this stream is 3.33 ms long and that matches 300 baud rate!  It
would be nice to read the running times of these heads with only a notebook
with a photodiode hooked up almost directly to the COM port. :) But I didn't
check if it works in fact.

<h3><A NAME="sclc315p">Powering the C315M Laser Head with a Non-Standard
 Controller</A></h3>

Without a doubt, the best way to power these Compass-M lasers is using the
compatible Coherent Analog Controller.  However, where this is not an option,
it is possible to do it with either a controller constructed from
scratch, or with commercial modules, or a lab-style instrument.  For
information on cobbling together a system just for testing, also see the
sections starting with: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsm">Coherent Compass-M
Green DPSS Lasers</A>.  The following applies directly to the C315M, and
with some simplification, to the C215M.  It probably applies to the C415M
as well, but since C415M lasers are somewhat uncommon, I have not gotten
up the enthusiasm to determine the wiring or functions in detail.  And, the
only C415M heads I have are very weak, even weaker, and dead. :)

All other pins should be left unconnected.
<p>
Note: The C215M laser head is very similar to the C315M but lacks the
following:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>RES TEC (pins 18 and 19):</b> These pins are open.
<p>
<li><b>RES thermistor (pin 8):</b> This pin is internally tied to the
 LD thermistor on pin 5.
<p><li><b>RES temperature setpoint circuitry (pin 7):</b> On some samples,
 the P3 pot and its biasing network are completely missing from the head
 PCB, though the pads are there.  Others have all these installed,
 but presumably they serve no purpose.
<p>
<li><b>Upper LD TEC (pins 12 and 13):</b> These pins are open.
</ul>
<p>
The laser diode and TECs are isolated from everything else and can be
treated independently.
<p>
However, the temperature sensors are all connected to pin 23 (Common)
and cannot be isolated.  So, any driving scheme must take this into account.
To use the temperature sensors in resistance mode (as opposed to monitoring
a voltage), either jumper pin 25 (pullup +5 VDC when used with Coherent
Analog Controller) to pin 23 (Common) and treat them as 5K thermistors with
a funny response, or remove the 10K ohm pullup resistors on the head PCB.

<h4><A NAME="sclsgtcm1">Sam's TEC Controller Module 1 (SG-TM1)</A></h4>

This is a proposal for a PCB based on the Maxim MAX1968 TEC Controller
IC and is only a slight modification to their basic App note and evaluation
board.  I may pursue it if there is enough interest.  However, the evaluation
board costs about $100 and there are TEC controller modules from various
manufacturers in this same price range.  Thus, the need would appear to be
marginal at this point.
<p>
SG-TM1 will be capable of +/-3 A at +/-5 V using a 10K thermistor with
the temperature setpoint provided either by an on-board pot or an
external reference (e.g., a C315M laser head).  Where the external
reference is used, the on-board pot may be optionally used as an
offset.
<p>
For use with the C315M, the two LD TECs must be wired in parallel
so that the +/-5 V compliance range provides adequate headroom.
The compliance range for the RES TEC is somewhat marginal but
should be acceptable as long as the laser head is on a good
heatsink and you aren't in a hurry for it to stabilize.  But once there,
it should be fine.  For the C215M, the single LD TEC should work with
the 3 A current limit.  I don't know enough about the C415M to
conclude anything.
<p>
I don't really recommend using this board for the KTP TEC as it's
total overkill.  The L272 power op-amp is more than adequate and the
same part used in the Coherent controllers.  See:
<A HREF="tec1sch.pdf">Low Power TEC Controller</A>.
<p>
SG-TM1 could, of course, be used with other commercial lasers or
home-built DPSS lasers as well.
<p>
I estimate the cost of parts for this board to be less than $25 including
the PCB.  All parts will be through-hole for convenience in modifications
or repair, except for the MAX1968, which only comes in a TSSOP-EP
package.  So SMT assembly procedures must be used and it is a very small
part with closely spaced leads.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315c2">Powering the C315M with the C215M Analog Controller</A></h4>

We know how much of a pain driving the C315M laser head is with anything
but the Coherent Analog Controller.  As a couple of recent postings on
<A HREF="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</A> have
demonstrated, it is quite possible but those who have succeeded (and those who
have given up!) in all likelihood would agree that using the Coherent
controller would have been much preferred except for the challenge and
reward aspects of such projects if it weren't for availability and cost
issues.
<p>
However, some C215M controllers have recently shown up surplus
and my objective was to figure out if these could be used with the higher
power and more complex C315M laser heads.  Originally, I had thought
that it was probably foolish to even try.  But that proved not to be
the case and the quick answer is: Yes, it can be done with a trivial wiring
change to the cable, and for best stability, the addition of an external
TEC driver for the RES TEC since this is not present in the C215M laser head.
<p>
The Coherent Analog Controller for the C215M laser is a smaller, lighter,
and a much simpler device than the one for the C315M.  The major functional
differences are (1) a driver for only a single LD TEC, rather than the dual
LD TEC stack of the C315M, and (2) no driver for the optics platform
(resonator or "RES") TEC stack since there is no separate temperature
control for this in the C215M.
<p>
C215M controllers may show up surplus by themselves at attractive
prices much below those for the C315M controller since C215M laser
heads are relatively uncommon.  However, the C215M controller does not
have all of the capabilities needed to drive the C315M laser head
in a stable manner except at very low power without at least some
modifications to the laser head wiring.
<p>
I first attempted to run a C315M-100 laser head at low output power (about
10 mW) using the C215M controller.  The laser did stabilize with the Ready
LED coming on but after a couple minutes, Ready went off and the controller
tried to readjust itself.  Unfortunately, with this laser head at least, the
reason it lost Ready was that the output power <i>increased</i> as the
internal temperatures drifted and eventually, went outside the window
for bringing it down to the setpoint power.  Like the C315M controller,
this one is also incapable of reducing laser diode current if needed, but
at least appears to not increase the current unnecessarily.  So, even though
the Ready LED wasn't on, the current remained the same.  However, this
still doesn't represent a desirable state of affairs.
<p>
There were two possible causes, both of which likely applied.
With the C215M controller, only the lower half of the TEC stack for
the laser diode is being driven and the thermal resistance of the
undriven upper LD TEC probably prevents the LD temperature from being
regulated properly.  This would mean that the laser diode temperature
could be increasing without any external indication of excessive case
temperature.  Furthermore, since the lower LD TEC is being driven but
the temperature is monitored far away at the laser diode, the thermal
response is very sluggish.  If the lower LD TEC weren't the one with
a higher impedance, and thus lower current, the control loop probably
wouldn't even be stable.
<p>
In addition, the C215M controller doesn't have a driver for the TEC
that controls the temperature of the optics platform (RES) in
the C315M.  So, the temperature of the
entire optics platform is probably not stabilizing but slowly drifting
over time.  Even a temperature change of a few 100ths of a &deg;C
can change the output power by 25 percent or more, and even one that
is much smaller can totally confuse the C215M initialization algorithm.
I do not know what the optics platform in the C215M laser
head is attached to, having never been inside of a C215M laser head.
In the C315M laser head, it's mounted on the RES TEC stack which is
attached to the baseplate.  It's likely that the optics platform and
LD of the C215M laser head are on the same substrate and thus share
the same temperature.  So, a separate controller might be
needed to drive the RES TEC stack to maintain the optics platform
at a constant temperature.
<p>
The next step was to figure out if a simple wiring change can force the
C215M controller to adequately drive both LD TECs, or if an auxiliary power
supply would be needed.  First, thinking it would be lower risk, I decided to
try the TECs in series.  I realized that the maximum cooling (and heating,
though that shouldn't matter) rate would be much lower running on a maximum
of 5 V compared to the 10 V or more for the C315M, but there would be no
chance of frying the controller if the parallel impedance of the two TECs
was too low.
<p>
So, I changed the jumpers on my C315M Laser Head Breakout Adapter (see the
section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315ta">Test Adapters for the Coherent
Analog Controller</A>) so that it would drive the two TECs in series.
(Controller pin 9 goes to laser head pin 9.  Laser head pin 10 is jumpered
to pin 12.  Laser head pin 13 goes to controller pin 10.)
I first tried running a laser head that I didn't care about (since it was
weak) should something really bad happen.  The main purpose was to determine
over what range of diode current, the LD temperature would regulate properly.
A multimeter was used to monitor the voltage across the LD TECs while running
the laser starting at minimum power output.  As it turned out, this
laser head would actually run quite well at any power setting up to
it's 25 mW or so max.  The LD temperature was easily maintained at
the correct value since the TEC voltage, which can vary from -5 V
(maximum heating) to +5 V (maximum cooling) settled
in at about 3 V even with the laser diode current near the 2.3 A current
limit. Despite no control of RES temperature, the laser output power was even
reasonably stable.  Though, every few minutes, it might jump around a bit,
probably as a result of the drift in resonator temperature.
<p>
Next, I swapped in my lab rat test head - one that is set to a maximum
output power of about 85 mW.  This was perfectly happy, LD temperature-wise,
up to a current of about 1.6 A sitting on a metal plate, or about 2 A on
a heatsink with some air cooling.  I suspect that the temperature setpoint
of the laser diode in this head is substantially lower than for the one
above, thus the more limited range of stable operation.  However, unlike
the weak head, it was quite obvious with this one that any change in
baseplate/heatsink temperature also has a substantial impact on output power.  
<p>
Up to a selected power of about 40 mW (50 percent for this laser), it would
initialize successfully and turn on the Ready LED, though the operating
current was generally somewhat higher than when using the C315M controller.
However, after a few minutes, as the baseplate and thus resonator warmed up,
the output power would jump to a higher value, and the Ready LED would go off.
But the laser diode current never increased, nor was there evidence of
any effort on the part of the controller to optimize the power setting once
it went above the selected value by more than a few percent (or maybe simply
because it was content with the initial stability after Ready went on).  So,
even though it was way outside the acceptance window for Ready, the power was
still reasonably stable and not jumping around.  Increasing the cooling with a
small fan, which by conduction though the RES REC stack also reduced the
temperature of the optics platform, reduced the output power implying that
the optimal resonator temperature was higher than ambient (as is usually
the case).
<p>
Here is some data:

</PRE>
<p>
* After a few minutes, the output power jumped up to these values, probably
due to drift in the optics platform temperature.
<p>
(For a more detailed explanation of the entries in this table, see the
section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315i">Typical C315M Pump Diode
Current</A>.  These two laser heads are also listed there.)
<p>
Next, after sleeping on it, I decided that trying the TECs in parallel would
likely work much better, even though the currents wouldn't be perfectly equal
compared to a series connection.  Before attempting this, I tested my only
C215M laser head to determine the current required by its LD TEC at 5 V.  In
fact, it appears as though the impedance of the C215M LD TEC is even lower
than the combination of the upper and lower C315M TECs in parallel!  The
only concern then became whether the current imbalance, which results in
a thermal imbalance, will be a problem.  In other words, the bottom of
the upper LD TEC and top of the lower LD TEC will be getting more heat
flow from the upper LD TEC than the lower LD TEC can remove, until its
temperature goes high enough that conduction through the lower LD TEC
makes up the difference.  I don't believe this will be a problem as
long as the laser is on a good heatsink.
<p>
Jumpering was even easier for this arrangement since there is already a
convenient header which can serve this purpose.  (Controller pin 9 goes
to laser head pins 9 and 12.  Controller pin 10 goes to laser head pins 10
and 13.)  And, indeed, this approach worked much better.  Thermal response
was much faster with none of the long delay
before stabilizing which was typical of the series connection.  At high
power, a small fan was still needed to keep the TEC drive voltage below
3 V, but this didn't seem to affect the laser's stability nearly as much
as it did with the series TEC configuration.  Why that should matter is
still a mystery.
<p>
In fact, as the data below show, in terms of output power versus laser
diode current near maximum power, this particular laser head at least is
working about as well as it would on the C315M controller:
<p>

 </PRE>
<p>
It would seem that for the LD temperature required for the laser diode in
this head, with the relatively cold heatsink (probably about 16 &deg;C)
there is enough conduction through the TECs that they actually have to
provide a bit of <i>heating</i> for operation below about 25 mW.
<p>
Over the course of at least a dozen power cycles at various power levels,
there have been no problems with reaching a stable condition at an
efficiency similar to that of the C315M controller driving this same laser
head.  And note that the only reason the output is lower than 100 mW is
that this specific laser head is not capable of operation much above
85 mW.  However, the results should apply equally well to perfectly healthy
C315M-100 lasers since the diode current at which it was running (around
2 A) is typical of normal C315M-100 laser heads at full power (actually on
the high side for most).
p>
So, next I installed a fully functional C315M-100 heads, one of my "visible"
heads that has a Plexiglas cover to show that the results, above, weren't
just a fluke. :)

<p>
These are listed in the order in which each of the power levels were tested.
Interestingly, though perhaps not that surprising, the first run at full
power had relatively poor efficiency but the last one actually outperformed
the same laser head on the C315M controller in terms of minimum diode current.
Also, for this particular head, cooling is almost a non-issue with the laser
head only sitting on an aluminum plate with no fins or fan.
<p>
I haven't let any of these run for hours as yet, but over
the course of a few minutes, there is little evidence of power
fluctuations, though I still expect there to some as the temperature
of the optics platform drifts.  The worst was the first run of head #100-130
where the power seemed to fluctuate by 1 or 2 percent and occasionally, the
power would dip or jump probably as a mode lock is lost and the controller
readjusted. But unlike the C315M controller which becomes
obsessive compulsive if the output power changes by even a fraction of 1
percent after Ready comes on, the C215M controller often seems content to allow
a slow drift and possibly even a jump in output power as long as the output
power doesn't go outside some acceptance window.  And even if it does, at
times the controller didn't appear to care all that much about it on the high
side at least, other than to take away Ready to signal its annoyance. :)
<p>
So, here are the conclusions from this exercise so far:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The laser diode current drive capability of the C215M controller is
 quite adequate for most or all C315M-50 and C315M-100 laser heads,
 and possibly for C315M-150s as well.  It was tested to 2.3 A but probably
 goes higher.
<p>
<li>It is possible to drive the two LD TECs of the C315M in series with the
 C215M controller up to a diode current based on the LD temperature setpoint
 and baseplate/heatsink temperature.  However, the response to temperature
 changes as the diode current is ramped up is much more sluggish with the
 limited voltage range of the C215M (+/-5 V) compared to the C315M
 controller (effectively greater than +/-11 V).  This results in typical
 efficiency (diode current versus output power) far from optimal.
<p>
 Driving the LD TECs in parallel appears to work much better in terms of
 thermal response speed.  For the particular C315M laser heads being used
 for testing, decent efficiency and stability were achieved without doing
 anything to the RES TEC.  However, this may not be true in general.
<p>
<li>Stabilization of the RES temperature will likely be required to achieve
 optimal performance with most C315M lasers.  I do not know if all of the
 specifications can be met under all conditions, but it should come close.
 However, as noted above, this may not require a fancy TEC controller.  Any
 of the commercially available TEC controller modules would suffice.  Or,
 if it is desired to construct one, the Maxim MAX1968 appears to be ideal
 for implementing a simple low cost controller, though its +/-5 V maximum
 drive to the TEC may be a bit marginal, or at least take a long time
 to stabilize.  Go to the <A HREF="http://www.maxim-ic.com/">Maxim Homepage</A>
 and search for: "MAX1968".  Another, slightly more complex but more flexible
 option is the Linear Technology LTC1923.  Go to the
 <A HREF="http://www.linear.com/">Linear Technology Homepage</A> and
 search for: "LTC1923".
<p>
 Also see
 <A HREF="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/redlum.xohp/electronics/315M/TEC.html">WL's
 TEC Controllers for the C315M-100 Page</A> for complete and tested designs
 using the MAX1968 and LTC1923.
<p>
 If stable operation most of the time, but possibly at somewhat lower
 efficiency and reduced output power is acceptable, regulating the
 heatsink temperature alone, or just keeping it cool, may be an
 acceptable alternative.
</ol>
<p>
So, as the final experiment for now, I wired up a
<A HREF="http://www.wavelengthelectronics.com/">Wavelength Electronics</A>
MPT10000 TEC controller partly because that was what I had handy and partly
because it is compatible with the Compass-M laser head PCB circuitry.  (The
lower power MPT5000 or even the MPT2500 would also be suitable.)
Unlike some other controllers, including the ILX LDC 3900, which require
at least one side of the sensor to be isolated, the MPT controllers
allow for both the temperature setpoint and sensor inputs to be voltages
(though the latter is not acknowledged in the instruction manual).  Thus, no
modifications to the laser head would be necessary.  Due to some
peculiarity in the design of the MPT series controllers, the setpoint input
has to be divided by 2 before being used.  Ideally, this should be done
with an op-amp so that the input resistance of the MPT doesn't affect
the voltage, but a high ohm pot (>1M ohm, to avoid loading the
C315M laser head PCB RES setpoint circuit) adjusted so the MPT Temperature
Monitor output equals the pot input works fine as well.  Using a pot with ot
without the op-amp would also allow some adjustment should the P3 head PCB
pot not be set exactly to the optimal setpoint.  (It doesn't need to be with
the C315M controller since the search algorithm will find it.)  As long as the
internal temperature setpoint pot is set low enough, there will be a
setting of the external pot that will work.  If an op-amp is used, then
the internal pot should be set to 0 (fully counterclockwise) so that the
external input fully determines the temperature.  Other than that, it's
just a matter of hooking it up.  The jumper in the MPT that sets the
sensor current must be removed so that the current is provided only
by the pullup resistor on the C315M laser head.  I set the current limit
jumper to 2 A and am running the MPT on the 12 VDC output of the same power
supply that runs the C215M on its 5 VDC output.  When run on 12 VDC,
the maximum voltage available to the TEC should be at least +/-10 V.
<p>
After remedying a couple of minor bloopers in my wiring, this unit
regulates the RES temperature quite well, though it does take awhile
to reach equilibrium.  The RES temperature usually is set to be higher
than 25 &deg;C so heating is required.  This actually goes faster with
the laser running since part of the heat is provided by the pump beam
and the waste heat from the laser diode through its TECs helps as well!
<p>
To be conservative, I allowed the RES temperature to stabilize before
turning the laser itself on (though since heating is usually involved,
this would actually go faster with the laser on).  Once this was done,
the two C315M heads in the tables above run on the C215M controller behaved
in all respects that I could easily test quickly, in an identical manner
to a C215M on a C215M controller.  They reached full power at a diode
current similar to operation with a C315M controller and over the course
of several minutes, there was absolutely no instability whatsoever.
The only quirk may be that usually, though not always, the diode current
tends to be a bit lower (a few percent) if the Power Set button is pressed
again to initiate another ramp-up after the laser stabilizes from a cold
start.
<p>
When run with RES temperature regulation, I'd expect the stability to be
similar to that of the C215M laser head on the C215M controller, which
should be pretty darn good.  For light show and other
applications where single frequency operation and constant power aren't
critical, this may not be needed.  But for holography or interferometry,
it would certainly be desirable and possibly essential.
<p>
I have only run this scheme on a few laser heads so far, not nearly as
extensively as with the C315M controller, but all the indications are that
it should be fine.  The laser head sees virtually the same conditions as it
would on the C315M controller and the C215M controller maintains its cool
with at most a small heatsink, even with the laser running at full power.
While I haven't explicitly tested for single frequency operation, given
the design of the C315M laser head and the good stability, there is every
reason to expect that the laser is operating with a single longitudinal
mode and is not running multimode or mode-hopping.
<p>
I later constructed a dedicated adapter intended to go inside the shell of
an obsolete dongle (parallel port software key) if I can find one. :) It
goes between the C215M DB25F and the head cable DB25M, with a separate
connector for the MPT.  There are test points for the LD TEC and RES TEC
voltages, and the RES setpoint and sensor (via the MPT monitor pins).
See <A HREF="c215mwd1.gif">Wiring Diagram for Using C315M Laser Head on

is wired 1:1 for <b>ALL</b> pins except as noted below:

<p>
A C315M Laser Head Signal Breakout Adapter could esily be modified for
this purpose as well.  See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315ta">Test
Adapters for the Coherent Analog Controller</A>.
<p>
Note that a much simpler and cheaper TEC controller would be equally as
effective as the MPT.  The $350 or so MPT was really only used because
it was handy.  It should be possible to construct a unipolar
driver (only heating since that's what is generally required for the RES TEC)
for under $10.  The only disadvantage is that it may take somewhat longer to
reach equilibrium without being able to hit the TEC with reverse current.
See <A HREF="tec2sch.pdf">Unipolar TEC Controller</A> for a
basic design.  As drawn, it should be capable of 2 or 3 A at up to 12 V
using a 15 V power supply for +V Power but can easily be modified for
different requirements.  This unit is directly compatible
with the Compass-M TECs and head PCB signals, and can be configured for
heating or cooling via jumpers.  (It should also be able to drive the LD
TECs in series since only cooling is really required except possibly at
very low outuput power, but of course, a separate LD TEC controller is
not needed when using the C215M controller.)
<p>
The beauty of using the C215M controller with a separate TEC controller
for the RES compared to an LD driver and a bunch of TEC controllers is
that it still has enough smarts to quickly find the optimal operating
conditions so laser heads can be swapped without worrying about readjusting
a bunch of settings.  In fact, it does this more rapidly than the C315M
controller since there is one fewer degree of freedom for it to worry
about.  And, as with the C315M controller, the output power is maintained
nearly constant.  
<p>
Another side benefit of the C215M controller is that should something go
wrong, repair is possible (as opposed to the C315M controller which is
basically not repairable).  The C215M controller PCB has a wide open layout
and uses standard parts in its power driver circuitry.
<p>
So, while I wouldn't recommend using the C215M controller with the C315M
laser head for someone who just wants a turn-key system that can be set up
and left alone with the best stability, this can represent a viable
alternative for the experimenter who is willing and able to make
the needed modifications, understands the requirements for keeping the
system happy, and enjoys the rewards of doing something non-standard while
saving money at the same time.  It could also be useful for quick testing
of C315M laser heads since the output stabilizes in about one third the
time compared with the C315M controller.
<p>
CAUTION: If you do change the wiring to the C315M laser head to enable use of
the C215M controller, make sure you don't forget to change it back if using the
C315M controller.  I doubt the controller or laser head would be very happy
otherwise!  Or, rather than modifying the cable or laser head, build an adapter
consisting of a DB25M and DB25F built into the shell of an obsolete dongle
(parallel port software enable key).

<h4><A NAME="sclcchbc">Powering the C315M Laser Head with a Home-Built
 Controller</A></h3>

To properly drive any of these laser heads without the Coherent power supply,
the following will be required.  (The "basic version" is open loop for power
output and may have less long term stability than the "optimized version".
The specific description is for the C315M and should be similar for the
C415M.  It should be simpler for the C215M as there is no RES TEC.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>A constant current laser diode driver for the pump diode with an output of
 about 1.5 A maximum current will suffice for the basic version.  For the
 optimized version, modulation capability will be needed to handle optical
 feedback.
<p>
<li>A controller for the pump diode TECs for cooling and temperature tuning of
 its wavelength.  Hopefully, a single controller will suffice for the upper
 and lower TECs in series.  A controller that maintains a constant temperature
 using thermistor sensor feedback will suffice for both versions.  Note that
 since the C315M is a Nd:YAG (not Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>) based laser, temperature
 tuning of the pump diode wavelength is fairly critical as the YAG absorption
 band is much narrower than that of vanadate - the peak is between 809 and 810
 nm with the output power down by 40 percent at 807 and 810 nm.
<p>
<li>A controller for the KTP TEC which will adjust its temperature to maintain
 peak output power/minimize pump diode current.  A controller that maintains a
 constant temperature using thermistor sensor feedback will suffice for the
 basic version.  Modulation capability (can be done via the sensor input)
 may be needed for the optimized version.
<p>
 Since the KTP TEC is very small, a simple op-amp circuit can be used here.
 A suitable circuit is shown in <A HREF="tec1sch.pdf">Low Power TEC
 Controller</A>.  This circuit is derived from the design used in the
 Coherent Compass 532 laser (see the next section).  I have made minor
 simplifications but retained the original 1% resistor values - the nearest 5%
 values should be just fine.  R1, R2, and R3 can be eliminated if the KTP
 Temperature Setpoint output on the laser head PCB is used.  Even this circuit
 is probably somewhat more complex than necessary but the total cost should be
 under $10 even if you lost the keys to your junkbox. :)  The "Offset" input
 may be useful later when power optimization is implemented.  Note that this
 circuit is only suitable in its current form for very small TECs - typically
 these are less than 1 cm square.  However, if wasted power isn't an important
 consideration, a pair of power buffers can easily be added to drive larger
 TECs.  CAUTION: Circuit copied quickly - errors are possible! Use at your
 own risk.
<p>
 CAUTION: Make sure that any driver circuit limits average power into the
 TEC particularly in the direction which results in heating of the low
 (thermal) mass KTP to avoid damage to it or even an unsightly melt-down.  The
 circuit, above, has protection for this but other power sources including
 expensive commercial ones must be set up to stay within safe limits
 (which may be more conservative than necessary if just based on a maximum
 current).
<p>
<li>A controller for the cavity TECs which is also getting rid of the small
 amount of waste heat from the KTP TEC.  A circuit that maintains a
 constant temperature using thermistor sensor feedback will suffice for both
 versions.  Where a good heatsink is used and ambient temperature is modest
 (e.g., 20 to 25 &deg;C), this shouldn't require very much power.  In fact,
 just providing a constant current may be adequate if the temperature of the
 baseplate is nearly at ambient.
<p>
<li>A large heatsink with enough forced-air cooling to maintain the
 temperature of the laser baseplate near ambient.  Note that good heatsinking
 is needed not only to allow for proper heat dissipation but to avoid major
 interactions between the control loops of the two large sets of TECs, which
 may lead to instability.
</ol>
<p>
As an example of a very nice complete solution, see <A HREF=
"http://perso.wanadoo.fr/redlum.xohp/electronics/315M/Compass315M.html">
WL's Controller for the Coherent 315M-100 DPSS Laser Head Page</A>.
Complete schematics and PCB layout artwork are available for free
download to fully control the C315M (any power rating) laser
head via a USB PC interface.  The LD driver is a Wavelength Electronics
WLD3343 (see the next section).  The TEC controllers are based on either
Maxim MAX1968 or Linear Technology LTC1923.  Now, all we need is
the active search software to locate the optimal operating point! :)
However, WL notes that this was much more work than anticipated.  Geez,
really?  Didn't I say that? :)  So, obtaining the Coherent C315M
Analog Controller or adapting the C215M Analog Controller would be
much easier and probably even much cheaper if you value your time at anything
above $0.00/hour, and they both do the search for you and maintain output
power constant.

<p>
For my C315M laser heads I have built a single PCB unit based on MPT series
controller by Wavelength Electronics, modified to Burr-Brown OPA power
op-amps.  (These have current limiting facility built-in). It's linear,
not PWM, but after thermal stabilisation power dissipation of this part
isn't high.
<p> 
There's also a commercial MLD linear Laser diode driver (2.5 A) with
supply voltage of 13 V so most power is wasted there.
<p>
Jumpers on PCB select either the pot setting of the C315M laser head PCB
or a local (multiturn pot) setpoint for each temperature.
<p>
With this unit I'm able to work without mode-hopping after about 10
minutes of quarantine. :-) But there's got to be a fan inducing some
vibrations. Perhaps I'll be able to stop it for like 20 seconds to
shoot a hologram.  If I find more time. :-)  See

<p>
I have built a complete controller for the C315M using two
<A HREF="http://www.teamwavelength.com/">Wavelength Electronics</A>
TEC controllers and laser diode driver.  The KTP temperature uses the
<A HREF="tec1sch.pdf">Low Power TEC Controller</A>.  I use a 12 V to 5 V
<A HREF="http://www.meanwellusa.com/">Mean Well</A> DC to DC converter
on-board allowing the laser diode driver to run efficiently and stable
with an input voltage from 9 to 17 VDC.  The total power consumption is
around 25 watts or less at room temperature.

<h4><A NAME="sclccwel">Powering the C315M with the Wavelength Electronics
 WLD-3343 and WHY-5640</A></h4>

A professional implementation of the basic version of this
system could always be put together for under $500 using off-the-shelf
modules from <A HREF="http://www.teamwavelength.com/">Wavelength
Electronics</A>.  The
WLD-3343 laser diode driver and the WHY-5640
temperature controller would be suitable and cost under $150 each in single
quantities.  (I see little point in using the more complex, more expensive
WTC-3243.)  However, note that since the thermistors are not isolated from
each-other (there is a common connection for all of them and pullup resistors
to +5 VDC), the WHY5640 may need to be configured in a way not documented in
the datasheet.  (This caution would also apply to fancy lab-style multiple
channel laser diode/TEC controllers.)  And, to use the automatic settings
specified on the C315M PCB, some simple additional circuitry will be needed
to convert the difference between the setpoint and sense voltages to a signal
the WHY5640 can use (under development).  Using one of these modules (or an
equivalent from another well-known company) would be a good investment for
at least the pump diode which is very easy to destroy, as well as its TEC.
<p>
I would think twice about using cheapie laser diode drivers for use with this
expensive laser.  They may have little or no protection and tend to fail
shorted.  The large TECs are much tougher to damage than laser diodes and with
care, any decent commercial or home-built controller, or even a simple constant
current or constant voltage supply, may be adequate at least for testing.
However, since the laser diode's health is directly affected by its
temperature, using a commercial driver for it's TEC would also be prudent.
The very small KTP TEC <b>can</b> be easily destroyed by too much current,
particularly in the heating direction, so care must be taken with its driver.
One option is the <A HREF="tec1sch.pdf">Low Power TEC Controller</A> but
WHY5640s can be used for all three TECs if desired.
<p>
For the optimized version, feedback will be required to control pump diode
current and fine adjustment of KTP temperature.  LD and cavity TECs should
still run in constant temperature mode.  In the Coherent Compass 532 laser,
KTP temperature is controlled by a secondary feedback
loop to peak output power and pump diode current is maintained at a level
which provides the spec'd output power.  The C315M optimizes LD, KTP, and
resonator temperature and then uses a combination of LD current and LD
temperature to maintain output power at the setpoint value.
Just make sure any feedback control of LD current has an effective
current limit and it's set to a safe value for the diode.  Setting it
to 2.4 A would be acceptable for all the C315M heads I've looked inside,
where the green lasing threshold, operating, and maximum current values
are marked on the laser diode box.  Values ranged from 2.43 to 2.69 A.

<h4><A NAME="sclccilx">Powering the C315M with the ILX Lightwave
 Model LDC-3900</A></h4>

The following also applies with slight modifications to driving the C215M
laser head (described below) and for the C415M as well (but you're on your
own for that).
<p>
The <A HREF="http://www.ilxlightwave.com/">ILX Lightwave</A> model LDC-3900 is 
laboratory-type system which can be configured with up to 4 laser diode
drivers or TEC controller or combined modules.  (Go to the link, above, and
check out the specifications under "Products".)  The system I used was
configured with a 4 Amp laser diode driver and three 32 Watt TEC controller
modules.  (For the laser I actually tested, a 2 Amp LD driver and 16 Watt TEC
drivers would have been more than adequate to run at rated output power.
This is probably true of the majority of C315M laser heads.)
<p>
One would think that a system with a list price of around $10,000 would
be easily configured for <i>any</i> laser but this is not the case.
There were two issues:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Non-isolated temperature sensors:</b> With the head PCB in place,
 neither side of the 10K NTC thermistors are totally isolated.  One side
 of each thermistor is connected to a pullup resistor (R6, R20, and R21
 in <A HREF="315cct1.pdf">Coherent C315M Laser Head Wiring</A>).   The other
 ends of the thermistors are connected together inside the laser head and
 cannot be separated.  However, according to the operation manual for the
 TEC controller module, this in itself isn't a problem as the LDC-3900 will
 operate correctly with one side of the sensors tied together as long as
 nothing else attached to its TEC connector is also wired to the common
 point.  This was confirmed by an email to ILX Tech Support.  Thus, there
 are two options.  Both of these approaches have been confirmed to work:
<p>
 <ol type="A">
 <li>Remove the pullup resistors from the PCB.  The disadvantage of this
  approach is that the resistors are very tiny surface mount parts and there
  is some risk in attacking the PCB with a soldering iron.  Furthermore, they
  would have to be reinstalled to run the laser on the Coherent Analog
  Controller.
<p>
 <li>Attach the +5 VDC pin to the Common pin.  This effectively puts a 10K
  ohm resistor in parallel with each temperature sensor altering the
  calibration of the thermistors.  This can be worked around by
  modifying the C1/C2/C3 constants (see below).  Or, just determine the
  equivalent temperature reading and use the existing C1/C2/C3 values.  Then,
  when done, calculate the actual temperature from the thermistor resistance
  at the optimal setpoint (assuming no 10K resistor were in parallel with
  it).  For an actual temperature of 25 &deg;C, the reading will be around
  40 to 45 &deg;C.  The TEC feedback loop will still work fine (even though
  the temperature readout is wrong) without changing the gain.
<p>
  The actual thermistor resistance (Rt) is given by: Rt=(Rm*10K)/(10K-Rm)
  where Rm is the measured resistance via the LDC-3900 readout.  The
  setpoint temperature is then given by the "Steinhart-Hart Equation"
  (see below).
 </ol>
<p>
 The C315M laser head I used for this experiment had no PCB - it had been
 physically broken off somehow (and lost).  Amazingly, whatever trauma was
 involved didn't result in any other obvious damage - the threshold current
 for green lasing was quite low (tested using just a laser diode driver with
 no cooling of the diode for just long enough to confirm operation)
 and the TECs, sensors, and anything else I tested for continuity appeared
 to be intact.  Thus, option (A) for dealing with the temperature
 sensors was implemented automatically.
<p>
<li><b>Temperature resolution:</b> The TEC controller modules I have
 available can only be set in increments of 0.1 &deg;C.  At least 0.01 &deg;C
 resolution is required to accurately peak the LD, KTP, and the RES output
 power response and 0.005 &deg;C or 0.002 &deg;C would be better.
</ol>
<p>
Once the sensor issue was dealt with, it was a simple matter to configure the
systems to drive the laser head.  The current limit for the laser diode was
set at 2 A since that should be a safe value (for the diode) with virtually
any C315M laser head.  Without the head PCB, there is no way to externally
determine the actual current limit.
<p>
The TEC operating temperatures were determined initially at low pump
current - not much above green threshold.  First the pump diode, then RES, then
KTP.  It was necessary to go back and forth several times to zero in on
the best settings.  Then, another round to fine tune them with increasing
pump current attempting to achieve the maximum output power at less than
2 A of pump current, or 100 mW, whichever came first.
<p>
Although the optimal LD temperature couldn't be determined precisely, it had a
more-or-less broad single peak and could at least be set fairly close.
However, adjusting the KTP temperature produced a periodic response with
up to a 2:1 or more variation in output power.  The period turned out
to be around 0.1 &deg;C.  The periodic ripples are superimposed
on a much broader response.  So, there were quite
dramatic fluctuations in output power as the temperature was gradually
changed and it wasn't possible to select out a particular peak with the
limited temperature resolution available.  The visual effect was similar
to the "fluffing and pulsing" seen with the Coherent Analog Controller.
The RES temperature interacts with the KTP and has a somewhat similar
behavior.
<p>
The parameters for the TEC controllers are shown below.  The C1/C2/C3
values are the defaults for the temperature feedback loop of the LDC 3900.
The current limits for the TECs are safe for the TECs but might
be a bit low for best response.  And, in particular, the one for the LD TEC
may not be sufficient to provide enough cooling at high pump current and/or
low LD temperature and/or with less than a really good heatsink.

<p>
The operating temperatures shown (T Set) resulted in the best performance
that could be achieved using the 0.1 &deg;C resolution of the LDC 3900
temperature controllers.  Of course, since the actual optimal temperatures
are unique to each laser head and can vary widely fron sample to sample,
listing them here is of little value but might be a starting point if no
other information were available.
<p>
However, the highest power that could be sustained after fiddling was only
around 75 to 80 mW at 2 A.  It was clear from the transient output power
fluctuations (peaking above 100 mW) as the temperatures were adjusted,
that better performance should be possible if the temperature resolution
could be improved.
<p>
So, time to cheat, just a bit. :)  Now for a tutorial:
<p>
The "Steinhart-Hart Equation" is one polynomial expansion that can be
used to reasonably accurately compute the actual temperature based on
the thermistor resistance:
<p>
<PRE>
   1/T = A + [B * ln(R)] + [C * ln(R)<sup>3</sup>]
</PRE>
<p>
or:

                       1
   T =  --------------------------------
         A + [B * ln(R)] + [C * ln(R)<sup>3</sup>]
</PRE>
<p>
The default parameters for the LDC-3900 which are what I used for normal
settings (not the funny settings, see below) are:
A = 1.125x10<sup>-3</sup> (C1=1.125), B = 2.347x10<sup>-4</sup> (C2=2.347), and
C = 0.855x10<sup>-7</sup> (C3=0.855).  (More information on temperature
calibration can be found in the LDC-3900 and TEC controller operation
manuals).  The default C1/C2/C3 constants work reasonably well
for the typical 10K NTC thermistor.  Where the sensors are in parallel
with 10K ohm resistors described in option (A), above, these constants
will need to be modified.  This is left as an exercise for the student. :)
(I have attempted to determine C1/C2/C3 values but since the non-linear
behavior of the parallel combination is not even close to that of any
NTC thermistor, the accuracy probably won't be that great (though this
really doesn't matter for determining the settings).  In addition,
there were problems with values for C1, C2, or C3 wanting to be outside
the acceptable range of the LDC-3900.)
<p>
For reference, here is a chart of the behavior of a typical 10K thermistor

<p>
To get around the limited temperature resolution, the C1/C2/C3 constants
were modified to fool the feedback system into
thinking it had 0.01 &deg;C resolution.  In the feedback equation,
C2 and C3 are multiplied by powers
of the thermistor resistance (R) so increasing C2 and C3 by a factor of 10
will increase the incremental sensitivity to setpoint changes by a
factor of 10.  C1 was then adjusted experimentally to put the readout
around ambient temperature at a reasonable value.  To minimize hunting
after large setpoint changes, it may be desirable to adjust the Gain
values as I did, though I'm not sure how much effect this really had.
<p>
CAUTION: With these changes to C1/C2/C3, the temperature setpoints and
readout have no easily deciphered relationship to actual temperature.
Thus it's especially important that the T Limit be set to a reasonable
value (with respect to the new C1/C2/C3 values!) and that the operator
be aware of reasonable setpoint and readout values.  Make sure the system
is set up to automatically shut off the laser if any T Limit is reached.
But, don't depend on this for protection!
<p>
Rather than determining how the temperature setpoint should be adjusted
to correspond to the previous values analytically, I just recorded the
thermistor resistances (R in the chart, above) at the original settings
(it's available at any time by pushing a button on the front panel) and
then adjusted the setpoint with the new constants to produce a similar
resistance.
<p>
With the increased resolution of 0.01 &deg;C, it was possible to find
new temperature settings to more accurately peak output power.  An output
power of 103 mW was achieved at a current of 1.95 A which is better than
average for the typical C315M laser heads listed in the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315i">Typical C315M Pump Diode Current</A>.
(Another factor of 2 or so in temperature setpoint resolution would be
desirable to even more accurately set the temperatures but probably
wouldn't make a huge difference in efficiency.)

<p>
While it is far from obvious, note that the new funny settings for KTP and RES
are nowhere close in actual temperature to those found with the original
constants.  Given the original coarse temperature resolution, this isn't
suprising.
<p>
After much fiddling, several combinations of (funny) temperature settings
were found that produced a similar output power of 103 mW at a slightly lower
current of 1.88 A:

</PRE>
<p>
The differences in the temperature of the LD TEC aren't really significant.
It would appear that there are many peaks in the response function
with respect to KTP and RES temperatures that are about equally efficient.
The response can be visualized as a lumpy two dimensional surface (ignoring
LD temperature) with peaks where the KTP response and RES response
intersect.  See the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315f">Birefringence
or Etalon Effect Used for Mode Selection in C315M?</A>
<p>
I'm not sure why (1) wasn't found
initially since it differs only trivially from the original settings.
While there are no doubt minor differences among these and the dozens
(or more) of others that could be found, unless you're a
purist, it probably doesn't matter very much.  However, based on
the low threshold current (about 0.63 A) for green lasing of this laser
head compared with the others that I have tested, a slightly lower Iop might
be possible.  But 1.88 A is still better than Iop for 75 percent of those
laser heads.  Of course, it's possible that the Coherent Analog
Controller (which is how those laser heads were powered for testing)
doesn't necessarily find a best solution either and manual searching
would do a superior job with those as well.  If infinite time were available,
that could be something to strive for. :)
<p>
There also seems to be a small inconsistency from one power cycle to the next,
requiring slight touch-up of KTP temperature (by a few hundredths of a &deg;C
in actual temperature).  It's possible that here again, a different local
maxima is being selected due to interaction of the three TECs and self heating
of the KTP due to the intracavity power.  (A similar randomness appears with
the Coherent Analog Controller.)  These are all very minor effects though.
<p>
Here is a general procedure for optimizing C315M temperature settings.
<p>
An adapter harness will need to be made up to attach the LD and
TEC modules of the LDC-3900 to the connector of the C315M laser head.
The LD driver requires an interlock jumper in addition to LD+ and LD-.  The
TEC controllers require the TE+, TE-, and the two sensor connections (with
thermistors, the polarity doesn't matter but it is best to be consistent
among the 3 modules).  The adapter harness is made up of a DB9M for the LD
driver, 3 DB15Ms for the TEC controllers, and a 30 pin SIL female connector
for the laser head.  My adapter harness was wired with the DB25M pinouts of
the Coherent Analog Controller so that a normal C315M laser head cable
could be used.  In fact, the DB25M has more than everything needed
to drive most low to medium power DPSS lasers as well as laser diodes,
I have built adapters to <i>it</i> for using the LDC-3900 with
the Uniphase uGreen laser and my medium power laser diode test rig.
<p>
The same adapter can be used for both the C315M and the simpler C215M
(and presumably for the C415M but I have not made any attempt to figure
that one out, given the relatively few C415M lasers out there).
<p>
However, for driving the C215M, a switch will need to be added to change two
sets of connections:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pins 12 and 13 (Upper LD TEC) must be shorted together if driving the
 LD TEC stack in series since this is not present in the C215M.
<p>
<li>Pin 8 (RES thermistor) should be disconnected because there is no
 separate RES thermistor in the C215M with pins 5 (LD thermistor)
 and 8 are tied together inside the laser head.  And, having two TEC
 controllers attached to the same thermistor will produce yet another
 temperature calibration (although, it turns out to be closer to the
 actual temperature compared to the unmodified laser head PCB! :)
</ul>
<p>
Output power is easily monitored from the Photodiode (PD) terminals on
the laser head.  It's best to feed these into a fast responding current
meter (typical sensitivity of the PD: 6 uA/mW) or better yet, wire up a
5 VDC power supply and 3K resistor to the PD so a voltage corresponding
to output power can be monitored on an oscilloscope:
<p>
<PRE>

               Output Power (~18 mV/mW)
               o +      - o
               |    3K    |        PD
    +5 VDC o---+---/\/\---+---&lt;&lt;---|&lt;|--->>---o Return

</PRE>
<p>
This is desirable because as the KTP temperature is changed, the output power
will fluctuate rapidly.  A typical DMM is too slow to catch the peaks unless
the temperature setting is changed inconveniently slowly.  But with a scope,
preferably a digitizing or storage scope, they can be detected so that the
corresponding temperature setting can be determined.  This would be trivial
for the Coherent Analog Controller since all it would need to do is store
the corresponding temperature setting whenever the new peak exceeded the
previous one.  Without that luxury, it will be a bit more tedious. :)
<p>
It may be best to perform the initial procedure using "normal" C1/C2/C3
constants so the temperature settings make sense.  Then switch to the
funny ones for fine tuning.  CAUTION: In either case, make sure that the
T Limits are set to reasonable values and that they are never exceeded.
The LDC-3900 will shut down the TEC(s) if T Limit is exceeded but won't shut
down the LD current automatically and it won't take long for it to overheat
to the point of being damaged!  That's your job.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Select initial temperatures for the LD, KTP, and RES TECs.
<p>
 If the original head PCB pot settings haven't been touched, using them will
 reduce much of the time and uncertainty in the remainder of this procedure.
 To determine the default TEC settings, power the PCB <i>only</i> with
 +5 VDC (pin 25 to pin 23) and measure the voltages on the temperature set
 pots for LD (pot P2, connector pin 6), KTP (pot P4, connector pin 14), and
 RES (pot P3, connector pin 7).  Then,
 R<sub>x</sub>=(10K*V<sub>x</sub>)/(5-V<sub>x</sub>) where x=LD, KTP,
 and RES.  The easiest way to convert these to temperature is to start with
 TEC<sub>x</sub> set at 20 &deg;C and then adjust it until the thermistor
 resistance (available by pushing a button on the LDC-3900 front panel)
 equals R<sub>x</sub>.
<p>
 If the pot settings aren't available, select an (actual) temperature of around
 20 &deg;C as a starting point for each TEC.
<p>
<li>Install the C315M laser head on an adequate heatsink with a fan for
 cooling.  Since the optimal temperature settings aren't known at this
 point, there's no way to know how much heat will need to be removed from
 the case.  If the pump diode needs to be cooled substantially, heat
 dissipation may be considerable.  If it needs to be heated (unlikely),
 the heatsink probably won't need to do much.
<p>
<li>Attach the LDC-3900 adapter harness.  Double check for correct wiring to
 the 30 pin head connector!
<p>
<li>Enable the LD, KTP, and RED TECs one at a time and confirm for each that
 the temperature is actually converging on the selected setpoint before
 proceeding to the next.
<p>
<li>Enable the LD current and adjust for a power output of 1/3 to 1/2 of the
 desired output power of green as long as the pump current is less than about
 1.5 A.  Else, adjust for 1.5 A and accept whatever power it produces as long
 as there is at least some.  Initial optimizing will be needed to obtain even
 modest efficency.  If there's no output at 1.5 A, something is probably wrong
 - check your wiring and/or knowledge of LDC-3900 operation.  Or the laser
 head may be damaged.
<p>
<li>Adjust the LD TEC to peak output power.  The response takes a few seconds
 so change it in increments of first 1 &deg;C, then smaller increments
 to find the peak.  This is the least critical of the temperature settings.
 Most likely, the LD will need to be cooled below ambient.
<p>
<li>Adjust the KTP TEC to maximize the output power.  A temperature
 variation results in a periodic fluctuation of output power on top
 of a broad response which is highest in the center.  The period is
 around 0.08 &deg;C but while the envelope has a overall central maxima
 and peaks near the center will tend to be of higher amplitude, there will
 be significant local variation from one peak to the next.
 So search around for the highest peak even if it isn't adjacent to the
 next highest one or exactly at the center of the overall envelope.
 The response of the KTP TEC is very rapid - a second or so
 for a small change so it's response can be visualized easily on the
 fast meter or scope as the knob is turned.  The finest temperature setting
 resolution will be needed to get anywhere close, but the overall trend
 will still be visible at 0.1 &deg;C.
<p>
<li>Adjust the RES TEC to peak output power.  The period is around
 0.04 &deg;C.  Since the laser head's RES response interacts with the
 KTP response, its envelope is much like that of the KTP TEC.  The RES
 TEC has a slow response, more like the LD TEC.  So be patient.
<p>
<li>Go back and forth between the KTP and RES TEC adjustments.  Check
 adjacent strong peaks on each one and then readjust the other control to
 maximize output power.  If an adjacent peak results in a higher power
 (for the same pump diode current), switch to that one and then repeat
 the process.  It's important to take notes during this process so as
 not to become hopeless confused!  However, note that I do not know for sure
 how critical the actual RES temperature is as long as the KTP temperature
 has been adjusted for maximum output power with respect to whatever RES
 temperature setting is used.
<p>
<li>Once the maximum output has been achieved at low power, it then is
 <i>NOT</i> simply a matter of turning up pump diode current to achieve
 full power at reasonable efficiency.  This is because the optimal temperature
 of the KTP (and possibly to some extent RES) is also a function of output
 power.  Changing the current by a significant amount will cause the response
 to jump over several peaks in the periodic KTP/RES response functions.
 Thus, if the initial best values are found at low power, the pump diode
 current should be increased slowly (perhaps to add 5 mW at a time) and
 the KTP and RES settings re-optimized for maximum output power at each
 current setting.  (This incremental approach appears to be the way the
 Coherent Analog Controller ramps up output power once the search phase is
 complete.)  If LD current is increased in too large an increment, or all
 at once, it may still be relatively easy to find the properl maxima though
 searching a few nearby peaks with respect to KTP and RES temperature
 will be required.
<p>
<li>Adjust the LD TEC temperature to again peak output power.  This won't
 change very much from the previous setting may still have a significant
 effect on output power.
<p>
<li>Finally, go back and fine tune the KTP and RES TECs for maximum output
 power.  These should require very small adjustments at this point.
</ol>
<p>
As noted above, the C315M head I tested using this approach operated at a
current of 1.88 A for 103 mW of output power.  This is better than 75 percent
of all C315M-100 laser heads I've tested running on the Coherent
Analog Controller.  I couldn't run this one that way to determine if my
settings were optimal - or if the Analog Controller would pick some
more mediocre operating point - because it is missing the head PCB.  (It
was physically broken off before I received the head and I don't even have
the pieces.)  For more on how I believe the Analog Controller does all this
in a few minutes (it took me a couple of hours!), see the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315a">Analog Controller for the C315M</A>.
<p>
At this point, it would be simple (at least in principle) to install a
head PCB (or the equivalent circuitry) and set the temperature pots for the
values that have been determined experimentally, and set the other pots
the same (or perhaps a bit lower for LD current limit and output power pots)
as on another C315M head.  The Analog Controller should then be able to
operate normally and the output power pot could be adjusted as desired.
<p>
So, the bottom line is that it is possible to use $10,000+ of lab equipment to
do this but by now, you're probably thinking it would have been worth spending
the extra money for the Coherent Analog Controller as that unit packs a lot of
special purpose intelligence into a compact lightweight package. :)
<p>
I then tried this stunt on another C315M laser head that had been
partially disassembled but it turned out to be a hopeless case.
Among other things: The gold plated case walls are gone - removed using
a Dremel tool by the previous owner - and I had to wire a connector directly
to the laser substrates; the Brewster plate had popped off, fell on the floor,
and was reinstalled; the diode was swapped from the dissected C315M laser head
whose photos are immortalized in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser
Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.94 or higher) under "Coherent Diode Pumped
Solid State Lasers"; and the first turning mirror came unglued.  Aside from
these minor problems, the head is in perfect condition. :)  However, it wasn't
totally dead.  True, the threshold for green lasing with the temperatures at
optimal settings was found to be 1.3 A and the maximum output power was around
10 mW at 2 A, but driving it with the LDC-3900 sure beat the
4 variable voltage power supplies (no temperature feedback) I had been using!
Someday I may attempt to determine what exactly is wrong as I don't believe
it is due to a weak or misaligned pump diode.  I later tested both diodes
and found them to be fine.
There could still be contamination on an inaccessible optical surface
(i.e., the HR mirror or rear face of the YAG rod) or even on the other
surfaces that I haven't cleaned adequately.  It doesn't take much to
kill power when there are 8 intracavity surfaces!
<p>
Later, I tested a pair of C315M-100 heads I had attempted to repair on the
LDC-3900.  These both had intact head PCBs but neither was totally healthy
so testing them on the Coherent Analog Controller wouldn't prove much.
<p>
To use the LDC-3900 with the head PCB in place, the thermistor pullups
must either be removed or have +5 VDC (pin 25) jumpered to Common (pin 23).
The result is a sensor with a 5K ohm resistance at around 25 &deg;C
resulting in a temperature reading of around 42 &deg;C using the default
C1/C2/C3 parameters and the incremental sensitivity around (actual) 25 &deg;C
is about 2 actual &deg;C for each unit in the readout.  However, the response
of this equivalent 5K thermistor as the temperature moves away from 25 &deg;C
is not at all close to a true 5K thermistor and I have so far been
unsuccessful in determining a set of C1/C2/C3 parameters that would
result in anything close to actual temperature values for the setpoint and
readout.  Thus, the values for "T Set", below, are not the actual temperature.
Nor do they have enough precision.  At least one additional digit of
resolution would be needed to accurately set the temperatures for
maximum performance.
<p>
On one of the laser heads, Turning Mirror 2 and Output Lens had popped off.
These were straightforward to reinstall.  However, it was then found
that the lower LD TEC was nearly open and had to be bypassed with a jumper
wire to be able to use the upper LD TEC.  This works well enough on
the LDC-3900 if the laser is on a good heatsink which is well cooled
so that the waste heat from the upper LD TEC can get through the dead
lower LD TEC.  But I'm not about to risk it on the Coherent Analog Controller.
However, on the LDC-3900, the settings below resulted in an output power
of 100 mW at 2.0 A of pump current:

<p>
With finer resolution in the temperature settings, somewhat higher
performance would likely be possible.
<p>
The other head had its OC Mirror popped off and a damaged KTP crystal.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strrrcmo">Reinstalling the OC Mirror
on a Compass-M Laser Head</A>.  After reinstalling and aligning the OC
mirror and replacing the KTP crystal from a certifiably DOA head,
the output is still low.  It is only producing about 10 mW at 1.5 A of
pump current on the LDC-3900 with the following temperature settings:

The head was also tested on the Coherent Analog Controller resulting in 25 mW
at 2.2 A (the third number engraved on the diode case, though the controller
did go up to 2.5 A producing 36+ mW.)  I set it for 21.5 mW which was at
2.13 A.  So, it's now officially a C315M-20. :)  While I didn't actually
compare the performance that carefully, I'd say that the results of the
5 minute controller algorithm were comparable to my hour long adjustment
procedure on the LDC-3900. :)

<h3><A NAME="sclc315s">Testing the C315M Laser Head for Single Frequency
 Operation</A></h3>

If the C315M is indeed single frequency (single longitudinal mode), it
would have a very long coherence length (likely to be many meters if not
hundreds of meters).  This would make an ideal holography or interferometry
laser.  I seem to recall that a couple of years ago, there was an extensive
discussion of the single frequency (single longitudinal mode) and coherence
length of the Compass-M lasers on Coherent's Web site but that has mostly
disappeared.  Perhaps, not all samples of the C315M could be guaranteed to
be single frequency at all times and all power levels as noted below.
Perhaps Marketing just thought it would be too confusing to the intended
segment of the marketplace.  The only current reference in support of single
mode operation is a comparison chart and the specification for the optical
noise - less than 0.25 percent RMS from 10 Hz to 1 GHz for the C315M and
C415M; and 0.5 percent RMS for the C215M.  This would most likely be orders
of magnitude higher if these lasers were not single longitudinal mode.  And
even the C415M would appear to be single frequency based on its noise spec.
<p>
I have heard from one holographer that ironically, in some ways, the coherence
length of the C315M may be too long.  That is, he found that even objects on
the far wall of the studio - way outside the desired field of view - came
out crystal clear in a hologram made with the C315M.  I suppose we'd all
like to have similar "problems". :)
<p>
However, there is also a report of a specific C315M mode-hopping continuously
with 30 percent fluctuations in output power at a several kHz rate even
though the Ready signal was asserted and the controller was happy.  I suspect
that this might have been due to just being very unlucky and the
Coherent controller running the laser near one end of the stable portion
of the gain curve with noise on the pump current kicking it back and forth
between modes.  The optimization circuitry would not see the rapid variation
in power - it would be averaged out.  Perhaps the ripple was excessive for
this unit.  Reducing the output power setting slightly eliminated the problem.
<p>
There are many ways to test a laser for single frequency operation.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioisfo">Testing a Laser for Single
Frequency Operation</A>.  If I had a photodiode with sufficiently high
frequency response that operated at 532 nm, the easiest would have been
to look for beats between longitudinal modes at the cavity FSR - about 3 GHz
corresponding to the 2 inch distance between the mirrors.  However, the
only high speed photodiodes I have are for IR and have no response to
visible wavelengths.  The one optical spectrum analyzer we have with
fine enough resolution also doesn't go down to 532 nm.
<p>
So, I set up a Michelson interferometer with one mirror on a precision rail
such that its position (and thus the path length difference) could be easily
adjusted over almost a meter.  A 40X microscope objective and 2 inch focal
length lens were used as a beam expander.  The beamsplitter was a prism
type from Melles Griot and the mirrors were first surface aluminum.
Initially, the system was aligned with a short
HeNe laser (Melles Griot 05-LHR-911) which probably has 2 or at most 3
longitudinal modes.  With this laser, fringes had high contrast at all
times when the path length difference was a multiple of the cavity
length.  But at some positions in between, the fringes would change
in shape and contrast as the tube heated up and the cavity length
increased with the multiple modes producing superimposed fringes.
<p>
I then substituted the C315M laser head powered by an ILX Lightwave LDC-3900
laser diode controller (1 LD driver, 3 TEC controllers) set for optimal
temperatures (see the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclccilx">Powering the
C315M with the ILX Lightwave Model LDC-3900</A>.).  With the C315M, the
fringes were always crisp and clear regardless of the path length difference,
and from just above threshold to over 100 mW of output power.  Having just
determined the settings for most efficient operation using the LDC-3900, this
setup was conveniently available and also allowed output power to be easily
and quickly changed.  There is no reason to expect the C315M laser head on the
Coherent Analog Controller to behave significantly differently with respect
to single mode operation since it's search algorithm should be at least as
effective at finding the optimal operating point.
<p>
It is truly amazing how non-precise a precision rail can be when you're dealing
with wavelengths of light! :)  The shape and number of fringes did change
dramatically as the mirror was moved - forcing constant readjustment of
its alignment.  However, when left alone, the fringe pattern was quite stable
and consistently of high quality.  This was true from zero path length
difference to the 1 meter or so limit of my rail, and any point in between
that I checked.  Varying the output power by changing pump diode current
resulted in some effects on the fringes but their clarity was not touched.
I didn't make any attempt to optimize the temperature settings while doing this
so it is likely there were significant changes in frequency and possibly even
mode-hops, but no evidence of multimode operation.  My expectation is that
single frequency operation would be most stable where the temperatures have
been tuned for peak efficiency.
<p>
I'm not sure how conclusive this test is, or whether it implies that
<i>all</i> C315Ms behave similarly.  However, the initial results were
definitely promising.
<p>
Next I set up a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI, TecOptics FPI-25)
which consists of a pair of partially reflective mirrors, one of which can be
moved along the optical axis by a PieZo Transducer (PZT).  A function
generator drives the PZT so that the cavity length of the SFPI can be
changed periodically by a few wavelengths.  When the laser beam is input
to one end of the SFPI and the other is monitored with a photodetector,
the response can be viewed on an oscilloscope.  If everything is *perfectly*
aligned (and the laser gods are in a favorable mood), the result is a waveform
where peaks represent positions where the SFPI cavity length is a multiple of
1/2 the wavelength of any laser modes that are oscillating.  In essense,
as the cavity length is scanned by a linear ramp, the longitudinal mode
structure of the laser is shown across the horizontal axis of the scope.
Or to put it another way, the SFPI acts as an optical tunable narrowband
filter which can be used to analyze the fine structure of a laser line.
In order to prevent aliasing effects, the SFPI cavity length has to be much
shorter than the cavity length of the laser being tested.  But the
resolution also decreases with a shorter SFPI.  So, there are tradeoffs. :)
For a summary, see: <A HREF=
"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/fabry.html">HyperPhysics
Short Tutorial on the Fabry-Perot Interferometer</A>.  For in depth
information, see the <A HREF=http://repairfaq.ece.drexel.edu/sam/CORD/leot/course10_mod05/mod10-05.html">CORD LEOT Module 10-5: Fabry-Perot Interferometers</A>.
<p>
For this test, the SFPI cavity length was set to be about 25 mm, a bit less
than half the length of the C315M cavity (55 mm).  This is short enough
to unambiguously differentiate between neighboring peaks due to the
FSR (Free Spectral Range = c/2*L) of the SFPI (about 6 GHz) and longitudinal
modes due to the FSR (about 2.7 GHz) of the C315M cavity, with better
than 1 GHz resolution.
<p>
For a single mode laser, there should be a clean single peak separated
by a distance determined by the spacing of the SFPI mirrors (the FSR of
6 GHz).  Indeed the C315M laser operated in stable single mode at any
power from lasing threshold to 100 mW or more and at almost any settings
of the TECs.  mode-hops were evident as the KTP or RES temperature was
changed.  Sometimes, just before a mode-hop, a momentary indication of another
mode might pop up but it couldn't be maintained.  However, in the steady
state, the C315M was very solidly single mode.  It is reasonble to expect
that other reasonably healthy C315M should behave similarly.
<p>
(From LEsioQ (Piotr.Kucharski@stream.pl).)
<p> 
I talked to a Coherent representative and he said the C315M is not strictly
single mode but has another mode sitting 1 nm away.  However, the power is
only 1% of the main line.  So this by itself would not cause a problem
for holography or interferometry, but is good to know (and may explain
why the words "single mode" were suppressed in some Coherent documents).
I wonder whether this may get significantly worse when one is adjusting
the laser by just playing with the currents and not specifically caring
about the spectrum.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
That's interesting.
<p>
The Coherent controller only adjusts the currents and temperatures with
respect to output power.  It doesn't care about the spectrum.  With proper
adjustment, I'd assume that the other mode could be totally suppressed,
if it exists at all.  I'm rather suspect of the statement above.  In
my tests, there were no other lines except when the main one was just
about to mode-hop or had just mode-hopped.  I do not know if I'd see one
at a 1% level though.
<p>
Even if there is another lasing line 1 nm away, unless it has high enough
gain, there will be no contribution from it.
<p>
I would speculate that what happened under certain conditions, they
did see another mode due to the controller optimizing only for power and
getting into a situation where the local maxima wasn't near the center of
the gain curve.  So, Coherent couldn't guarantee single mode operation and
rewriting the firmware would have been too costly.  Since the most common
application for the C315M is in the graphics arts, single frequency
operation is mostly irrelevant.  So, there are only a very limited number of
customers who really care. :)
<p>
(From: Bruce Constable (bconstable@sbcglobal.net).)
<p>
The C315M-100 seems happy and is making great holograms. I'm using a
CPU-type cooling fan on the heatsink with no detectable stability issues
at all.

<h4><A NAME="sclc315f">Birefringence or Etalon Effect Used for Mode Selection
 in C315M?</A></h4>

So, how does the temperature of the KTP (KTP TEC) and overall cavity (RES TEC)
control mode selection and single mode operation?  Without some form of
mode selection, the C315M laser would almost certainly operate with
multiple longitudinal modes because the cavity is long and the gain medium
is not at all the way at one end aginst the mirror.  It would not be single
requency, stability would be poor, and amplitude noise in the output would
be high due to mode competition enhanced by the non-linear behavior of the
KTP (the "green noise problem").
<p>
Most of what follows applies to the C415M (and probably to the C215M) as well.
<p>
The Coherent 315M cavity has an effective optical length of about 55 mm
resulting in a cavity mode spacing of only about 0.01 nm (2.7 GHz).  Since
this is much less than the 0.5 nm (140 GHz) gain bandwidth of Nd:YAG,
many modes would fit under the gain curve and oscillate simultaneously.
<p>
The KTP crystal is 5 mm in length.  The only other optical element between
the mirrors besides the Nd:YAG rod is a Brewster angle plate probably made of
fused silica (it has no detectable birefringence).  Thus, it is assumed that
the KTP plays a vital role in mode selection and this is accomplished by
controlling it's temperature and that of the overall cavity very precisely.
One thing is certain: Very small changes in the KTP temperature have a dramatic
effect on output power.
This is possible since although the phase matching condition is affected
by temperature somewhat, its response is very broad and can be set to be
near optimal (probably may its mounting orientation during manufacture)
while the much more sensitive mode selection condition is also satisfied.
<p>
Adjusting the temperature of the KTP TEC results in a periodic variation
in output power of up to 2:1 between peak and valley when running at a
diode current which will produce full power (100 mW) when everything is
optimal.  The temperature sensitivity is approximately 0.08 &deg;C.
<p>
Adjusting the temperature of the overall cavity (ceramic substrate)
results in a periodic variation in output power with a sensitivity of
about 0.04 &deg;C.
<p>
Adjacent peaks in either case are NOT similar in amplitude since the
modes of the KTP and cavity don't necessarily line up with the center
of the YAG gain curve (or so I assume).  Some subset of the intersection
of the KTP and cavity peaks results in optimal efficiency and maximum power.
<p>
There are two possible mechanisms by which the KTP could act as a mode
filter: birefringence or etalon.  Based on its appearance, the KTP crystal
looks like it is AR coated at both ends.  If so, there would be a negligible
etalon effect.  But, it's also possible that the AR coating are designed only
for 532 nm green and that it could act as an etalon for 1.064 nm IR.  KTP
is also birefringent (though this is often ignored in the introductory
treatment of green DPSS lasers.
<p>
In more detail:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A birefringent filter results if passage of light through the material
 results in a polarization change which is a function of wavelength.
 For this linear (Fabry-Perot) cavity, the polarization must undergo a
 rotation of an integer multiple of 2*pi for a double pass through the
 KTP to minimize losses.  The mode spacing of a birefringent filter in
 this configuration is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
                             (lambda)<sup>2</sup>
          delta_lambda = -----------------
                          2 * delta_n * l
</PRE>
<p>
Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>lambda is the free-space wavelength of the fundamental intracavity beam.
 <li>delta_n is the birefringence (difference between n<sub>o</sub> and
  n<sub>e</sub> of the material along the direction of the beam.
 <li>l is the length of the filter (5 mm).
 </ul>
<p>
For the C315M KTP crystal (l<sub>c</sub> = 5 mm, delta_n = 0.0857)
at 1,064 nm, this works out to be about 1.32 nm (370 GHz) between peaks.
<p>
<li>An etalon is a weak Fabry-Perot resonator placed at a very slight
 angle (to eliminate reflections back into the cavity and thus multicavity
 effects) that superimposes its  longitudinal modes on the modes of the
 overall cavity.  The mode spacing of a Fabry-Perot etalon (or cavity) is
 given by:
<p>
<PRE>
                        lambda<sup>2</sup>
       delta_lambda = -----------
                       2 * n * l
</PRE>
<p>
Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>lambda is the free-space wavelength of the fundamental intracavity beam.
 <li>l is the length of the etalon.
 <li>n is the effective index of refraction of the etalon material.
 </ul>
<p>
For the C315M KTP crystal (l = 5 mm, n = 1.6) at 1,064 nm, this works out
to be about 0.07 nm (20 GHz) between peaks.
</ul>
<p>
Note that the equations for the birefringent filter and etalon are nearly
identical but since one for birefringence depends on the much smaller
delta_n rather than just n in the denominator, it will have a much larger
mode spacing.
<p>
Based on the mode spacing from the equations above, the birefringent filter
would appear to be clearly superior for mode selection and single mode
operation as long as its loss function with respect to the polarization
preference of the Brewster plate is large enough.  While many etalon modes
can exist within the YAG gain bandwidth of about 0.5 nm (140 Ghz), only a
single birefringent filter mode will fit.  However, the birefringent filter
response being so broad would mean that adjacent cavity modes see almost the
same gain at its peak which is probably not adequate for reliable mode
selection.
<p>
A research paper that discusses a similar type of laser (though one using
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> rather than Nd:YAG is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>G. J. Friel, A. J. Kemp, K. Lake, B. D. Sinclair, "Compact and efficient
 Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> laser that generates a tunable single frequency green
 output", Applied Optics, vol. 39, no. 24, Aug. 20, 2000.
</ul>
<p>
Ignoring the tunable part, the cavity design described in this paper is very
close to that of the C315M and even closer to the C415M since that laser
uses Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> as the gain medium.
<p>
The paper is also where some of the values and equations were obtained.  Based
on information in the paper (which is somewhat more involved than would be
worthwhile to reproduce here) but adapted for the C315M cavity configuration,
the temperature change needed to tune the birefringent filter through one
complete period (2*pi) would be about 20 &deg;C so this in fact may be
the broad response curve that is evident when adjusting KTP temperature.
The temperature change needed to tune between adjacent modes is about
0.14 &deg;C, which is fairly close to the 0.10 &deg;C that was estimated
experimentally.
<p>
I still have this sneaking suspicion that there is a third element used
in mode selection that has not been identified yet.  This is because while
the response of temperature tuning the KTP is periodic along with the
broad maximum, the peaks of the ripples are not the same or smoothly
increasing or decreasing in amplitude as they are with the C532 laser.
Rather, the response is irregular and lumpy with small peaks interspersed
between occasional large ones.  Furthermore, the birefringent filter loss
function doesn't seem to be narrow enough to select out a single longitudinal
mode since the polarization selection of just a Brewster angle plate is
not nearly as strong as with Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> as described in the paper
(and used in the C415M).  There would appear to be some additional mode
selection mechanism which may still be an etalon using the KTP or possibly
the surfaces of the YAG rod.
<p>
Although I haven't gone through the equations in detail, it may just be the
KTP is also acting as an etalon.  For its mode spacing of 0.07 nm,
the temperature change for a complete period would appear to be in the
range of 0.7 to 1.0 &deg;C.  If this were combined
with the ripples of the cavity modes, the result might just be the
lumpy function in question. :)  Think of it this way: There is the YAG
gain curve, birefringent filter response, etalon peaks, and cavity
mode peaks.  To get maximum efficiency, a maxima of all of these have to
line up and it's not really possible to move any one function totally
independently of the others.
<p>
Although the YAG rod has a longer optical length (and thus more closely
spaced modes), its behavior as an etalon would be generally similar, though
controlled by the cavity temperature rather than KTP temperature.
<p>
One of these feels about right and although I think it's the KTP because
the etalon peaks would be further apart but I'm not totally sure.  Stay
tuned. :)
<p>
Note that the SHG process in itself tends to favor single mode operation
due to the non-linear process.  So, a laser that operates multimode without
the KTP may in fact be much more likely to run single mode with it installed
and aligned for proper phase matching.
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
Non-linear doubling increases single-frequency operation.
It has something to do with the fact that a weak mode which
wants to compete with the lasing mode experiences a higher loss than
the lasing mode due to sum-frequency-mixing with the laser mode.
<p>
Here is the full story:
<p>
K. I. Martin, W. A. Clarkson, and D. C. Hanna, "Self-suppression of axial
mode-hopping by intracavity second-harmonic generation", Optics Letters,
vol. 22, no. 6, pp 375-377, March 1997.
<p>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b>
<p>
Intracavity second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a single-frequency
laser has an associated loss for adjacent nonlasing modes, from
sum-frequency generation, that is greater than the loss from SHG for
the lasing mode. mode-hopping is thereby suppressed, as the lasing
mode dominates neighboring modes. We have investigated this behavior
in a Nd:YAG laser with LBO intracavity frequency doubler, obtaining
frequency tuning over more than 80 axial mode spacings, without mode
hopping.

The following section deals specifically with the C415M laser head internals.

<h4><A NAME="sclc415h">C415M Laser Head Optical Layout</A></h4>

The general organization of the C415M is similar to the C315M head but it
is considerably larger.  The one fundamental difference is that the C415M
uses Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate) rather than YAG as the laser medium.
Photos can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.94 or

<p>
The following are brief descriptions of each of the labeled parts in the
last photo which is also included here as
<A HREF="c415cav1.jpg">C415M Cavity Components and Output Optics</A>.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pump diode with Collimating Lens:</b> This is very similar to the one
 used in the C315M except that instead of a single GRIN lens for beam shaping,
 this has a normal glass lens.  I assume it is just a bare laser diode chip
 on something like a C-Block inside as with the C315M.  A 100 ohm resistor is
 soldered across the external pins to provide some ESD protection.  The diode
 is higher power than the one in the C315M with a typical maximum current
 of 3.5 A.
<p>
 The threshold, operating, and maximum current for the laser diode when new
 are scribed on the top of the laser diode case.  For example, a typical set
 of numbers might be: 1.08 2.78 3.53.  (The order of these values may not be
 the same in all instances.)  I assume these are in amps for the specific
 laser head at its optimal temperature settings.  In the example, 1.08 would be
 the lowest current for any green output; 2.78 would be the current at the
 head's rated output power, and 3.53 would be the maximum safe current for
 the diode (and probably the current limit setting on the head PCB).
<p>
<li><b>Pump beam shaping optics:</b> A plano-convex cylindrical lens,
 biconvex spherical lens, and another plano-convex cylindrical are used
 rather than the more conventional anamorphic prisms and focusing lens.
<p>
<li><b>Green Filter:</b> This is a thin piece of red material which absorbs
 any green light returning to the pump diode.
<p>
<li><b>HR Mirror:</b> Concave high reflector cavity mirror.
<p>
<li><b>Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> Assembly:</b> The vanadate is mounted in a metal
 heatsink.  The actual crystal is about 3x3x4mm (WxHxL), coated AR/AR.
 I believe this is vanadate based on its color and that it is square rather
 than round. :)
<p>
<li><b>Stop 1:</b> Intracavity aperture plate.
<p>
<li><b>Brewster Plate Assembly:</b> A horizontally angled plate is mounted
 in a metal frame and is not visible in the photo.  I'm not sure why a
 Brewster plate is needed with a vanadate laser but perhaps it further
 enhances the orientation dependent cavity loss for added stability.
<p>
<li><b>Blue LED????:</b>  This really is a common *blue* LED but what effect
 would it have on the KTP?  And, it's installed in a socket and obviously
 not aimed with any precision.  So, perhaps it's just there for use during
 manufacturing, perhaps as an aid in alignment.  Otherwise, why put it in a
 socket <i>inside</i> a sealed enclosure?  The in-circuit behavior using a
 DMM was also strange on the diode test function - the voltage started out at
 about 1.5 V and gradually <i>decreased</i>, not constant as would be expected
 with a diode or resistor, and opposite of what would be expected across a
 capacitor.  Out of circuit, it behaved like a blue LED with a voltage drop
 of about 2.8 V at 1 mA and was quite bright even at this low current.
 Maybe it's there to tease anyone foolish enough to go inside the C415M
 laser head. :)
<p>
<li><b>KTP on TEC:</b> A 2x2x5mm (WxHxL) KTP crystal is attached to a TEC.
<p>
<li><b>OC Mirror:</b> This is the output coupler mirror for the laser cavity.
<p>
<li><b>Turning Mirror 1:</b> This right angle prism is coated to reflect
 green (532 nm) and pass IR.  I assume that the only reason it's a prism
 shape and not a simple mirror is convenience in mounting.
<p>
<li><b>Beam Sampler:</b> A thick optical plate that reflects a portion of the
 output beam (green I assume) into the photosensors.  Maybe.
<p>
<li><b>Photosensors:</b> At least that's what this assembly appears to be,
 a pair of sensors that line up with the reflection from the beam sampler,

<h3><A NAME="sclc532i">C532 User Interface Signals</A></h3>

The following chart lists the signals on the external HD15 pin interface
connector of the C532-200/100.  There may be some differences for lower
power versions.  The C532-400 is similar, though the manual doesn't
mention the LD and KTP Temp signals - just says "Factory Use".
<p>
The most important signals for confirming proper controller
operation are LDI, and LD and KTP Temp.  If these values agree with those
printed on the cavity sticker but output is low or non-existent, the problem
is likely with the pump diode, crystals, or optics inside the cavity.

<h3><A NAME="sclc532c">Details of the C532 Laser Cavity</A></h3>

A photo of the interior of the C532-200 cavity can be seen in
<A HREF="c532cav1.jpg">Interior of Coherent Compass 532-200 Laser Cavity</A>.
Since this is a small ring (rather than linear or Fabry-Perot) cavity
laser, the arrangement and functions of the crystals and optics may not
be immediately obvious.  There are a few photos at
<A HREF="http://www.junktronix.com/gallery/c532">Junktronix.com Laser Gallery -
Coherent Compass 532 Laser</A> as well.
<p>
Also see <b>U.S. Patent #5052815: Single Frequency Ring Laser With Two
Reflecting Surfaces</b>.  This appears to be one of the principle patents
covering the Coherent 532 laser.
<p>
Here is a brief description of each component:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pump diode: An SDL-2372 rated approximately 2.2 W max at 808 nm.  It
 is typically running at less than 50% of its rating in this laser (when new).
<p>
 I dissected a dead SDL-2372 by filing around the edges and drilling a hole
 in one corner of the top so I could use a screwdriver as a lever to pry
 the top off.  The laser diode itself is on a standard
 C-mount screwed to a large gold plated copper block along with the
 temperature sensor thermistor and monitor photodiode.  The block is
 soldered to a TEC which almost fills the bottom of the case.  On the
 dead one, the solder had come apart and the block also came loose from
 the terminal pins.  I don't know if that was all due to
 mechanical shock, poor manufacturing, or the TEC being overdriven in
 the heating direction.  I reassembled it with silver Epoxy instead of
 solder and it still works, though the slope efficiency is near the low
 end of the acceptable range listed in the specifications.  So, it may
 be normal or a sign of prior damage.  There is no obvious problem with
 the beam profile so it's possible that nothing is wrong.
<p>
<li>Collimator: This is glued to the laser diode and consists of a single very
 small lens mounted in an inside barrel, which can be moved within an outside
 barrel.  Both are fixed with spots of glue once the optimal position and
 orientation are determined.  Interchangeability of the diode package with
 collimator attached is definitely not guaranteed, though some
 units may be close enough to swap diodes without readjusting these optics.
 In one laser that I repaired, it was possible to obtain 150 mW at rated
 diode current after slightly elongating the holes in the replacement
 diode package taken from a certifiably dead C532 cavity.  However, the beam
 is more elliptical than is typical and I  expect that with a full collimator
 realignment, it would meet or exceed new specs.  On another laser, the
 collimated diode beam was so far off that it didn't even pass through
 the beam shaping optics.  On that unit, the collimater had to be totally
 realigned.
<p>
<li>op1: Primary lens for the pump beam shaping optics.  The output of op1
 is approximately collimated.
<p>
<li>op2: Anamorphic prisms to circularize the beam.
<p>
<li>op3: Cylindrical lens to correct astigmatism.
<p>
<li>op4: The right half is a lens to focus the beam into the vanadate.  The
 left half is the HT@808nm,HR@1064nm mirror which is the right-most limit of
 the laser cavity.
<p>
<li>cry1: The YAG crystal which is approximately 1.5x3x10mm AR coated for
 808 and 1064 nm.  It appears to be cut at the Brewster angle on the hidden
 end to provide the linearly polarized intracavity beam and also to divert
 the beam path for the ring geometry (rather than using an additional mirror).
 A powerful magnet with its field lines parallel to the YAG crystal is used
 to rotate the polarization by a small angle using the Faraday effect.  This
 in conjunction with op5 (below), enforces that only the clockwise traveling
 wave propagates inside the cavity.
<p>
<li>cry2: The KTP doubling crystal which is approximately 1x1x5mm also AR
 coated for 1064 nm on both ends, and 532 nm on the output end.  It is
 mounted on a small TEC to precisely control its temperature.  There are
 electrodes deposited top and bottom to exploit its piezoelectric sensitivity
 to implement precise cavity length control for mode stabilization.
<p>
<li>op5: A waveplate (thickness about 100 um, probably 1/2 lambda, maybe
 made of quartz) which works in conjunction with the Faraday rotator and
 possibly the birefringence of the KTP to favor the clockwise traveling beam
 and suppress the counterclockwise traveling beam.  A 1/2 lambda waveplate
 could be oriented during manufacture to rotate the polarization by exactly
 the correct amount (probably only a few degrees) to precisely compensate for
 the effects of the Faraday rotator.   Testing a piece of this plate between
 cross polarizers, this optic is definitely birefringent with high
 transmission (possibly 100 percent) at multiples of 90 degree orientations.
 By being installed at the Brewster angle (as it appears to be), reflections
 from its surfaces are minimized and this acts to reinforce the polarization
 preference of the Brewster-cut YAG crystal.  (Since there is a polarization
 rotation produced by the birefringence, both surfaces of op5 can't
 simultaneously be the proper Brewster angle but the error is probably
 quite small.)  Without this optic in place, the C532 output beam is weak
 and split into several sub-beams (multi-transverse mode).  Part of this
 is due to the shift in intracavity alignment that results without the
 refraction through the plate.  I've heard that simply using a high quality
 microscope cover slip as a replacement results in a significant improvement
 in power output as this restores beam alignment inside the resonator.
 However, without introducing the polarization rotation of the waveplate, the
 laser won't be unidirectional so at the very least, stability will be poor and
 single mode operation with its impressive 150 meter coherence length won't
 be achieved.
<p>
<li>op6: Second mirror of laser cavity.  HR@1064nm,HT@532nm, concave.  Also
 forms primary optic (expander) of output telescope.
<p>
<li>op7: Secondary optic (collimator) of output telescope.
<p>
<li>op8: IR blocking filter/waveplate.  This optic is a bit strange in being
 composed of two pieces optically contacted or glued together.  One is
 the IR (blocking) filter, being blue-ish in color.  This 10x10 mm plate
 also seals the end of the laser head.  The other piece is a block of
 clear material about 4x4 mm across and 6 mm and may is a waveplate to
 rotate the polarization of the output green beam (which would exit the
 KTP at a close to a 45 degree angle offset by the Faraday rotation angle)
 back to vertical.  It has an arrow on top for orientation purposes.
</ul>
<p>
Although a bit hard to make out in the photo, the intracavity beam path
is: cry1 (YAG), then reflect off of the left surface of op4 (HR mirror),
through cry2 (KTP), then reflect off of the right surface of op6 (OC mirror),
through op5 (angled plate), and finally back through cry1.
<p>
I just replaced the aluminum cover on the cavity of a C532 with one made of
Plaxiglas so I could watch the photons doing their thing. :)  It's really
amazing when the unidirectional nature of the beam in the ring is clearly
visible.  There is almost no green light at one end of the KTP crystal and
a really bright spot at the other end.  The beam then hits the OC (another
bright spot) and exits the laser.  Unlike the typical Fabry-Perot (linear
cavity) laser where everything lights up green from the backward-traveling
beam, with the ring cavity, most of the green is present in a very limited
area between the KTP crystal and OC mirror (and then the exit optics).
<p>
The primary difference between teh C532-200 and C532-400 is in the pump
diode and its beam shaping.  The C532-400 uses an SDL-2382 4 watt diode.
It's in exactly the same package but has double the output power,
double the stripe width, and approximately double the maximum drive
current.  For all these reasons, it really isn't possible to drop
the higher power diode into a C532-200 laser and expect anything useful.
<p>
Photos of the interior of a C532-400 can be seen in
<A HREF="c532cav2.jpg">Interior of Coherent Compass 532-400 Laser Cavity</A>
and <A HREF="c532cav4.jpg">Interior of Coherent Compass 532-400 Laser
Cavity Powered Up</A>.  The only thing missing here is the final collimating
lens, which had fallen off. :( :)  Note that over half the length of
the cavity is devoted to the pump diode and it's beam shaping optics.
There is focusing in both the slow and fast axes.  This may have been
a prototype so I don't know if this complexity is present in production
C532-400s.

<h3><A NAME="sclc532e">C532 Electronics</A></h3>

Most circuitry for the C532 is contained on one large controller PCB
(See <A HREF="c532pcbt.jpg">C532-200 Controller PCB Top View</A> for
the high power version.).  This connects to the interior of the laser
cavity via a pair of cables, one for the laser diode and the other for
everything else.  The lower power versions of the C532 use a more compact
controller with most of the same functionality and even many of the
same test points, part numbers, and most part values.  However, there are
some subtle differences needed to be optimal for lower power versions.
The functions of two or three signals to the outside world also differ
based on specific model and whether for the end user or OEM.

<h4><A NAME="sclc532p">C532 Power Input Module</A></h4>

For end-user versions of the C532 in the cool black case, there is an
input fuse/voltage selector/line filter, followed by an AC input module on
a small PCB.  The AC line is either doubled (115 VAC) or bridge rectified
(230 VAC) depending on voltage selection, and then filtered to produce +300
VDC.  This is followed by a DC-DC converter (mounted under the PCB)
which generates either 12 VDC (higher power models including the 532-100 and
532-200) or 5 to 5.5 VDC (possibly for lower power models).  The only other
active circuitry on the AC input module is circuitry to provide a source of
low current +5 VDC for the cooling fan(s) and external equipment, and 1 or 3
power LEDs.  However, all signals to the J4 User Interface connector pass
through this PCB.  OEM C532s lack the AC input module.

<h4><A NAME="sclc532l">C532 LD and TEC Drivers</A></h4>

Most of the electronics is on the C532 Controller PCB which includes
additional DC-DC converters for +5 VDC (if not already present), -5 VDC,
and some other references; drivers for the laser diode (LD), drivers for
the LD and KTP Thermo-Elctric Coolers (TECs); and mode stabilization circuitry.
<p>
The laser diode driver is a series pass linear constant current regulator
with a laser diode max current (set by the LDIM pot) which may be reduced
by the light loop feedback signal (set by PHOTO pot) when the laser is
operating in constant power mode.
<p>
The LD driver is only enabled after a 15 to 20 second delay from power-on
(LD_OFF LED goes off).  Any fault condition (including breaking the interlock
connection) will cause it to be immediately disabled (LD_OFF LED goes on).
Power cycling is required to restore operation for an interlock fault (once
the fault is cleared).  A power dip may result in a reset and power-on delay.
<p>
The laser diode's temperature is regulated by a TE Cooler (TEC) located inside
the LD package.  It uses a series PWM driver using feedback from an NTC
thermistor also inside the LD package.  The setpoint is adjusted by the
LD TMP pot.
<p>
The KTP crystal's temperature is regulated by a TEC on which it is mounted.
A linear driver using a power op-amp (L272) using feedback from both an NTC
thermistor located on the KTP mount, as well as from the mode stabilization
circuit described in the next section.

<h4><A NAME="sclc532m">C532 Mode Stabilization</A></h4>

In order to obtain its incredible 150 meter coherence length, the C532 uses
a ring cavity configuration which assures single mode operation but also
includes circuitry to optimize the KTP temperature based on optical feedback
to center the lasing mode within the YAG gain curve.  As best as I can
determine so far, here is how the cavity is fine tuned by the C532 controller.
<p>
The heart of the stabilization control loop is an SE5521 LVDT Signal
Conditioner IC (a Google search will return links to the SE5521 datasheet
and app notes).  An LVDT is a position transducer.  It takes a really clever
design engineer to use an LVDT controller in a laser! :)  Among other
things, the SE5521 includes a sinewave oscillator and synchronous demodulator.
<p>
The KTP crystal has electrodes on its top and bottom faces which are fed by an
AC signal (about 10 kHz from the SE5521 oscillator) called "dither".  This
causes the KTP to change shape by a small amount.  While notations on the
schematics suggest that the EO (Electro-Optic) effect is used, it would be
much too small to cause any detectable change with the low level (a few
V p-p) drive signal.  Thus, what is almost certain is that it is really
the piezo-electric effect by which this takes place.  Perhaps they intend
"EO" to stand for something else.  In any case, the result is to cause the
effective length of the KTP to change in synchronism with the dither signal.
It doesn't change by much but the wavelength of light is very small. :)  This
affects the KTP phase matching and any birefringent filter effect,
and cavity mode position relative to the
Nd:YAG gain curve.  With the light control loop active, laser diode current
also varies to maintain constant output power as the gain changes due to the
dither signal.
<p>
The AC component of the laser diode current is amplified, clipped, and applied
along with the oscillator signal (as a reference) to the SE5521's synchronous
demodulator.  Its output will have a symmetric AC component and zero relative
DC offset when the peak power (lowest laser diode current) is centered within
the excursion caused by the dither signal.  Both conditions are used to modify
the KTP temperature ever so slightly to maintain this condition, which should
also maximize laser output and stability.  Although the effective cavity
length, and the KTP phase matching and birefringent filter response are both
affected by temperature
changes, the latter change much more slowly - there are many local maxima
where the cavity mode is centered within the Nd:YAG gain curve and those
are still close to optimal.  Maintaining one of these modes
centered on the Nd:YAG gain curve is the function of the mode stabilization
control loop.  If the default KTP temperature is set for maximum output
with the control loop disabled and then it is enabled,
the resulting efficiency (i.e., minimizing pump diode current when running in
light mode) will be close to optimal.  Even if the initial KTP temperature
is a bit off, the cavity mode will still be very well centered by the control
loop but the efficiency will be slightly lower.  However, note that unlike
some stabilized HeNe (and other) lasers where the operating frequency is
spec'd to 27 decimal places, the exact operating frequency of the C532 can't
be predicted, but it will probably remain nearly the same over time and
from one power cycle to the next (after warmup) as long as the temperature
of the laser and thus the Nd:YAG crystal is constant which puts the peak of
the gain curve in the same place.  Since the cavity temperature is NOT
something that is controlled for the C532 - only the pump diode and KTP -
for best stability, a temperature controlled baseplate or enclosure would
be desirable.  I've heard that over hours, a typical C532 will drift
slightly and even mode hop occasionally, almost certainly due to the
unregulated baseplate temperature resulting the limited range of the
mode stabilization circuitry to keep the mode centered.
<p>
While the description above only deals with the cavity modes, the natural
birefringence of the KTP also likely plays a role in determining the locations
of the peaks in the response by implementing a birefringent filter, it
produces a loss function with a broad peak which may be superimposed on the
KTP phase matching response or may indeed be the dominant cause of the
broad response.
<p>
However, there is (I believe) a fundamental design deficiency which may result
in some randomness in which local maximum is actually selected.  The mode
stabilization control loop uses a pure integrator and it becomes active as
soon as the laser diode is turned on (15 to 20 seconds after power is applied)
and although the KTP temperature is probably fairly stable by then, this is
certainly not the case with the overall cavity and of course the laser diode
(which indirectly affects cavity temperature).  As the cavity warms up and
stabilizes, the drift in lasing mode will result in a decreasing temperature
in the KTP as the circuit attempts to remain locked.  This offset may in the
lasing mode ending up a considerable distance away from the best phase
matching location if the default KTP temperature was set for optimum
performance when warmed up.  So, the lasing efficiency may suffer.
Furthermore, if the laser is turned off and on again without cooling
completely, conditions will be quite different than at cold start and
a randomly different peak will be selected.  There is no way to assure
that both of these will be similar.  The randomness
is probably only a few percent but I would have expected better.
<p>
The design solution would be to keep the integrator zeroed until the laser has
reached thermal equilibrium.  But then, Coherent wouldn't be able to claim
the 5 minute warmup time! :)  A work-around that would compensate for the
offest, though not the randomness, would be to preadjust the KTP default
temperature to be slightly higher than optimal so that it would stabilize
at around the correct temperature.
<p>
Note that the >150 meter coherence length of the C532 is actually much
<i>better</i> (at least 3 times, possibly 10 times or more) than for the
much higher power and very expensive (around $58,000) Coherent Verdi.
<p>
The good news is that this system, despite possibly appearing to be pure
magic, seems to work very well with no critical adjustments.

<h3><A NAME="sclc532t">Powering the C532 Laser Head with a Third-Party or
 Home-Built Controller</A></h3>

Unlike the C315M, the C532 almost always comes with a controller.  Even the
OEM version only lacks a 12 VDC power supply but is otherwise complete.
And, manually adjusting the LD current, and LD and KTP temperatures is
very easy via multiturn pots on the controller mainboard.
Thus, unless the existing controller has suffered a complete meltdown,
it is probably worth repairing since documentation is available and no
expensive or impossible to obtain custom parts are used.  Furthermore,
the Coherent controller will include the mode stabilization
circuitry - something that would be more difficult to replicate.  The
following assumes that the laser head is known to be in good operating
condition with a healthy pump diode and decent alignment.
<p>
Driving the C532 laser head will require a laser diode driver and two TEC
controllers.  However, since all components are electrically isolated,
there should be no problems in using a lab-style controller like the ILX
Lightwave LDC-3900, modules such as those from Wavelength Electronics, or
a cobbled together collection of power supplies (though I don't recommend
the latter due to their lack of feedback control).
<p>
What's needed is the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser diode driver:</b> Constant current adjustable up to the maximum
 current rating of the pump diode, typically 3 to 4 A.
 The photodiode output of the C532 can be used to control optical
 power after everything else is stable.  Just make sure the current
 limit is set to a value safe for the pump diode!
<p>
<p>
<li><b>LD TEC:</b> I'm not sure of the exact requirements but 2 A will
 probably be adequate.  The temperature sensor is a 10K NTC thermistor.
<p>
<li><b>KTP TEC:</b> I'm not sure of the exact requirements but 100 mA
 will probably be adequate.  DO NOT exceed this current by very much
 as the TEC can melt - not a good thing!  The temperature sensor is a
 10K NTC thermistor.
</ul>
<p>
With a lab-style controller, the diode current and temperatures
will be available on the front panel.  Otherwise, you'll have to provide
some means of monitoring them.  The <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc532a">C532
Control Panel and Test Adapter</A> can be adapted by adding
circuitry to provide what is normally part of the Coherent C532 controller.
Multiple meters can also be used but is much less convenient.
<p>
Power up the diode at about 1.5 A cooled to around 15 &deg;C.  Make sure
there is adequate airflow over the head heatsink!  The typical
threshold is under 1 A when everything else is optimal.  If there is green
light, the rest is trivial.  Slowly adjust the LD TEC for maximum output.
Its response is quite slow - allow 30 seconds to a minute for the temperature
to stabilize after small adjustments.  Once the best temperature for the LD
TEC has been found, do the same for the KTP TEC.  The KTP temperature changes
very rapidly - a second or so for a small change.  The response of the
laser output is a broad peak with small ripples.  The optimal temperature
is where the broad peak and a ripple are maximum.  Now, increase pump
diode current to produce the desired level of light output.  The LD
temperature will need to be adjusted somewhat to again maximize output.
The KTP temperature will also need to be adjusted, but much less so.
<p>
If there is no green light at 1.5 A, perform a manual search by changing
the pump diode temperature in 5 &deg;C increments over the range: 5 &deg;C
to 30 &deg;C, and then for each, vary KTP temperature over the range 15 &deg;C
to 40 &deg;C.  If still no output, the pump diode collimator may be out of
alignment (likely only if the diode was replaced) or the pump diode or some
other cavity component may be damaged.
<p>
Output power will fluctuate as the cavity heats up and expands.  Without
mode stabilization, there is no way around this except to temperature
stabilize the baseplate and wait long enough for the system to come to
thermal equilibrium.

<h3><A NAME="sclc532b">Blue Version of the C532?</A></h3>

As far as I know, this doesn't exist, though I would expect that
design similar to the C532 should be possible.  Nd:YAG has a lasing
line at 946 which can be doubled to 473.  KTP can't be used but I
think BBO can.  Of course, the gain at the 946 line is much lower
and temperature control will be more critical but it should be possible.
<p>
Aligning a ring cavity could be a pain though!

<h2>Coherent Verdi Green High Power DPSS Laser</h2>

The Verdi is probably the best commercial single frequency high power 532 nm
available today (2006) with models up to at least 18 W of CW output power.
Information may be found at <A HREF="http://www.cohr.com/">Coherent, Inc.</A>.
Go to "Product", "Lasers", "Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers", "CW DPSS Lasers",
then to "Verdi - DPSS CW Pump Lasers".
<p>
Like the also very high quality but lower power C532, the Verdi is based on
a unidirectional ring cavity configuration.  The ring virtually guarantees
low noise single frequency operation.  The actual Verdi cavity is dual
fiber pumped and has a "bow tie" or "figure of eight" geometry as shown in
<A HREF="verdi1.gif">Ring Cavity Resonator of Coherent, Inc. Verdi Green
DPSS Laser</A>.  Each fiber can provide 20 or more watts of 808 nm pump
power (depending on the Verdi output power rating).  A photo of the inside
of an actual Verdi can be found at <A HREF="verdicv1.jpg">Coherent Verdi
DPSS Laser Cavity with Components Labeled</A>.
<p>
Here are descriptions of the various parts.  For the optical paths, brown
lines are 808 nm pump light, red lines are fundamental 1,064 nm, yellow
lines are 1064 nm + SHG 532 nm, and green lines are the 532 nm output.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Diode/Fiber Input:</b> These are probably multicore fibers (19 typical)
 fed from a 1 cm long fast-axis corrected diode bar.  The "diode pack" is
 located in the power supply box which is remote from the Verdi laser head.
<p>
<li><b>Pump Turning Prism:</b> This just flips the optical path for one
 of the fibers to make routing more convenient.
<p>
<li><b>Pump Optics:</b> Each fiber feeds a set of lenses that focus the
 output from the fiber core into the Nd:YVO4 crystal with the desired
 beam waist <i>through</i> the two mirrors which form the top extent of
 the bow tie cavity.
<p>
<li><b>Nd:YVO4 Crystal:</b> The size order of 5x5x12 mm sandwiched within
 a copper heatsink probably with indium foil.  There is a TE cooler
 under the heatsink.
<p>
<li><b>Mirrors 1 and 2:</b> The top mirrors of the bow tie cavity are
 HT@808nm, HR@1064nm.  The left mirror (1) is probably curved so that
 in conjunction with the bottom right mirror, produces a beam waist
 inside the LBO.
<p>
<li><b>Astigmatic Compensator:</b> This is probably an AR-coated plate
 that removes the astigmatism introduced by the folded cavity configuration
 to produce a circular beam.
<p>
<li><b>SHG LBO:</b> The Verdi uses LBO rather than KTP for the frequency
 doubler.  The LBO is mounted in an over and must be maintained at around
 150 &deg;C for optimum phase matching.  Controlled warmup and cool-down are
 critical to avoid cracking.  There is even a backup battery to assure this
 on cool-down should AC power be lost.
<p>
<li><b>Isolator:</b> This is the "Optical Diode" to favor the clockwise
 direction of light travel in the ring.
<p>
<li><b>Etalon:</b> Although the ring configuration guarantees single
 frequency operation, it doesn't stabilize the lasing line to a specific
 location on the Nd:YVO4 gain curve.  That is probably the function of
 the etalon, which is temperature controlled.
<p>
<li><b>Power Monitor:</b> This photodiode is used to control the output
 power via feedback to pump current.

<h2>JDS Uniphase SLM uGreen 532 nm DPSS Laser</h2>
<h3><A NAME="scljuugd">General Description of the uGreen Laser</A></h3>

This is a compact and cute DPSS laser head along with a controller
with models rated from 10 to 50 mW maximum output power.  The laser is
supposed to operate in a Single Longitudinal Mode (SLM, or single frequency).
While this exact laser doesn't appear to be a current product, similar
models can be found on the <A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A>
Web site.  Go to "Products", "Commercial Lasers", "Solid State Lasers".
<p>
Note: Although the CDRH sticker on uGreen lasers usually says "125 mW max" even
for a 10 mW laser, we all know what that means - absolutely nothing.  It's
just a safety rating, not an actual output power rating.  These lasers are
not designed to run at more than 50 mW, though it's likely that the 10 mW
and 50 mW lasers of the same model series are actually the same, except
possibly for the pump diode.  So, anyone listing these on eBay as 125 mW
lasers should be politely informed of the facts. :)  Having said that,
I have seen around 100 mW from a particularly "hot" sample of a uGreen
4601-050-1000 when driven close to the diode current limit.  This may be
relatively safe for a laser using discrete crystals and optics.  However,
I wouldn't recommend pushing your luck with uGreen lasers using a
composite crystal like the 4301 (and 4501) as they may have a relatively low
destruction threshold.
<p>
(There are also Uniphase uBlue lasers but I have no idea if they are in any
way similar to the uGreens in their construction details.)
<p>
The first laser head I tested was a 4601-010-1000, possibly an OEM model
for the graphic arts industry.  The second number in
the model is the rated power - 10 mW in this case.  The controller is a
model HYB B 2.3, an older style.  It runs off 5 VDC and required up to 5 A
during warmup, settling back down to about 2 to 3 A after stabilizing.
(Higher power models will likely require greater power supply current and
a 10 A power supply is recommended.)  The laser is manufactured in the UK.
<p>
Most of the uGreen lasers including the 46XX/47XX models use diode pumped
vanadate-KTP-OC mirror Fabry-Perot
cavities and their design appears conventional in all respects except one:
The vanadate is ground with significant wedge and also mounted at an angle
so that the the intracavity beam (which is aligned with the axis of the
laser) is deflected slightly at its surface.  The angle isn't anywhere near
the Brewster angle for a vanadate-to-air interface.  The purpose is most
likely to eliminate any reflections from the surface (even though it is
also AR coated).   The polarization preference of the vanadate along with the
birefringent filter effect provided by the KTP is likely sufficient to
maintain single mode operation for the modest range of power over which the
uGreen laser operates (10 to 50 mW).  This is confirmed by the behavior of
the laser with respect to temperature adjustment of the laser cavity.
<p>
There is more information on maintenance and repair of this laser starting
with the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strjuugt">Troubleshooting of the
uGreen DPSS Laser</A>.
<p>
CAUTION: Some, probably older, uGreen laser use an optically contacted
composite crystal, also known as a Multiple Crystal Assembly (MCA) rather
than discrete crystals and optics.  Two such models are the 4301 and 4501.
These may have a power limit not that far above the rating of the laser head.
I've seen at least one case where the MCA was apparently damaged when the
HYB B switched from constant current to constant light mode with the feedback
gain set too low so the current went much higher than required for the
rated power.  After disassembling the laser head and slightly repositioning
the MCA, normal operation was restored.  I couldn't see any damage to
the MCA but this is the only explanation that makes sense.  Therefore,
I would not recommend attempting to run 4301/4501 and similar lasers too far
above their rated power.  15 mW, maybe even 20 mW for a -10 is probably safe
(this one was running slightly above 20 mW without incident) but much above
20 mW may be asking for trouble for both the -10 and -20.  At least, there
is a fair amount of range for repositioning the MCA! :)  Also note that the
4301 and 4501 have a much higher slope efficiency compared to the discrete
optics lasers and thus usually runs at a much lower current for the same output
power.  So, start low to be safe.
<p>
CAUTION: Each uGreen laser head and HYB B controller are a matched pair
(though the serial numbers will probably be different).
Despite the presence of a serial EEPROM in the laser head, it is not read by
the HYB B controller (but may be read by newer controllers).  The laser diode
and TEC parameters are determined by pot settings in the controller
and must be set up for each laser head.  Thus,
unlike the Coherent Compass M lasers where the head personality is contained
on a PCB attached to the head and any head can be plugged into any
compatible controller without setup, a random uGreen laser head and HYB B
can't be connected with the expectation of getting anything useful.  At
the very least, the output power won't be correct, LD and RES temperatures
will be incorrect resulting in poor efficiency, and stability will
suffer.  Worse, damage to the head may result if the diode current limit
is set too high for the particular head.  It will be necessary to go through
the adjustment procedure described in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#scljuugu">Using the HYBRID
B Controller for Testing of uGreen Lasers</A>.  Label each head and mating
controller so you know which go together, especially if you have multiple
systems and may detach the heads at some point.

<h3><A NAME="scljuugco">uGreen Connections</A></h3>
<h4><A NAME="scljuugw1">uGreen Controller to 4601 Laser Head Wiring</A></h4>

The following applies to the Hybrid B controller with the model 4601 laser
head.  Some other versions of the 4600 and 4700 series with the HD15 connector
may be similar but I don't know for sure.  The 4601, 4611, and 4711 appear
to have identical wiring.  The 4712 is identical except for an active circuit
associated with the photodiode (which means it may not work with the
HYB B without modifications).  But the 4617 which uses the same HD15
connector, has totally different internal wiring and additional circuitry
which may possibly be similar to what's in the 4712.
<p>
The laser head and controller are attached via a cable with a DB25 at the
controller and an HD15 at the laser head.  There are "Warranty Void" stickers
on the connectors at both ends so I guess I voided the warranty by
disconnecting the cable to determine this wiring.  Darn. :)

Note: Pins 2 and 3 of the laser head HD15 go through the cable but are not
connected to the DB25 at the Hybrid B controller.  They interface to the
24C32A serial EEPROM on the flex PCB inside the laser head, which is ignored
by the Hybrid B controller.  However, if another controller is used, they may
be needed.  (SCL and SDA have a 4.7K ohm pullup resistor to Vcc.  Pins 1 and
6 of the laser head HD15 are Vcc and GND, respectively.  A0, A1, A2, and WP
are tied to ground.)
<p>
There is an NAIS V414S opto-isolated
MOS relay (closed with no power) that appears
be a feeble attempt to protect the laser diode when the laser is off (e.g.,
the head cable is removed).  It can't handle normal laser diode current but
would provide some protection from ESD.

<h4><A NAME="scljuugw2">uGreen Controller to 4301 Laser Head Wiring</A></h4>

The following also applies to the 4501 and possibly other models.
<p>
CAUTION: This DB15 pinout is very different for the 4301/4501 compared to the
4601.  Damage to the laser head and/or controller may result if a HYB B
cable wired for a 4601 is used with a 4301 laser head or vice-versa.
<p>
The following only applies to the Hybrid B controller with the model 4301
and 4501 laser head.  Other versions of the 4301 series may be similar but I
don't know for sure.  It has been confirmed that the 4301 and 4501 will run on
the HYB B but the monitor photodiode on the 4301 I tested was much more
sensitive than for the 4601 so all other factors being equal, swapping in
a 4301 for a 4601 without adjustment will result in lower final output power.

The laser head and controller are attached via a cable with a DB25 at the
controller and an HD15 at the laser head.  Here are the pinouts:

would not hurt anything.  Then a controller that drives the laser diode and

<p>
The photodiode must go via way of some of the circuitry on the flex-PCB
as there don't appear to be any direct connections.
<p>
The other connections on these laser heads have yet to be determined, but
what's here should allow the laser head to be powered on a home-built
controller or a third party controller like like the ILX Lightwave
LDC 3900.  The only issue might be if there is a solid state shorting
relay for the laser diode, in which case it may be damaged (though based
on experience with the 4601 and similar uGreen laser heads, there is
no damage, but the relay sucks up about 50 mA of diode current).
I have powered both of these laser heads without problems using the
pinouts, above.  The lasing threshold is about 350 mA.  At the optimum
temperature, they produced over 25 mW at 750 and 688 mA, respectively.
<p>
These heads came with a newer style digital controller labeled
"21012386".  A similar controller is known to be compatible with
Type 1 heads but it is not yet known if that controller is also compatible
with Type 2 heads - somehow!  The first controller I acquired simply turned on
the Fault LED regardless of what laser head is plugged into it, or even
with no laser head.  (This has been the same experience of others I know
of who have tried the same model controller.)  However, a second sample
of a similar controller does work as expected, so it's possible that
those others were simply bad.

<h3><A NAME="scljuugctr">Uniphase Standard uGreen Controllers</A></h3>
<h4><A NAME="scljuugo">uGreen HYB B Controller</A></h4>

The HYB B is the older, mostly analog, controller for uGreen lasers.
It does NOT read the laser head EEPROM (if present) so the HYB B and
laser head are a matched pair.  All adjustments are via pots.  The HYB B
can probably be used with any uGreen single-TEC or dual-TEC laser head,
though the wiring will differ as outlined below.
<p>
For this controller, power is 5 VDC at 10 A max (though the unit I tested
never went above 5 A) connected to a 5 pin DIN connector (similar to an
older PC KB connector).  +5 V is on pin 3; Ground is on pins 2 and 4.
<p>
The only other connection required is an interlock jumper between pins 2 and
6 of the DB15 on the controller.
<p>
After a few seconds, a relay will click and the laser should come on at low
power in constant current mode.  There will be power fluctuations as the
temperatures of the laser diode and laser cavity stabilize.  After
a couple of minutes, it switches to light feedback mode at which point the
output increases to the maximum power and is very stable.  The initial
current and final power can be changed via pots inside the HYB B.  The
final output power can also be controlled via the DB15F interface
connector.  See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strjuugh">HYBRID B 2.3
Controller for uGreen Laser</A>.

<h4><A NAME="scljuugdc">uGreen 4802 Digital Controller</A></h4>

I don't think there's an official name for this controller like the
HyB B. :)  It is used with the small uGreen laser heads having a
single TEC like the 4702 and the larger uGreen laser heads
with two TECs like the 4601 (but NOT the 4301 or 4501 since they lack
a personality EEPROM and have different connector wiring).  There are
also some larger heads with only a single TEC with which it is compatible.
Both the single-TEC and dual-TEC controllers are physically
similar hardware-wise, except for an extra small PCB on the single-TEC
version (more below).  The following are two known examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Single-TEC Controller:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Model: 4802-0485.
 <li>Part number: 02-000472TK0485Rev.A.
 <li>uController label: Uniphase V3_1E_X3.
 <li>Firmware version: 3.1EX3 uGreen JR. 08-11-99.
 <li>Compatibility: Controller uses operating parameters stored in
  EEPROM on mezzanine PCB in controller and must be mated to specific
  laser head.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Dual-TEC Controller:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Model: 4802-1001.
 <li>Part number: 02-000472TK1001Rev.A.
 <li>uController label: UNI-72-010-0001 FAFB.
 <li>Firmware version: 3.1C 10-30-98.
 <li>Compatibility: Uses operating parameters stored in EEPROM in laesr head.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Attempting to run a dual-TEC laser head on a single-TEC controller may result
in peculiar and possibly damaging results, such as both TECs being driven at
maximum current.  I didn't wait around to find
out what would happen but it didn't appear to be anything good. :)
Trying a single-TEC laser head on a dual-TEC controller is also not
likely to have a good outcome.  The reason will become clear below.
<p>
This 4802 controller is much smaller and lighter than the HYB B.
There are 2 stacked PCBs inside.  The upper one has the
68HC711 uController chip (socketed PLCC) and user interface connector while
the lower one has the drivers for the LD and TECs, and the laser head
and RS232 connectors.  On the bottom of the lower PCB are 12 power
transistors which use the baseplate as a heatsink (via thermal pads).
While overall operation is supervised by
the uController, there is still a lot of analog circuitry.
But there are only two pots and they are on the
upper PCB.  R168 is for calibration of the monitor photodiode in the laser head
and affects both the power output with respect to digital value (in the
SLP command, below) as well as the analog power control input.  Clockwise
decreases the output power (increases PD sensitivity).
The function of the other pot, R160, is presently unknown since it doesn't
appear to have any effect.  But some versions (more or less random) have
labeled holes in the cover to get to both pots.  So, that second pot must
be important for something!
<p>
<b>Power and user control</b>
<p>
A 5 VDC power supply rated at least 10 A is recommended, though these lasers
do not use anywhere near that much current.  The power connector is an AMP
Universal Mate-N-Lock with 4 pins in-line.  The required plug for the
power supply cable uses female contacts.  The left two pins (3 and 4) are
+5 VDC; the right two pins (1 and 2) are Ground.  There appears to be a reverse
polarity protection diode across the DC input.  It's an SMT part labeled
"KE97E".  This part was shorted on one controller I acquired, probably due
to someone applying, err, reverse polarity.  (I replaced it with a 1N4007
with no problem since there are convenient vias to use as through-hole pads.)
<p>
The laser can be controlled either via a DB25 connector with analog and
digital signals, or via a DB9 RS232 port to a terminal or PC.
<p>
<b>Analog control via the user interface connector</b>
<p>
The quickest way to test one of these systems is to wire up a DB25M
connector as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pins 1, 2, and 14 connected together.
<li>Pin 12 connected to pin 24.
<li>Pin 13 connected to pin 25.
<li>Attach a variable power supply (0 to +4 V max) between pin 8 (plus)
 and pin 9 (minus, Ground) and set it to 0 V.
</ul>
<p>
When DC power is applied, all five status LEDs will come on momentarily and
then the red "Internal Fault" LED should go off.  After 30 seconds or so,
the red "Thermal Fault" LED should also go off indicating that the
LD and RES (if present) TECs have reached operating temperature (within
some window).  Between immediately after this and a minute or so, there
should be a beam, though depending on the particular laser, it may be
quite weak.  I'm not sure why there may be a long delay on some lasers
but it may have to do with how far the temperature(s) must be changed.
At this point the laser is running in constant current mode.  After
approximately 3 more minutes, it will switch over to constant power
mode and the beam intensity will probably change - becoming very weak
since there is 0 V on the power control signal.  Then adjusting the
variable power supply will control laser power with almost instantaneous
response.  But this is not an analog modulation input.  It is sampled
by an A/D and the resulting digital value is used by the uController
to adjust output power just as if the RS232 port were used (see below).
The allowable range is 0 to 4 V, with rated power being achieved at around
3 V if calibrated properly.  The LD current limit will
prevent damage to the diode if attempting to set the power too high (and
the green "Laser in Specifications" LED will go off and then the red
"Internal Fault" LED will go on) but I don't recommend
depending on the current limit to protect the overall laser - restrict the
output power to approximately the rated power of the laser head.  Some of
these laser heads may not survive running much above rated power due
to crystal damage, but I don't know which ones specifically.
<p>
There is a source of +5 VDC on pin 10 of the DB25 connector that can be
used with a pot for this purpose.  Pin 16 - "Laser emission on (Status)" -
can also be used as a source of +5 VDC as it is pulled to very close to
+5 VDC when the laser is enabled.  Its impedance is under 300 ohms and may
be better protected against shorts since it's a signal than pin 10, though
I don't know for sure.  A 10K ohm pot with a 4.7K ohm resistor between the
top terminal and pin 10 or pin 16, the bottom terminal to pin 9
(Digital/Analog ground), and the wiper to pin 8 (Set laser power) works quite
well, with a range of near 0 mW to about 10 percent above the rated power.
Using an audio-taper pot (rather than linear) may be useful to allow for
better resolution at low power.  I mention this because the nice pot that
I had handy that fit the electrical and space requirements (must fit into
a DB25 shell) happened to be audio-taper, and that works quite well.
<p>
When powering down, I prefer to first reduce the laser output power to minimum
before killing power or turning the laser off via the digital input (or RS232
port), but this really is not necessary.
<p>
<b>Digital control via the RS232 port</b>
<p>
The RS232 connection requires a DB9M to DB9F cable with only pins 2, 3, and 5
used where pins 2 and 3 are swapped between the computer and laser.  Run a
terminal emulation program (I assume no one actually owns real terminals
anymore!).  I use an ancient version of "Procomm Plus".  A copy may be
downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lwe221/pcplus.zip">PCPLUS.ZIP</A>.  It
will run on any PC under DOS or in a DOS window under Win3.x/95/98, but
hung trying to run on WinME and WIN2000.  The fact that it's a 1988 DOS
program can't be an excuse to misbehave, can it? :)
<p>
The COM port should be set for 9600 baud, 8 bits, and no parity.  (Some
firmware versions are very fussy about this, so if there is no response
or a peculiar response, try other combinations.)  Set the keyboard for upper
case.  Running with half duplex and automatic LF-with-CR will aid in
readability but isn't essential.  A valid command consists of an UPPER CASE
name, possibly followed by a numeric parameter, and terminated by
Carriage Return (CR).  An acknowledgement is returned if the command
is successful.  If not, there will be something like
"?!".  A "Screen Snapshot" or "Log File" option
in your terminal emulator may come in handy.  It seems that the
first command issued after power on will always fail (probably due to
garbage in some buffer), but after that, they
work as advertised.  But, there is no way to correct errors (e.g., BS
and DEL are not handled properly), so just hit CR and the bogus command will
be rejected.
<p>
With the DB25 user interface connector wired as described above, the RS232
port can be used to monitor various parameters including the laser diode
current, output power, temperature(s), and TEC current(s), but cannot be
used to adjust anything.
<p>
To have full control, wire up another DB25M with ONLY pins 1, 2, and 14
jumpered together.  The laser will then power up disabled until the
appropriate RS232 commands are issued.  As with control via the DB25
connector, there will be a delay before the laser enters constant power
mode.  The laser will acknowledge power-based commands but will not
actually execute them during the initialization period.  However, unlike
the analog control, it will execute current-based commands as soon as
the "Thermal Fault" LED goes off.  But there is a 5 second CDRH delay
before the beam appears.
<p>
The minimal commands to turn on the laser would be (CR is the RETURN key):
<p>
<ul>
<li>ON_C&lt;CR> - Turn laser on in constant current mode)
<p>
<li>ON_L&lt;CR> - Turn laser on in constant power (light) mode.
<p>
<li>SLC nnnn&lt;CR> - Switch to (or remain in) constant current mode and set
 current to nnnn/2000 amps.  Multiple SLC commands can be issued to change
 diode current.  Although any value can be entered and will be acknowledged,
 both the value stored and the actual current will never exceed the current
 limit obtained from the laser head EEPROM.
<p>
<li>SLP nnnn&lt;CR> - Switch to (or remain in) constant power mode and set
 power to nnnn*K/4096 mW.  K=15 for a 10 mW laser, 25 for a 20 mW laser,
 and 60 for a 50 mW laser.  The parameter nnnn can range from 0 to 4095.
 Above this it either wraps or is interpreted as 0.  Multiple SLP commands
 can be issued to change output power once the initialization period has
 elapsed.  The maximum power which can be produced will be the lessor of
 the value specified at K=4095 and the power available at the diode
 current limit.  Note that power calibration depends on the setting of
 the R168 pot.  So, if this has been adjusted, the K value won't be accurate.
<p>
<li>QUERY&lt;CR> - Return laser status including temperature(s), output power,
 diode current, and much more mostly useless stuff.
<p>
<li>LOFF&lt;CR> - Turn laser off.
</ul>
<p>
The user manual with complete analog and digital interface descriptions
for a very similar laser can be found at:
<A HREF="http://repairfaq.cis.upenn.edu/Misc/Lasers/uGreen/G50manual.pdf">JDSU
G50/CDPS532M Manual</A>.  This is the same controller (at least physically and
functionally), but the laser head seems to be a single-TEC version that
differs slightly from what I've seen, and there may also be subtle
differences in the format of some commands, particularly what the
QUERY command returns in its flag fields.
<p>
<b>More on the controller</b>
<p>
These are based on a Motorola 68HC711 uController chip which handles the
initialization, processes user interface and RS232 commands, monitors
error conditions, and runs the outer control loops.  Although some
versions of the 68HC711 have built-in EEPROM, reprogrammability is probably
not a requirement here.
<p>
The only obvious hardware difference between the single-TEC and dual-TEC
controllers is that the single-TEC version has a small mezzanine PCB soldered
to the laser head connector under the bottom PCB.  This small PCB has a serial
EEPROM that tells the controller about the parameters of the single-TEC laser
head, which itself has no EEPROM.  Removing that PCB <i>mostly</i> converts
a single-TEC controller into a dual-TEC controller.  However, while it seems
to function properly, readback (via the QUERY command) of the temperature
for the RES TEC always returns 0.  But the temperature control seems to
work fine as indicated by the readback of the TEC current when finger heat is
applied, and that behavior of a dual-TEC laser head seems the same on
both a genuine dual-TEC controller and one that has been converted.
That one anomaly is associated with the lower PCB, not
firmware or the upper PCB.  But all except for one component are installed
on both units and nearly all have the same values on both units.  The two-TEC
controller lacked a 1K resistor so I installed one but there was no change.
I checked the values of about half the resistors and all were the same except
for 2 that were 4.75K rather than 47.5K.  But the two resistors were on
opposite ends of the PCB and unlikely to be associated with only the RES
temperature reading as 0.  And, with the one-TEC converted to a two-TEC
controller, swapping the uController chips then does make a difference -
only the original one allows the Thermal Fault LED to turn off and the
laser to turn on.  So, there must be at least subtle differences in the
firmware.
<p>
The dual-TEC controller reads the major operating parameters from the
serial EEPROM in the laser head.  These include the LD current limit,
LD temperature, and RES temperature, and possibly others.  While I have not
totally confirmed this works with all laser heads that have an EEPROM,
it is too consistent to be random chance.  But since many of the laser heads
I have for testing have had parts swapped, their EEPROM contents
may not apply to all of their parameters.  So, those that are questionable
and don't operate with optimal settings may simply have EEPROM values that
don't apply to the organ donor.  Thus it would seem that a two-TEC controller
does not need to be matched to a specific two-TEC laser head except
possibly to adjust the the photodiode (light feedback) sensitivity
(which is the R168 pot, though there could also be a digital calibration
value stored in the EEPROM).  However, note that this is not quite the
same as the approach taken by the Coherent C315M where the approximate
parameters are read and then the controller optimizes them during
initialization.  The uGreen controller just reads the values and goes
with them.  But it is not known if this applies to all uGreen laser heads
with EEPROMs.  Of course it won't work with a 4301 or 4501 which
lack an EEPROM (and the laser head connector pinout also differs
so the straight HD15 to HD15 cable may result in smoke).  It should
work with the 4601, 4611, and other laser heads with a similar pinout.
<p>
There may be several versions of the 4802 since I've heard that one sample
would not run a 4601 head at all even with the EEPROM PCB removed.  It
simply turned on the fault LED and returned 4096s for the first 6
parameters of the Query command.  For this controller, the firmware is:
G50 21015063 Rev. 1 Build #4.  (I think I have one of these also.)
But another sample of a similar controller did work as expected with
a specific version of the G50 laser head.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#scljuugw5">uGreen CDPS532M/G50 Laser Head Wiring</A>.
<p>
The PCB layout appears to have been revised sometime after the year 2000.
A controller with a manufacturing date of 2003 has parts rearranged
internally with all the power transistors and/or MOSFETS having their
heatsink on the sides instead of the bottom of the case.  It's not
clear how much the electronic design has changed though.  And
it still has the little EEPROM mezzanine PCB for the single-TEC laser head
soldered to the HD15 connector pins underneath the bottom PCB.
<p>
Since there is no EEPROM inside the single-TEC laser heads, the controller
needs the internal kludge PCB with its EEPROM, as noted above.  Thus,
single-TEC laser heads and controllers must be matched for optimal
performance.  And actual damage may result if the LD current limit of the
laser head is lower than the one stored in the controller's EEPROM.
<p>
There are corresponding differences in the behavior of the RS232
software between the single-TEC and dual-TEC controllers,
particularly the QUERY command which at the very least, returns
two additional values in the otherwise unused positions that are
the temperature and TEC current for the second TEC.  (However, those
supposedly unused positions may not always be 0, just not something that
corelates with anything.)  But attempting to
use a functional single-TEC controller on a dual-TEC laser head results
in peculiar and potentially damaging behavior as it drives the TECs at
full current - at least in the one test I tried.  They were going down
past absolute zero before I klled power. :)  This probably makes sense
as the EEPROM on the kludge PCB and the one in the laser head both
attempt to return parameters that may then be logically ORed together!
<p>
Where the operating parameters stored in the laser head are not correct
(as might be the case if the LD was replaced) or a single-TEC laser head
is not mated to the proper controller, not all is lost.
For the temperature set-points at least, a similar
workaround to that described in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpat">Adjustment of
Temperature Set-Points in Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A> may be
used to adapt a controller to a laser head.
There is enough space inside the laser heads (particularly, dual-TEC
versions) to solder tiny trimpots across or in series with the temperature
sensor thermistors pins.  Adjustments can then be made while the
laser is operating at the desired power level to minimize LD current.
CAUTION: Take care that the LD current limit for the actual LD installed
in the head is not exceeded if the stored current limit is higher!
<p>

respect to modifying and saving parameters, the mystery pot, or would simply
like to ask specific questions, please contact me via the

<h3><A NAME="scljuugp">Powering the uGreen Laser Head with a Third-Party or
 Home-Built Controller</A></h3>

If a Uniphase controller is available, then that is
generally easier unless the laser is to be used in some unconventional
way - requiring wavelength tuning, for example.  The following assumes
that the laser head is in good working condition.
<p>
Driving the uGreen laser head will require a laser diode driver and one
or two TEC controllers depending on model.  On at least some uGreen heads,
the temperature sensors share a common wire which needs to be taken into
account with some commercial controllers or modules.  Other than this,
there should be no problems in using a lab-style controller like the ILX
Lightwave LDC-3900, modules such as those from Wavelength Electronics, or
a cobbled together collection of power supplies (though I don't recommend
the latter due to their lack of feedback control).
<p>
What's needed is the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Disable shorting relay:</b> On some models (e.g., 4500, 4600) there
 is a solid state MOS relay which shorts the pump diode when no power is
 applied.  This requires +5 VDC to disable relay.  However, neglecting to
 do this doesn't seem to cause any damage to either the laser head or
 controller, but about 50 mA of the current will bypass the diode.
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode driver:</b> Constant current adjustable up to the maximum
 current rating of the pump diode, probably around 1.5 A.
 The photodiode output of the uGreen can be used to control optical
 power after everything else is stable.  Just make sure the current
 limit is set to a value safe for the pump diode!
<p>
<li><b>LD TEC:</b> 4 A should be adequate.  The temperature sensor is a
 10K NTC thermistor.
<p>
<li><b>Cavity TEC:</b> 2 A should be adequate.  The temperature
 sensor is a 10K NTC thermistor.  (A separate cavity TEC is not available
 on some models.)
</ul>
<p>
Note the relatively high current for the TECs, probably because the laser was
designed to run on 5 VDC.  The actual current that is required will depend
on the tempareture set-point, heatsinking, ambient temperature, and
(especially for the pump diode), the pump diode operating current.
<p>
With a lab-style controller, the diode current and temperature(s)
will be available on the front panel.  Otherwise, you'll have to provide
some means of monitoring them.  A unit similar to the one for the C532
would be suitable but some modifications will be required to adapt it
to the uGreen design.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc532a">C532 Control Panel and Test Adapter</A>
for a complete design.  Multiple meters can also be used but is much
less convenient.
<p>
Power up the diode at about 0.5 A cooled to around 15 &deg;C.  Make sure
the head is mounted on an adequate heatsink!  The typical
threshold is under 0.4 A when everything else is optimal.  If there is green
light, the rest is trivial.  Slowly adjust the LD TEC for maximum output.
Its response is quite slow - allow 15 to 30 seconds for the temperature
to stabilize after small adjustments.  Once the best temperature for the LD
TEC has been found, do the same for the Cavity TEC (if available).
The cavity temperature also changes slowly.  The laser output is probably
a broad peak with small ripples.  The optimal temperature
is where the broad peak and a ripple are maximum.  Now, increase pump
diode current to produce the desired level of light output.  The LD
temperature will need to be adjusted somewhat to again maximize output.
The Cavity temperature will also need to be adjusted, but much less so.
<p>
If there is no green light at 0.5 A, try 1 A.  If still none, the laser
head may be out of alignment or the pump diode or KTP may be damaged.  All
uGreen laser heads I've tested would produce green light at under 1 A even
without controlling the TECs.

<h4><A NAME="scljuugx">Powering the uGreen Laser Head With the ILX Lightwave
 Model LDC-3900</A></h4>

The following applies to the 4601, 4611, 4711, 4712 (henceforth referred to
as 4601), 4301 and 4501, and many other dual TEC uGreen laser heads including
possibly the 4617 though it uses much larger TECs.  For those with only a
single TEC, it should be even simpler though the TECs used in the lasers
I tested like the 4702 behaved somewhat strange and resulted in a
"TEC Open" error if run with a 4 A current limit.  When run with a 2 A
current limit, it was not possible to maintain the selected temperature
below about 25 &deg;C even with the pump current at zero.  I'm
not sure if this is normal behavior or a symptom of the failure mode of
these particular lasers.  Maybe I just needed a much better good heatsink
(though this didn't matter for any of the other lasers).
<p>
Having already built a cable adapter to run the C315M on an LDC-3900
(see the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclccilx">Powering the C315M
with the ILX Lightwave Model LDC-3900</A>), it was a simple matter to build
an adapter to <i>it</i> providing the connections needed for any of the uGreen
laser heads, a subset of the C315M (one or two TECs instead of three).
The pinout was made the same as the HYB B controller so the
the standard 4601 HYB B or 4301/4501 HYB B cables could then be used for the
two TEC uGreen laser heads.  (CAUTION: Different HYB B cable pinouts
required for the 4601 and 4301!)  The only addition needed was a  
separate 5 VDC power supply to disable the MOS shorting relay in the
4601, 4611, 4711, and 4712 laser heads.  (Though I've yet to see any damage
result if this isn't done as the on-resistance of the MOS relay is so high
that only about 100 to 150 mA actually flows through it.  At the 2 V drop of
the laser diode, this is barely enough to cause the IC to become noticeably
warm.)  (To drive the single TEC uGreen laser heads, another HYB B compatible
cable could be built or the standard HD15F to DB9M controller cable can be
used with the 4601 HYB B cable.  So, in all there would be three adapter
cables in series for these lasers in the latter case!)

For the 4601, Only the LDC-3900 modules for the LD driver, LD TEC, and
RES TEC were used.  The TEC modules were set up with the default constants
rather than for higher resolution as with the C315M.  The current limit on
the LD was set for 1 A and on the TECs, to 4 A.
<p>
The response of the uGreen laser head was much more like that of the
C532 - a broad peak for the LD temperature and a periodic ripple
with an overall maximum for the cavity temperature.  The broad peak
is likely due to the KTP acting as a birefringent filter and should
have a period of approximately 30 &deg;C based on the 3 mm KTP length.
The ripple is due to the lasing mode moving with respect to the
vanadate gain bandwidth.
<p>
It was quite easy to maximize output power with only these two variables to
manipulate.  However, due to the very slow response for both 4601 TECs,
it took awhile to find the best settings.  (Response of the 4301 TECs
was much faster for some reason.)  In addition, the thermistors
appear to be mounted far enough away from the laser diode and KTP that
the actual response of the laser lagged the temperature (or thermistor
resistance) displayed on the LDC-3900 front panel.  Also related to
this was the requirement that the head cover be in place to achieve
the desired temperatures and more importantly, for it to correlate with
the setpoint, especially when cooling significantly (i.e., 17.5 &deg;c).
Some foam insulation might help as well.
<p>
Here are the values found for two uGreen 4600 laser heads.  ID #1 had
its damaged KTP reinstalled so I'm not surprised that it isn't producing
much power.  ID #2 was original weak but removal, cleaning, and
realignment of the KTP restored it to a condition which is probably
close to normal.

<p>
Since the scanning Fabry-Perot interometer was already set up, I also confirmed
that these uGreen laser heads were actually running single mode (single
frequency) as promised by the specifications.  As with
the C315M (see the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315s">Testing the
C315M Laser Head for Single Frequency Operation</A>), the output was
stable single mode under most conditions.  Only in some valleys of the
output with respect to cavity temperature was there some indication of
instability, though no actual additional modes ever appeared.
<p>
A few months after these tests, I did some more careful alignment of
these as well as well as a dozen or so other uGreen lasers.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strju4600m">Examples of Minor Repairs to
uGreen Lasers</A>.

<h3><A NAME="sclugwlt">Wavelength Tuning of uGreen Lasers</A></h3>

While the uGreen is a single longitudinal mode (single frequency) laser,
the actual frequency is not specified, and in fact may vary by up to
10s of GHz depending on the model.  And, changing the output power will
actually tune the frequency/wavelength because of the different heating
inside the KTP and corresponding change in its optical length (among
other things).  So, one way to tune the frequency is to adjust output
power via the DB15 interface connector.
<p>
To slightly adjust the wavelength of any laser, what's needed is to be able
to control the cavity length.  The maximum continuous tuning range will be
the FSR (Free Spectral Range) of the cavity.  (FSR is c/2L where c is the
speed of light and L is the effective optical length of the cavity.)
The cavity of the 4601 and similar discrete crystal uGreen lasers is about
between 10 to 15 GHz.  The cavity length of the microchip composite crystal
uGreen 4301 and 4501 is more than 50 GHz with its very short cavity.  However,
the temperature tuning sensitivity is reversed.  The sensitivity of the
microchip laser is 3 to 5 GHz per &deg;C while the much longer discrete
crystal cavity is 20 to 30 GHz per &deg;C.  So, the microchip 4301 and 4501
lasers have both a larger continuous tuning range and a much more convenient
temperature range to tune it - 10 or 20 &deg;C versus less than 1 &deg;C.
<p>
I tested the tuning of a 4301-20 on the ILX LDC-3900 laboratory controller.
Varying the LD current, LD temperature, or RES temperature all would change
the frequency, but using the RES temperature is probably the most direct
with the least side effects.  (LD current and temperature affect the cavity
length due to changes of the amount of pump light absorbed in the crystals,
and thus their heat dissipation and temperature.)  The frequency change
was detected by shining the beam through an iodine absorption cell.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioiivcr">The Iodine
Vapor Cell Wavelength Reference</A>.)
Each dip in <A HREF="i532a1.gif">Iodine Absorption Spectrum
Near 532 nm</A> means the iodine vapor is absorbing
some of the incident light and the gas will actually fluoresce
a green or green-yellow color, which is actually a combination of many
wavelengths including some red ones.  The lower the dip, the brighter it
will glow and also reduce the light coming out the other end.  I'm not
quite sure where the exact center of the Nd:YVO4 gain curve would fall on this
plot.  Corrections and additions welcome.
As the RES temperature was varied from
15 &deg;C to 35 &deg;C, the glow in the cell went on and off with varying
intensity.  The brightest glow occurred at several places and resulted
in roughly 20 percent of the beam power being absorbed passing through
the iodine cell.  For this experiment,
I wasn't actually measuring wavelength so I don't know how much of the FSR
was actually covered.  Based on microchip lasers with similar size cavity
lengths and construction, a tuning sensitivity of 3 to 5 GHz per &deg;C
can be expected.  So, the 20 &deg;C range could have resulted in tuning across
more than the full FSR of the cavity, and thus cover all the iodine
lines possible with this laser.
<p>
If using the HYB B controller, the internal RES temperature adjustment
could be used but this isn't exactly convenient, so the pot could be rewired
to be external if desired.  Of course, varying the RES temperature will
have some effect on output power, though probably less with the 4301 and
4501 than with the 4601 and similar discrete crystal laser heads.

<h4><A NAME="scljuugc1">uGreen 4601 Laser Head Construction</A></h4>

The following also applies to the 4611 and 4711 (and I assume other) lasers.
The 4712 is almost identical but has added some sort of active circuit
associated with the photodiode (circuit and function unknown).  Depending
on model and revision, the actual laser resonator with the vanadate, KTP,
and OC mirror, may be removable as a unit from what is called the "Laser
Cavity Module" below.
<p>
The laser head consists of 3 very small modules mounted on an solid metal
frame.  Please refer to the photo in

 when handling the laser head.

Between the two lenses is an aperture to block the ghost beams that result
from the laser cavity design.
<p>
Electrical interconnections between the HD15 connector and the three modules
is via a custom ribbon cable assembly which also includes a few discrete
components.
<p>
Details of the internal construction, cleaning, and alignment of the model
4600 laser head can be found in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strju4600d">The Model 4600 SLM uGreen Laser</A>.

<h4><A NAME="scljuugc2">uGreen 4617 Laser Head Construction</A></h4>

This is a somewhat larger and heavier laser which is optically similar
to the 4601 but is constructed somewhat differently.  The pump and cavity
modules are glued together and to the thick baseplate casting (via their
TECs) so that any non-destructive disassembly is virtually impossible.
Photos of the salvaged modules from a 4617 that apparently lost a fight
with a dumpster are shown in:
<A HREF="ug4617-1.jpg">Uniphase uGreen 4617 Pump and Cavity</A>.
These are separated only because the TECs split in half (all the
junctions broke off) and the glue between the pump and cavity
modules came free.  There used to be a somewhat more complex flex
circuit (compared to the 4601) all along the top of the laser,
additional functions unknown.  The green sticker covers where the
photodiode is supposed to be located.  As can be seen, it still
lases fine.  These are tough lasers. :)  But without the TECs,
there is no way to stabilize operation.

<h4><A NAME="scljuugc3">uGreen 4301 Laser Head Construction</A></h4>

This is a somewhat older version of the uGreen laser.  But the likely
later model 4501 is virtually identical.  Instead of a short
discrete cavity, it uses a Multi-Chip Assembly (MCA), a sandwich of
a piece of vanadate and KTP with mirrors coated on the input and output
surfaces.  It to be optically contacted (edge glued).  Thus, the actual laser
is very simple consisting of the MCA glued to a copper heatsink plate.
<p>
The laser head still consists of 3 very small modules mounted on an solid
metal frame like the others, though the wiring is just done with wires.
How quaint. :)
<p>
Pleae refer to the photo in

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser Diode Module:</b> This includes the actual laser diode itself
 (C-block, not lensed) and part of the beam shaping optics.  TEC1 and

 handling the laser head!

</ul>
<p>
The output optics consist of a beam expander telescope (negative and positive

<p>
Note that although the same basic components are present in the 4601, 4611,
4711, and 4301 and 4501 laser heads, the connector pin assignments are totally
different.  Attempting to power the 4301 or 4501 on the HYB B with a 4601 cable
will result in smoke (or at least a burning smell).  There was apparently
no damage but I never did find out what was burning!
<p>
One interesting characteristic of the 4301 that sets it apart from the
4601 and other similar laser heads is the behavior of its TECs.  Both the
LD and RES TECs have a much faster response.  I don't know if this is because
the material used for the module castings has better heat transfer or if the
TECs have a higher capacity for the same current.  But it is indeed
easier to tune this laser since there is much less waiting!

<h4><A NAME="scljuugc4">uGreen 4702 Laser Head Construction</A></h4>

This is a much smaller and simpler laser head using a pump and resonator
combined into a one unit with a single large TEC.  The laser unit is glued
to the TEC which is glued to the base so removal in its entirety is not
possible.  However, with a bit of work, access to the inside of the cavity
may be achieved to inspect and clean the vanadate, and clean and adjust the
KTP.  With a very thin piece of lens tissue, cleaning of the OC mirror
might be done as well.

 mounting.  This is probably the most easily replaced of the uGreen pump
 diodes I've found so far though alignment may be super critical since
 there is little adjustment range.

<h2>JDS Uniphase Nanolasers</h2>

These are diode pumped lasers with a passive Q-switch, either run with the
fundamental output (1,064 nm) or with external conversion to 532 nm, 355 nm,
or 266 nm.  Apparently, they are no longer made or supported, and little
information appears to be available - none on the
<A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A> Web site.  The original
spec sheet for this as well as the "Dual Chip Nanolaser" can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage Lasers
and Accessories Brochures</A>.  A typical system is shown in
<A HREF="junl1p1.jpg">JDS Uniphase Model NV980015 Nanolaser Laser Head and
Controller</A>.  The controller contains +5 VDC and +/-12 VDC power supplies,
pump diode and TEC drivers, a power-on delay timer, and fault detection
circuits.
<p>
In addition to the pump diode, laser crystals, SHG and THG crystals, and
optics, the laser head contains feedback networks with pots to set the pump
diode current and temperature.  See <A HREF="junl1p2.jpg">JDS Uniphase
Nanolaser Model NV980015 Laser Head Components</A>.
The entire laser for the fundamental (1,064 nm) is a Multiple Chip Assembly
(MCA) consisting of a Nd:YAG lasing medium bonded to a chromium doped
YAG saturable absorber with cavity mirrors deposited on both ends.  Since
both crystals use the same YAG host, they are probably diffusion bonded.
Its total volume is 2mm<sup>2</sup> earning it the nanolaser title.  It is
clamped in a slot under the aluminum bar shown in the photo.
A Spectra-Physics style A-mount laser diode is coupled via a GRIN
lens into the MCA.  The output of the MCA is pulses at 1,064 nm
which are externally doubled in what looks like a KTP crystal
to 532 nm.  Its output is passed, along with part of
the 1,064 nm beam to a second non-linear crystal, which performs sum-frequency
mixing to produce 355 nm.  Between the MCA and SHG crystal, and
between the SHG and THG crystals, are relay/focusing lenses.
The final output is reflected off of 4 mirrors,
presumably to kill all 808 nm, 1,064 nm, and 532 nm.  At least that appears
to be how it's supposed to work.
<p>
As noted, the pump diode driver and TEC controller are in a separate power
supply/controller box while the laser head has feedback circuitry
with adjustments for the pump current and temperature.  Thus, laser
heads should be interchangeable without adjustments.  In the photo above,
the pump diode and temperature pots are on the Feedback PCB hidden behind
the clump of wires.  The pump diode pot is on the left.  One turn is
100 to 200 mA with a minimum of about 600 mA.  Clockwise is increasing
current.  The temperature pot is on the right near the wires for the
thermistor sensor (just visible above the pump diode).  Clockwise is
increasing temperature.  Turning this pot too far too fast will cause the
laser to shut down and require AC power to be cycled to restore operation.
1/8th turn in 10 seconds is probably acceptable.
<p>
As noted, there was also a "Dual Chip Nanolaser", also apparently
no longer made.  This apparently used a MOPA configuration to
provide more power than the basic Nanolaser.  All I know about it
beyond the specifications is what's inside the power supply since
I have one - basically 3 PCBs similar to those in the vanilla
flavored Nanolaser, so there may be 3 pump diodes and 3 TECs in
the laser head.
<p>
I have at least partially revived an older UV Nanolaser that behaved flawlessly
in all regards except one: It didn't lase. :) The pump diode looked like it
was working based on spill of excess pump light and it was set at 1 A,
though I've had it as high as 1.2 A without any improvement.  (There is
a 2 A fuse in the diode current supply and the manual mentions 1.6 A max,
but that's a power supply specification, not necessarily the diode current
limit.)  I adjusted the temperature so that the pump diode output is between
808 and 809 nm.  It would have been virtually impossible to measure the actual
output power of the diode in situ due to limited space so I left that for
last since it looked like restoring the original alignment would have been
equally impossible.
<p>
I wasn't even sure whether the MCA was even intact.
The crystal surface that the pump beam feeds into looks like it could be
the vanadate, or maybe the vanadate is at the far end.  What's visible is
about 1x1mm and clamped in place but I can't tell if it has a mirror.
Either way, there doesn't seem to be very much absorption of the pump
light, and no evidence of that reassuring yellow glow that is present
when vanadate is pumped with enough power density to lase.  It's almost
as though the vanadate is missing entirely.  If it did pop off, losing
it would be entirely too easy as the dimensions are likely to be something
like 1.5x1.5x0.1mm - or less.
<p>
But finally, with nothing to lose, I scribed around the diode as best I could
to provide some alignment marks, and removed and remounted it
for testing.  As it turned out, the diode was almost dead.
At 1 A, it was only producing 160 mW rather than the 600 to 750 mW
that would be normal.  The low power was confirmed using both the Nanolaser
driver and my LDC-3900.  That is, until the case of my LaserCheck touched
the diode facet.  After the odor of burnt plastic cleared, it only produced
about 50 mW. :( :)
<p>
So, I scrounged up another diode that looked similar, a 1 W Spectra-Physics
SCT100-808-Z1-01 that had been removed from an experimental laser for unknown
reasons.  It still worked though, even if the little cathode tab was broken
and somewhat short.
<p>
My first attempt at installing the new diode produced exactly nothing even
with the pump current turned up to above 1 A.  But the diode sort of appeared
to be a bit closer to the GRIN lens than I recall.  (My alignment marks
weren't extraordinarily useful!).  Pulling it back as far as it would go
resulted in a nice amount of green light (from the doubler) and a tiny
speck of fluorescence on a white piece of paper.  These were present even
at the minimal pump current setting of the pot - less than 650 mA.
Using the white portion of a Newport IR detector card resulted in a slightly
brighter blue spot.  Miraculously, the output beam alignment was almost
perfect, only requiring the slightest adjustment of the output aperture plate
for the beam to be roughly centered in the hole.
<p>
The person who sent me this laser to look at said the pulse repetition rate
was around 7 kHz.  At minimum pump current, the pulse
rate was somewhere between 3 and 4 kHz.  This was monitored on an oscilloscope
using a $2 photodiode with a 3K load resistor.  So, I increased the pump
current until the pulse rate was 7 kHz.  After a few iterations of
adjusting the diode temperature to set the pump wavelength to the absorption
peak of around 808 nm, and decreasing the diode current to maintain the 7 kHz
pulse rate, it was done - or so I thought. :)  For the 7 kHz pulse rate,
the diode current was 0.78 A.  It was only later that I found the
specifications, above, which lists 10 to 12 kHz as the normal pulse
repetition rate for this laser.  So, I then performed the pump current and temperature adjustment once again for 10 kHz, with a 0.96 A final pump current.
<p>
Then, I noticed that the beam profile was really poor.  I don't mean just
a little poor, I mean really really poor.  The shape really can't be
described.  It's sort of multimode but not with similar size spots.
It has more like a bloby appearance.  This wouldn't be
that noticeable normally since the beam is very narrow and quite well
collimated when it exits the laser with the cover in place.
But, with the cover is removed, the beam expands at a few mR and becomes
sizable quite quickly.  It probably has been messed up all along but I
didn't examine the spot that closely.  At first I thought it might just
be dirty optics but there was nothing obvious and the poor beam shape
was present all the way back to the output of the MCA, or at least the
closest point that was accessible.  That's just as well since cleaning
some of the optics would be nearly impossible anyhow.
Then on a hunch, I fiddled with the diode temperature (and thus peak
wavelength).  It seems that when the temperature is set to put the diode
wavelength at the absorption peak, the beam quality is worst.  When it's
fairly far away, the beam doesn't look *that* bad.  However, then the
pulse rate is below 6 kHz at the same diode current.  I also noticed that the
peak power as evidenced by the height of the pulse on the oscilloscope is
higher when the beam quality is better.  I've got it set as a
compromise now.  Not great but not totally dreadful. About 0.96 A and a
rep rate of 10 kHz.  If the owner doesn't care that much about beam
quality, that's how it will remain.  The only cause for the poor beam quality
that I would have any control of would be pump beam alignment.  But
adjusting that would be a royal pain since it would have to be basically
trial and error.  Moving the diode around while it's running is very risky.
So, loosen the diode, move it a bit, power up and test, repeat until pigs
fly.....  We're talking about micron precision.  In the factory, they
would have a micropositioner to move the diode or optics during alignment.
That's not exactly something I could set up unless the future of the Universe
depended on it.  And, this really doesn't have the appearance of a pump beam
alignment problem.  Since I've never played with a passively Q-switched laser
before this one, the behavior may be common requiring absorption to be
controlled to produce more uniform excitation of the lasing medium.
<p>
So, if he tells me beam quality is critical, I'll work on it.  If
he tells me it doesn't matter or is only desirable or would be kind of
nice, that's the way it's going to stay.  Or, if beam quality is more
important than average output power (lower pulse rate) or vice-versa,
it could be set appropriately.
<p>
I have no idea of the output power (average or peak) having no laser power
meters that go down to 355 nm or will report reliably with these Q-switched
pulses.  Setting my loaner Spiricon power meter with its silicon sensor
to 400 nm - as low as it will go - results in a reading of around 100 uW.
This laser should produce about 1 to 2 mW of average power at 355 nm.  But
a semiconductor sensor isn't likely to be able to deal with the high
peak power of the Q-switched pulses - it will simply saturate.  So, the
correct pulse rate will have to do as evidence of success, maybe. :)
<p>
Interestingly, there is a 1,064 nm beam present at a slight angle to the main
beam that is normally blocked by the cover.  But, a strategically placed
hole could be added.  And, if those final 4 mirrors were removed and replaced
with just an 808 nm-blocking filter, this might be a nice three wavelength
laser. :)  This could be done rather easily and would be reversible because
the entire group of mirrors is mounted on a single removable platform.
And, it is a pity so much power at 532 nm and 1,064 nm is going to waste.
<p>
A few years later, I had the opportunity to test several 266 nm Nanolaser
systems.  They have an NU1 part number but I'm not quite sure what it might
have been since these specific lasers were evidently engineering test units
for some OEM application and had only incomplete model information.
The controller is identical to the one used with the other Nanolaser.
But unlike the normal Nanolasers found in the brochure, above, the laser
heads are hermetically sealed as shown in <A HREF="junu1h1.jpg">JDS Uniphase
Model NU1 Nanolaser Laser Head View 1</A> and <A HREF="junu1h2.jpg">JDS
Uniphase Model NU1 Nanolaser Laser Head View 2<</A>.  There is something
similar to a Schnader (bicycle tire) valve covered by the blue cap.  That
flange on the front must have been intended to mate with some specific
piece of equipment, sealed with an O-ring.
<p>
NU1 would normally mean 1 mW, though the average output power
of these lasers ranged from 8 to 12 mW as measured with a
thermal laser power meter.  The repetition rate ranged from
at a 9 to 11 kHz.  Assuming this laser is similar to the
standard NU1, the specs say that the pulse width is less than 800 ps which
would translate into over 1 kW peak power!
The output beam exits via a Brewster window, probably
made of quartz as 266 nm isn't transmitted by optical glass.  In
fact, the lack of anything passing through a small lens that I wanted
to use to try to focus the beam was my only real confirmation of the
wavelength.  I have no wavelength determining instruments that go down
to 266 nm and of course that wavelength is totally invisible to the
naked eye, though it's almost impossible to find anything that
<i>doesn't</i> fluoresce violet or blue or a longer wavelength
in the beam.
<p>
I also tested a few other model Nanolasers - NP (IR, 1,064 nm) and NG (green,
532 nm).  Placing a piece of KTP (intended for a uGreen laser, roughly
3x3x3 mm) in the beam of the NP laser resulted in some green light without
any focusing, and 1 or 2 mW of green conversion with a short focal length lens.
<p>
Here is a partial pinout of the laser head to power supply cable for the
newer (e.g., 2003) Nanolasers with two pots.  (Note that what I'm calling
a "power supply" here generates +/-15 VDC and +5 VDC for an internal
LD driver and TEC controller PCB, which feeds the laser head via a
DB9M connector.  There are at least 3 versions of the Nanolaser power
supplies (not counting the differences between OEM and end-user models.
I have tested two of these (called "older" and "newer" here) and have
heard of the third (which is probably even newer).
<p>
<PRE>
  Pin  Function
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1   LD Anode (+, case), LM317LZ In on newer lasers (probably +5 VDC).
   2   NC
   3   GND, Thermistor.
   4   LD current setpoint (pot further from LD).  NC on older lasers.
   5   TEC-
   6   LD Cathode (-, tab)
   7   Thermistor, 4.2K ohms to pin 3 (at about 27&degC).
   8   Temperature setpoint (pot closer to LD).
   9   TEC+
</PRE>
<p>
This pinout has been confirmed by running a variety
of Nanolaser heads on my LDC 3900 lab controller using an adapter cable.
The pot settings are ignored for these tests since the pots are NOT
directly in either the LD current path or thermistor
sense circuitry.  Their settings are reference voltages for LD current and
temperature which are returned to the controller.
<p>
Newer Nanolaser power supplies have no pots and a bipolar TEC driver (heat
and cool).  As listed above, the newer heads have two pots.  Both pots
are fed from an LM317LZ, probably running off +5 VDC.  Attempting to change
the temperature too quickly may cause the laser to shut down.  Power cycle
to restore operation.  The only other electronic components inside the laser
heads are a half dozen SMT resistors and a pair of L-C-L (potted ferrite
beads with a capacitor) noise filters.
<p>
Older Nanolaser power supplies have only a single pot in the head and it
is for temperature.  The TEC drivers in these lasers are unipolar - can
only cool.The only other electronic components in the laser head are 3
or 4 SMT resistors and a pair of noise filters.  With no separate regulator
inside the laser head, that temperature setting must have varied too much,
thus the LM317LZ in newer heads.  The associated controllers
have 2 pots, at least one of which I assume is for the LD current.  It is not
known whether these older controllers were supposed to match up with a
specific laser head, or whether the LD current setting was considered
not to be critical, if you can believe that.  But the current
adjustment is not easy to make given the disassembly required to get
to the pots - 4 case screws, 2 DB9 screws, carefully separate power
supply base from heatsink and PCB while avoiding flexing and breaking
the transistor leads.  What were they thinking?  OK, "Factory setting,
do not touch". :)
<p>
The end-user Nanolaser power supplies have a keylock switch, interlock
jumper, and detachable power cord as shown in <A HREF="junl1p1.jpg">JDS
Uniphase Model NV980015 Nanolaser Laser Head and Controller</A> and in
the Nanolaser brochure.
<p>
The newer ones have red (Power) and green (Laser ON) LEDs (on the side of
the case with the laser head connector, hidden in the above photo) but visible
in the Nanolaser brochure.  They are rated at 1.4 A for the laser diode driver.
The laser diode driver and TEC controller are both on a single small PCB
inside the power supply box.  Take care disassembling it as the PCB is
attached to the cover via the DB9 screws, and its three power Darlington
transsitors are screwed to the heatsink.  They break off easily but are
common parts so are easily replaced!
<p>
The PCB is identical to the ones used in the Dual Chip Nanolaser power supply,
but there are three identical PCBs in that unit - one associated with
the LD and TEC for each of the dual chips, and another PCB that's only
used as a TEC controller for the overall laser.  Or something. :)
<p>
The OEM controllers have no LEDs, keylock switch, or interlock jumper plug
and the power cord is permanently attached.
<p>
Older power supplies are only rated at 1.1 A for the laser diode driver and
are lighter in weight than the newer ones.  They are also
NOT compatible with newer laser heads, and the lower current is
insufficient for some UV (NV and NU) lasers.  The older
laser heads have a single pot which I believe is for LD current
(but it's on a different pin than in the newer laser heads, see
the chart above), with the temperature set via a pot inside the power supply.
(Or it might be the other way around!)
Their TEC controller is also unipolar - it can only cool.
<p>
WARNING: These lasers are potentially far more dangerous to vision than might
be expected from their average power of only a few mW and pulse energy of
around 1 uJ.  The peak power in each
pulse can exceed 1 kiloWATT!  It's not clear what effect such short high
peak power ~1 ns pulses might have, but taking precautions for pulsed lasers
would be prudent, including the use of appropriate laser safety
eye wear.  With the head cover in place on an unmodified laser, the only
wavelength of concern should be the design wavelength - e.g., 355 nm for
an "NV".  But with the cover removed, all intermediate wavelengths
(1,064 nm and 532 nm for the "NV") can be present with higher peak power.
And some stray beams may come out at unexpected angles!  If one doubts
the wisdom of this recommendation, consider the test above getting substantial
green conversion with KTP in the output beam!  That takes high peak power.

<h2>Melles Griot Low Power DPSS Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sclmggcs">The Melles Griot 58-GCS Series Green DPSS Laser</A></h3>

The 58-GCS series are compact self-contained green DPSS lasers listed as
suitable for applications including reprographics, spectroscopy, and diagnostic
instrumentation.
<p>
The most notable feature of these lasers is that they are based on a
composite crystal rather than separate vanadate, KTP, and OC mirror.
However, the crystal is optically contacted rather than glued (like the
CASIX DPM0101 or DPM0102) so there is no problem with damage from high
intracavity flux.
<p>
Here is a summary of what I was told about the design of this DPSS laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>These are microchip lasers using a composite vanadate/KTP crystal with
 integral (flat-flat) mirrors.  The physical cavity length is approximately
 1.5 mm.  The crystals are optically contacted, not glued, so that degradation
 from high intracavity flux isn't a problem.
<p>
<li>Maximum output power is 20 mW for the commercial product, up to 70 mW or
 more in the lab.
<p>
<li>There is (unspecified) pump beam correction.  I assume that this is one
 of the main things that improves the beam quality of these lasers compared
 to green DPSS laser pointers. :)  From inspection of a 58-GCS-405 (the
 5 mW version), the pump beam correction may be not more than a relay
 lens.
<p>
<li>There is a single TE cooler, maintaining the pump diode at its happiest
 operating point and optimal wavelength.  The crystal temperature is not
 separately controlled
<p>
<li>There is optical feedback to maintain constant output power.
<p>
<li>In addition to an angled beam sampler plate for the optical feedback
 photodiode, there is also a beamsplitter cube, most likely acting as
 an IR-blocking filter by deflecting any 808 nm or 1,064 nm photons
 out of the beam path.  There is also an angled plate of unknown function.
<p>
<li>There are user accesssible trimpots for diode current, output power
 (presumably subject to the diode current), and Temperature.
<p>
<li>The only documented external connections (via an HD15 connector) are
 power (+5 VDC at 2 A max), ground, and shield, as well as a separate
 BNC that must be shorted to provide the interlock.  However, there are
 5 other pins on the HD15 that go to the internal PCB whose functions
 are unknown.
<p>
<li>The only indicator is a yellow LED for Emission.
<p>
<li>There are both a keylock switch and slide switch to turn on the laser.
</ul>
<p>
Here are some photos:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="mggcs-l1.jpg">Melles Griot 58-GCS-405 Green DPSS Laser</A>
 shows the overall unit.  The 58-GCS-405 is rated 5 mW.  The one I have
 came with a massive heatsink that bolts underneath, but I can't imagine
 that is essential for a 5 mW laser.  Someone may have attempted to
 modify it for higher power.
<p>

 assembly (in aluminum cylinder), beam sampler plate and photodiode (attached
 to orange and blue wires), angled plate (function unknown), and beamsplitter
 cube (function unknown but may be IR-blocking filter).
<p>
<li><A HREF="mggcs-e1.jpg">Electronics Board of Melles Griot 58-GCS-405 Green
 DPSS Laser</A> shows one side of the main PCB.  I'm surprised that there are
 so many jumper wires on what looks like a production laser.  That orange
 wire shouldn't be there (see below) but the others seem to be original.
 There are also components on the back of the PCB.
</ul>
<p>
Go to: <A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> and search
for "DPSS lasers" for general specifications and more product information.
The current model designation seems to have changed to 85-GCA-005 or
85-GCB-005.  The difference in these two lasers seems to have something
to do with the output optics, but both are clearly derived from the
design used in the 58-GCS.
<p>
The 58-GCS-405 I acquired on eBay had problems.  While not totally dead, the
output power was only perhaps 100 uW - so low I didn't even bother to
measure it.  Among the things that were wrong:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The pump laser diode had a lasing threshold of over 700 mA and a very low
 slope efficiency when tested on a lab controller.  This indicated that it was
 seriously damaged.
<p>
<li>The laser diode was running at 1.3 A and the Current pot had no
 effect.  So, there was an electronics problem with the driver circuit.
<p.
<li>The TEC for the laser diode had been disconnected.  But when re-attached,
 it was unable to maintain proper temperature control due to the excessive
 heating from the high pump current (though the TEC controller is functional
 and did try, but its current limit of about 1 A was totally insufficient).
 So, whoever disconnected the TEC probably thought it was faulty because it
 appeared to be heating instead of cooling.
<p>
<li>The MCA barrel itself was misaligned with improper orientation.  So,
 the polarization orientation of the output beam was incorrect and
 efficiency was reduced.
<p>
<li>Finally, the external beam sampling and collimating optics were filthy
 resulting in excessive scatter and reduced power in the useful beam.
</ul>
<p>
Aside from these trivial issues, the laser operated perfectly. :)  But it did
arrive in very good physical condition and these lasers are <i>really</i>
cute.  More details on this unit below.
<p>
Initial testing was with a 5 VDC power supply and the required interlock
plug.  That is when it was found to have low power and no response to the
current or power adjustments.  I then removed the DPSS module and the MCA
crystal assembly from it to test the pump diode on my lab controller.
As expected, the diode did work, but wouldn't even put out 50 mW of IR
at 1 A.  No wonder the green output was so weak.  Using an XYZ
micropositioner, I aligned and then re-attached the MCA barrel temporarily
with 5 minute Epoxy so that the DPSS module would work for testing at least.
The pump diode is bad and realignment will probably be needed when that is
replaced, but for now it will lase green.  On the lab controller, 5 mW of
green light could just barely be obtained at 1 A of pump current before the
diode overheated due to lack of adequate cooling.  At 1.3 A, it would
certainly have been much higher, but I was reluctant to drive the small TEC
at a high enough current to have any chance of maintaining a reasonable
temperature.
<p>
Since that high a current to the pump diode is clearly not normal for a
5 mW green laser, I assumed that was the reason the temperature control
wasn't working - the electronics were fine.  On the lab controller, it would
regulate the pump diode temperature with a maximum TEC current of 1 A at up to
about 600 mA of pump current, but the internal laser diode driver was
putting out 1.3 A and the Current pot had no effect on it.
<p>
After inspecting the electronics PCB and finding no obviously bad parts,
I began to suspect that the orange jumper wire running across it in the
photo wasn't original - all the other jumpers were green.  And in fact,
it connects between the Current pot and near a power transistor.  So, on
a hunch, I removed the orange jumper.  And, can you believe it,
the current regulator sprang to life with a range of near 0 mA to over
550 mA? ;-)  That would be perfect for a 200 to 500 mW laser diode,
which is what would make the most sense installed in this laser,
and would also be consistent with the pump diode current range
over which the TEC cooling would be effective.
<p>
What may have happened is that the previous owner attempted to
get more power out of the laser and the current limit was getting in the way.
What a bummer. :)  Or, perhaps the original pump diode degraded with use and
they replaced it with a 1 W diode.  In either case, the maximum current was
not adequate, so they tried to find a way to increase it.  The orange wire
did the trick but was overkill in more ways than one and probably mostly
destroyed the pump diode.  There is also evidence that the power transistor
near the tail end of the ornage wire had been replaced, so perhaps that
was the initiating event.
<p>
I eventually did get around to replacing the pump diode.  I had one that
was rated 500 mW, a threshold around 125 mW, Imax of 600 mA, and the same
package and pinout, which seemed to be perfect.  Getting the bad one out
was a real treat though requiring the use of drills, files, Xacto blades,
and assorted dental picks.  The result wasn't pretty but it was effective.
The replacement diode was installed and secured with silver Epoxy with the
same orientation.  The laser crystal assembly was mounted in a gripper
attached to an XYZ micropositioner to allow for precise alignment with
the pump beam.  The intention was to use 5 minute Epoxy to secure it
once the perfect position - clean TEM00 beam and maximum power - was
found.  The pump diode and TEC were driven using my ILX LDC-3900 during
alignment.
<p>
This actually worked quite well.  Or would have had I remembered to mark
the orientation of the laser module before removing it or at least had
checked the spec'd polarization for the laser output!  So, my first
attempt resulted in a wonderful beam with a low threshold and good slope
efficiency.  I had even gotten the temperature and laser diode current
adjusted on the laser itself.  But the polarization was at 90 degrees
to what it should have been!  Unfortunately, the output optics of this
laser includes a polarizing beam-splitter so nothing was coming out!
I could have removed the PBS and no one would know, but being a stickler
for details, I was determined to get this correct!  And in doing so,
accidentally dropped the laser module a couple inches onto my wooden
workbench when it popped free of the adhesive.  That caused
the optically contacted KTP to pop off the vanadate crystal, rendering the
laser module useless.  After a generous allotment of selected 4 letter
words, I briefly considered attempting to re-attach it but realized
that would be futile.  Aside from the total lack of anything approaching
a clean-room, there was no indication of the correct orientation for
the KTP, and it is soo small as to be virtually impossible to handle and
position.  So, the operation was a success but the patient died. :( :)
<p>
I have since acquired several working laser/optics assemblies for these
lasers, so a transplant is probably in this laser's future.

<h2>Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sclmghpd">Description of Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

Note: Maintenance information on these lasers has moved to the chapter:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strtoc">SS Laser Testing, Adjustment, Repair</A>.
These also include symptoms to look for in evaluating a surplus laser
of this type.
<p>
Melles Griot manufactures several DPSS lasers that qualify as high power,
at least for their wavelength - green (532 nm) lasers from 1 to 3 W and blue
(457 nm) lasers from 50 to 400 mW.  There are versions that are single
frequency, and blue lasers that output a dual beam (see the next section).
The original designs were developed by a company called Laser Power
Corporation, taken over by Melles Griot in 1999.  Thus, any lasers
with manufacturing dates before that may have just been old stock
with Melles Griot labels slapped on them!
<p>
The newer (Melles Griot manufactured) systems consist of a rather cool looking
laser head - sort of art deco styling - on a huge air-cooled heatsink, and
separate controller, which are a matched pair.  (Unless otherwise noted,
the newer systems are assumed in subsequent descriptions.)  Thus connecting
laser head "A" to controller "B" is likely to result in sub-optimal
performance and possibly even damage to the pump diode.  The operating
parameters are probably all stored in NVRAM as there don't seem to be
enough pots inside the controllers for them.  If you have a pile of these,
Melles Griot may be willing to tell you the serial numbers of the mating
pairs.
<p>
All variations look similar to the one shown in <A HREF="58bld-1.jpg">Melles
Griot 58-BLD-605 Dual Beam Blue DPSS Laser</A>.
(Photo courtesy of Corey Gray (corey@outbackequipment.com).)
Standard models can run in either constant current or constant power mode
though all of the samples I've seen (which were probably OEM versions) lacked
the monitor photodiode needed for constant power mode, so they only run
in constant current mode.
<p>
With just the laser head and controller, the system will only operate at
the default settings.  For older controllers like the 58-PSM-254, this is
always full power and cannot be changed in the field.  In fact, lasers using
these controllers probably cannot be run at much below rated power by design.
However, there is an analog interface on newer controllers like the
58-PSM-290 which provides for laser on/off, TTL modulation, and basic system
status.  And an RS232 port allows for these functions as well as a standby
mode at reduced power, setting of current or power to arbitrary values,
a neat programmable pulse mode, and monitoring of various parameters
like diode current and diode and cavity temperature.  For more information
on this family of lasers, go to the
<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> Web site,
then to "Lasers", "Diode Pumped Solid State".
<p>
The lasing medium for all models is Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate).
For green lasers, the fundamental wavelength
is 1,064 nm doubled to 532 nm.  For blue lasers, the fundamental wavelength
is 914 nm doubled to 457 nm.  There also used to be some IR models at 1,064
nm but they no longer appear on the Melles Griot Web site.  The pump is an
808 nm laser diode array (probably 10 to 30 W max depending on model) with
a cylindrical microlens for fast-axis beam correction close coupled to a
polarization maintaining fiber bundle/beam shaper.  For a 3 W 58-GSD-309
laser, I measured 12 watts of pump power (at 18 amps of diode current)
out of the beam shaper.  This is then focused into the vanadate crystal
with a short focal length lens. The pump diode array is replaceable in
principle, and diodes with the required specifications (19 emitters, 0.5 mm
spacing) are relatively common, but fast-axis beam correction (which may not
be available from the diode manufacturer) is essential, and alignment in the
laser is rather critical.
<p>
These are microchip lasers and the relatively large size of the laser head
can be deceiving.  Even the 3 W green models now use a vanadate crystal that's
only about 3x3x2mm with a total cavity length less than 25 mm!  (The vanadate
crystal in older versions was a bit larger - perhaps 5 mm on a side.)
While all use a discrete laser cavity, what else is inside the cavity
will depend on the specific version - single or multiple longitudinal
mode, single or dual beam, etc.  For dual beam models, an angled mirror
on the vanadate crystal or angled surface on the doubling crystal diverts
the backward traveling beam at a slight angle out of the laser.
<p>
Here are some photos of a typical 3 W dual beam green laser.
The exact model number of this particular laser is not known but it is
similar to the 58-GSD-309.

</ul>
<p>
The laser diode array is in the gold package
at the left, feeding the fiber-coupler/beam shaper in the aluminum box.  This
is followed by a lens focusing the beam into the vanadate (Nd:YVO4) crystal
just visible sandwiched between thin plates, likely made of sapphire or
undoped YAG to aid in heat removal.  The HR mirror is probably coated on
the rear surface of the backing plate so that the interface between the
vanadate and backing plate requires at most an index matching AR coating.
Ot, the difference in indices of refraction may be used to advantage in
implementing a weak etalon for mode selection.  Since this is a
dual beam laser, the backward-traveling green beam must be diverted out of the
cavity.  The plate on the right surface of the vanadate is wedged (clearly
visible in the second photo) and has a green-reflecting mirror coating for this
purpose.  The KTP is under the metal cover and the output coupler (OC)
mirror can just be seen at the far right, offset to allow the second beam
to bypass it entirely.  That beam is the one that is sampled by
the 45 degree plate for the monitor photodiode, which is present in this
laser.  Other versions of these lasers sends the second beam through the OC
which is transparent for the green wavelength.  Not visible in the photos
are a pair of large TECs under the LD assembly, and a large TEC
under the Xtal assembly.  There is also a thermistor to monitor laser head
baseplate temperature presumably to check for fan failure or excessive
(high or low) ambient temperature, though not all controllers appear to
monitor it.
<p>
<A HREF="mghpgdl4.jpg">Pump Diode Array in Melles Griot High Power DPSS
Laser</A> shows the diode running just above threshold with the fiber coupler/
beam shaper removed.  The 19 emitters are clearly visible (the one on the
very right end is a bit weak).  The white-ish purple color is a result
of the digital camera's response to high intensity 808 nm light.
<p>
The laser diode (LD) and laser cavity (Xtal) each have their temperature
controlled separately.  On most laser heads, the thermistor monitoring
Xtal temperature is in the laser cavity baseplate.  However, there may be
another thermistor glued into the actual KTP mount that is used instead, or
not connected to anything.
<p>
On newer laser heads, there is an O-ring seal all around.  And while at
first glance it might seem that the rear end is not well sealed (as I
originally thought), the connection between the cable compartment and
interior is via a pair of ribbon cables and the O-ring clamps down over
them fairly tightly.  However, it still may not be gas-tight.  Although
there was apparently a demo at some trade show where one of these lasers was
shown operating underwater in a fish tank, trying such a stunt with a
production laser might not be advisable.  I wonder if the fish were
wearing the proper laser safety goggles. :)
<p>
Really old laser heads may not be sealed at all other than by reasonably
close fitting metal parts, though one I saw had some mylar tape covering the
seams as a half-hearted attempt, which may not have been entirely effective.

Gallery</A> (Version 2.00 or higher) under "Melles Griot Diode Pumped Solid
State Lasers".
<p>
When considering purchasing one of these lasers surplus, here is the short list
of what to check:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Beam quality:</b> The beam or beam(s) should be round or elongated (sa
 listed in the specifications) but not "blobby" with at most only minimal
 ghost spots and the alignment should be within acceptable tolerances.
 Defects here could indicate potential problems with the laser cavity
 optics.
<p>
<li><b>Power output:</b> For a new (or low hours laser) the output power
 should be near or greater than the rated value when running at the factory
 set current in current mode, or near the rated value when run in light
 feedback (constant power) mode (if available).  However, pump power for
 a given pump diode current does decrease gradually with hours used so that a
 high mileage laser will likely produce less than rated output
 power at the original pump current in constant current mode.  Other
 possibilities include (1) the default pump current or output power was
 changed via the RS232 port on controllers with this feature, (2) the
 controller being used with the particular laser head is not the one
 intended to go with it, or (3) there is internal damage to the pump diode
 or laser cavity optics.  None of these is necessarily an indication of
 impending doom.  The laser could operate for a long time without any
 sudden change in behavior.
<p>
 If the laser uses a controller having an active RS232 port (PSM290 or later),
 using it to check operation would be desirable.  Pump diode current for
 rated power is typically in the 16 to 20 A range for new 3 W green lasers
 and 400 mW blue lasers (less for lower power lasers).
<p>
<li><b>Power stability:</b> In both current mode and light mode (if available),
 there should be no visible changes in output power after a warmup period of
 10 minutes or so.  Even in current mode, a laser power meter should not
 show more than a 5 percent or so fluctuation in output power after this,
 much less in light mode.
<p>
<li><b>The model number:</b> If it contains an "R" (as in 58-GSDR-309),
 the laser had been back to Melles Griot for evaluation.  It may have
 been repaired, or the repair may have been declined and the laser was
 simply returned unchanged.  Given the high cost of repair from Melles
 Griot, the latter is quite likely.  (I think the evaluation alone costs
 around $500!)  Many eBay lasers show up with the R. :)  Note that the
 lack of an "R" doesn't necessarily mean the laser <i>wasn't</i>
 tested by Melles Griot for a problem, only that the sticker was left
 unchanged!
</ul>
<p>
Auction listings for these lasers often provide the output power, which may
be very low compared to the specified ratings.  Be suspect of any claims that
it can easily be increased.  If there are no photos in the listing of the
actual beam(s) projected onto a screen, ask the seller to provide them to
determine the beam quality and alignment.  Insist on a reasonable warranty
especially if there is anything the least bit questionable.
<p>

<h3><A NAME="sclmgbld">Melles Griot Dual Beam Blue DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

It's a feature, not a bug!  The first reaction to seeing the output
of the 58-BLD-605 and other models in this series is that the laser must be
broken, as the output is a pair of beams - sort of like twin
coherent headlights. :)  Please see
<A HREF="58bld-1.jpg">Melles Griot 58-BLD-605 Dual Beam Blue DPSS Laser</A>.
One beam is aligned fairly close to the optical axis of the
laser head while the other shoots off at a 5 degree or so
angle to the left.  The output power of the two beams is roughly the same
and they are both vertically linearly polarized.  The 58-BLD-605 is rated
at 400 mW (total for both beams) and operates with single transverse mode
(TEM00) and single longitudinal mode (single frequency).  There are
lower power and multimode versions as well.
<p>
There used to be both green (532 nm) and blue (457 nm) versions of the
dual beam lasers but now, neither is listed on the
<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> Web site.
(The only high power DPSS lasers there now are single beam green.)
<p>
The implementation and rational for having two beams can be found in
<b>U.S. Patent #5,761,227: Efficient Frequency Converted Laser</b>.  In short,
there is a mirror inside the cavity that deflects the backward
traveling visible (doubled) beam so that it doesn't go through the
lasing medium but is sent out of the laser entirely.  The argument goes
that this avoids losses passing through the vanadate, interference
between the two beams that may be at some arbitrary phase with
respect to each-other, and destabilizing effects inside
the SHG crystal.  Other relevant patents include: #4,809,291: Diode Pumped
Laser and Doubling to Obtain Blue Light, #5,751,751: Deep Blue Microlaser,
#5,796,766: Optically Transparent Heat Sink for Longitudinally Cooling an
Element in a Laser, and #5,771,324: Polarization-Preserving Fiber Optic
Assembly.

<p>
Referring to the last photo:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pump focusing optics:</b> A pair of lenses in silver-colored
 holders focus the output of the pump fiber combiner (far right) into
 the vanadate crystal.
<p>
<li><b>Vanadate sandwich:</b> The actual gain medium is Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>
 (vanadate).   The High Reflector (HR) is coated on the rear surface of the
 vanadate crystal.  To handle up to 20 *WATTs* or more of pump power, the
 microchip sliver of vanadate (less than 1 mm thick) is optically contacted
 between two pieces of sapphire (probably, could be diamond though).  DO NOT
 TOUCH!!!  The bonding is very fragile.
<p>
<li><b>Dual beam mirror:</b> This optic reflects the backward-traveling
 blue beam back out at a slight angle to the main primary beam.  It passes
 back through the SHG crystal and OC mirror, but is not affected by them.
 The output power of the two beams is almost identical.
<p>
<li><b>SHG crystal:</b> The rectangular chunk of BBO (probably) is mounted
 in a copper heat sink.
<p>
<li><b>Output Coupler (OC):</b> This is a normal dielectric mirror in the
 silver-colored holder.
</ul>
<p>
Before you ask why anyone would want such a strange laser, consider that
for applications like interferometry and holography, the first thing that
is required is to split the the beam of a "normal" single beam laser into 2
or more parts.  So, in those cases, some of the work has already been
done.  Since the two beams are mutually coherent, the result is essentially
equivalent to an external beamsplitter but with the advantages cited above.
<p>
It's easy to focus the two beams to one spot, but where a single beam is
required, an option (58-ACB-001) is available to optically combine the two
beams into one beam.  But I could not find any specifications for it except
that the result is a larger beam and lower divergence (by a factor of four).
If the method is similar to the one described in the patent, a 1/2 wave
waveplate rotates the polarization of one of the beams by 90 degrees so
they can be combined using a polarizing beamsplitter.  The patent states
that the result is then two co-linear beams with orthogonal polarizations
and that this should not pose a problem for many applications.  Hmmmm.
However, it would appear that the unavoidable result is *not* really two
independent co-linear beams with orthogonal polarization, but a single
beam with arbitrary polarization, which would be linear polarization if
their phase difference is 0 or 180 degrees, circular polarization if
their phase difference is +/-90 degrees, or some amount of elliptical
polarization for phase differences in between.  And since the phase
difference depends on the path length difference - and this can vary
with temperature - the result may not be either specified or constant.
Thus while the output power in the combined beam will be the sum of that in
the separate two beams, the polarization could be anything.  Where an AOM
(Acousto-Optic Modulator) or PCAOM (PolyChromatic AOM) or other
polarization sensitive component or application is involved, this
could be a problem.
<p>
The cost for a new 58-BLD-605 from Melles Griot is around $29,000 and you
can order on-line. :)  A few of these lasers have been showing up on eBay
but typically, their output power does not meet specifications ranging
from weak (e.g., 100 mW) to very weak (e.g., 25 mW or less).  This
may be due to bad pump diodes or some other problem, though it's conceivable
the controller had been set up for lower default power (parameters stored in
non-volatile memory).  Now, 100 mW of blue light isn't bad, but without
knowing the cause, there is no way to estimate the life expectancy, and it
could be short.  It's also possible that the controller is not matched
to the laser head, a requirement for these systems.  On similar green
lasers, a mismatch could result in only 50 percent of the rated power.
On blue ones, it may be much worse because the temperatures are much more
critical.  If you have a laser that lacks power
and don't know if it is matched to the controller, see the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpat">Adjustment of Temperature Setpoints in Melles
Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A>.
<p>
WARNING: The 457 nm photons are a very pretty shade of blue but keep in
mind that the eye's sensitivity at this wavelength is only about
1/4 that of a red 632.8 nm HeNe laser, 1/16th that of a 532 nm green DPSS
laser, and 1/18th that of the 555 nm peak.  Thus the
relatively unimpressive brightness of one of these lasers even
operating at the full 400 mW can be dangerously deceptive!  A foot away,
unfocused, it will burn your hand almost instantly, let alone your eyes!

<h3><A NAME="sclmghpc">Controllers for Melles Griot High Power DPSS
 Lasers</A></h3>

The power supply units (controllers) that come with these lasers usually
have 58 (or 85) -PSM model designations.  While the newer versions
include an RS232 port and some other features not present on models derived
from the original Laser Power Corporation designs, they are all fairly similar
as far as the power electronics are concerned.
<p>
Unlike some other lasers like the Coherent Compass-M series, where the
controller reads personality information from the laser head, these Melles
Griot lasers require that the laser head and controller be matched
sets.  If this is not the case, output power may not be correct (usually
lower but the other way around is possible if the pump current is greater),
particularly for blue lasers where the temperature settings are much more
critical.  But I've seen a power reduction of almost 50 percent
in a green laser where the incorrect controller serial number was used,
a result of the pump diode (LD) and laser cavity (Xtal) temperature setpoints
being incorrect.  The LD temperature tunes the pump wavelength which
must be set close to 808 nm for optimal absorption in the vanadate.
The Xtal temperature adjusts for optimal phase matching in the
doubler crystal.  Both of these are even more critical in the blue lasers
and will likely have a much more dramatic effect on output power if not
exactly correct.
<p>
I don't believe that damage would result if controllers for lasers having
similar specifications were substituted (e.g., various 3 W green lasers.
However, if a controller for one type of laser were used with a different type
or lower power laser head, the current limit for the laser diode could
be exceeded.  Thus, where you've inherited a truckload of these things without
documentation, it would be worth contacting Melles Griot to find out how they
are supposed to go together. :)
<p>
The laser diode (LD) current, laser diode temperature, and laser cavity (Xtal)
temperature have separate control loops and may be tested independently as
long as the controller is in constant current mode.  The default settings
are likely stored in NVRAM at the factory.  For older controllers, there
appears to be no way to alter any of them via any user accessible means.
For newer controllers, the operating and idle pump diode current may be
adjusted via the RS232 port, and saved as the default when the laser is
powered up.
<p>
Functionally, the controllers consist of a single large switchmode power
supply to drop the AC line voltage to an intermediate DC voltage ("B+",
18 VDC on the 58-PSM-254 I measured), which is distributed to the pulse
width drivers for each of the control loops.
<p>
Constructing a home-built controller for these lasers is straightforward in
principle, though relatively high currents are required (up to 30 A for the
laser diode and probably 10 or 20 A for the LD TEC, somewhat less for the
Xtal TEC). However, there are no fancy search algorithms or adaptive logic,
just three fixed setpoints.

<h3>Lightwave Electronics 110 IR Q-Switched DPSS Laser</A></h3>

The LWE-110 is a diode pumped solid state laser with an active (RF)
Q-switch.  They have a compact laser head with a separate controller
box.  All the smarts are in the controller including the laser diode
and TEC driver, and Q-switch driver.  Newer versions (HD26 head
connector) have a personality EEPROM in the laser head so it's not
necessary to match a laser head to a specific controller.  Older versions
(round LIMO head connector) require a head personality module to be installed
in the controller.
<p>
There are versions of the LWE-110 laser head using Nd:YVO4 (1,064 or
1,342 nm), Nd:YAG (1,064 nm or 1,320 nm), and Nd:YLF (1,047 nm), and
possibly others including 532 nm (frequency doubled).  The maximum
output power ranges from 50 mW to over 500 mW depending on model.
<p>
The LWE-110 can be run from the front panel or RS232.
On the LWE-110 I tested, there was no response from the RS232 port,
though wiring was confirmed to be correct - both pins 2 and 3
were active.  But it came from an ESI laser trimming system and
may have been modified.  The terminal compatibility and protocol should
be similar to that of the LWE-142, LWE-221, and other Lightwave lasers.
<p>
Using the front panel controls, it's possible to select CW, Free Run
(Q-switched), Triggered (Q-switched), and a couple more obscure modes.  There
are also one or two other parameters that have subtle effects on behavior,
but NOT pump power or current, or temperature.  The laser always runs
at maximum power unless a voltage is applied to the "Suppress Output"
BNC.  Then, it's possible to reduce the CW output power (but not
increase it).
<p>
The Q-switch free run frequency can range from 1 Hz to 50 kHz or 100 kHz
depending on specific model.  And the typical average output power when
running Q-switched tops out at 80 or 90 percent of the CW power.
<p>
WARNING: There may be no delay from exiting Standby Mode to laser output.
All these wavelengths are totally invisible and thus extra dangerous at
the power levels available.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe125d">Lightwave Electronics 125/126 IR DPSS Laser</A></h3>

The LWE-125 and LWE-126 are high quality single frequency IR (1,064 or 1,319
nm) DPSS lasers based on the same NPRO technology as the LWE-142
described in the following sections.  (I suggest readings those first if
not familiar with the NPRO concept.)  The difference between the two is
that the LWE-125 is fiber-coupled while the LWE-126 is free-space.
(I'll use LWE-125 designation for both models unless there is a need
to differentiate between them.)  Unfortunately, the fiber in the
LWE-125 is not removable by the user. So, a damaged fiber or connector
renders the laser useless unless the fiber is repaired.  Being strictly
IR, these lasers are much simpler than the LWE-142,
lacking the resonant doubler and all its associated optics,
control electronics, and firmware.  The LWE-125 laser head looks
similar to the LWE-142, but is slightly smaller.  All that's required
to run the LWE-125 laser are +/-5 VDC power supplies that plug in via
a Neutrik NC4FX-B connector.  Like the LWE-142,
the LWE-125 may be controlled via an RS232 port, but there is a fancy
control box available which includes the DC power supplies.  However,
the control box has relatively limited functionality.  It can switch
between STANDBY and OPERATE modes, turn the pump diode on and off, and
adjust output power and NPRO temperature.  But while things like the
pump diode temperature can be monitored, they cannot be changed.  This
is annoying. :) However, for normal operation, setting the laser up
via the RS232 port and then using it as a turn-key system should suffice.
Like the LWE-142, there are inputs for fast and slow tuning which
control the PZT and temperature of the NPRO, respectively.

Note that there are some "fake" LWE-125s that have been for sale on eBay
and elsewhere.  The model number is 125-1313-30 with an output wavelength
of 1,313 nm.  They appear to be normal in every respect with exactly the
same case, DC power requirements, and the power connector.  However, they
are NOT NPRO lasers, but have conventional Fabry-Perot linear cavity with
a microchip gain medium.  And, they are not even single longitudinal mode.
These were apparently an OEM product for one customer.  I've even seen the
work orders for modifying a normal LWE-125 during manufacture! :)  One way
to test would probably be to use a compass to check for a magnet inside,
only present with an NPRO laser.
<p>
CAUTION: If you have one of these lasers and are curious to look inside the
sealed optics box, take great care as the most of the guts come off with the
cover, but the fiber cable stays in the base.  So, pulling on it will break
the fiber.  I managed to avoid that, just barely. :)

 Sub-Table of Contents</A>.
<h3><A NAME="scllwe142d">Lightwave Electronics 142 Green DPSS Laser</A></h3>

The LWE-142 is a high quality single frequency green (532 nm) DPSS laser
based on a very elegant but unusual design.  This laser was developed
by Lightwave Electronics, now a part of JDS Uniphase.
Go to <A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A>, "Product Categories:
Commercial Lasers", "Solid State Lasers", "Laser, Solid-State, CW, 532
(NPRO 142)".
<p>
Three things differentiate the LWE-142 from other lasers in the same power
class:
<p>
<ol>
<li>A <i>monolithic</i> NonPlanar Ring Oscillator (NPRO) at the fundamental
 frequency of 1,064 nm.  The NPRO is inherently single frequency (single
 longitudinal mode), has very low noise and narrow linewidth, and is very
 robust with no chance of changes in internal alignment, or contamination
 of intracavity optics.
<p>
<li>An external <i>monolithic</i> resonant frequency doubler to obtain 532 nm.
 Most of the desirable characteristics of the NPRO are preserved in the
 doubling process.  The doubler possesses the same immunity to misalignment
 and contamination.
<p>
<li>A control algorithm in firmware to identify and lock the lasing mode
 to a longitudinal (axial) doubler mode and maintain constant power.
</ol>
<p>
The heart of the LWE-142 is the NPRO, fabricated from a single (monolithic)
Nd:YAG crystal.  (The original acronym was "MISER"
standing for: Monolithic Isolated Single-mode End-pumped Ring, but NPRO seems
to have become more popular.)  The NPRO crystal
is cut in a very specific way that results in the intracavity beam not
bouncing around in a single plane inside the crystal as would be
the case in a conventional ring laser.  This is shown in
<A HREF="npro1.gif">NonPlanar Ring Oscillator (NPRO) Geometry</A>.  In the
diagram, the beam path is from the front (curved) surface, to the angled
surface on the far right, up to the top surface, down to the angled surface
on the far left, and back to the front surface, which accepts the pump
beam, serves as the output coupler for the laser beam, and acts as a
weak polarizer in reflection for the intracavity beam.  All but the
input/output surface are planar and angled for total internal reflection so
losses are very close to zero.
<p>
The nonplanar geometry results in a polarization rotation as the beam travels
around the ring path, similar to what would be introduced by a 1/2 wave
waveplate at a slight angle.  A magnetic field along the optical axis of
the long legs of the ring (not shown) provides an opposite shift (via
the Faraday effect) but is direction dependent so that it partially
cancels the polarization rotation in one direction
but adds to it in the other direction.  This results in
low losses for a beam traveling in only one direction and unidirectional lasing
free of spatial hole burning effects that could result in multi-longitudinal
mode (non-single frequency) operation is assured up to relatively high
output power.  The curved front mirror provides a stable cavity configuration
and since the intracavity beam hits the mirror at a substantial angle,
there is also a significant polarization preference dependent reflectance.
Thus, the three components that form an "optical diode" in a conventional
unidirectional ring laser are present in the NPRO: polarization rotation
by the geometry of the NPRO surfaces, canceling of the polarization rotation
by the Faraday effect in one direction, and a polarization preference at the
curved mirror.
<p>
See:
<A HREF="http://www.rp-photonics.com/nonplanar_ring_oscillators.html">Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - Nonplanar Ring
Oscillators</A> for some more info on the NPRO laser design.
<p>
A variety of slightly different geometries are also possible
and have some advantages.  In fact, the LWE NPRO lasers use a slight
modification of <A HREF="npro1.gif">NonPlanar Ring Oscillator (NPRO)
Geometry</A> which causes the second reflection of the intracavity beam (point
3) to be off of an additional angled surface at the far end of the crystal
instead of the top surface.  This results in a smaller out-of-plane offset
in the path and a corresponding reduction in the required magnetic field.
<p>
In the LWE-142, the output of the NPRO is at 1,064 nm with a single frequency
and single spatial mode (TEM00).  This feeds a separate resonant frequency
doubler - outside the cavity, unlike virtually all other CW green lasers.
It is also a monolithic design, cut from a single piece of magnesium doped
lithium niobate (MgO:LiNbO3), but with a somewhat simpler ring geometry
than the NPRO since an out-of-plane beam path is not required or desired.
The doubler has only 3 reflecting surfaces, with total internal reflection for
the 2 planar surface and a mirror coating for the curved input/output surface.
The LiNbO3 is phased matched for 532 nm with that mirror coating
selected to maximize intracavity resonant 1,064 nm power while permitting
most of the 532 nm beam to escape.  As with the NPRO, the ring geometry
provides the benefit of the input and output beams being at around 90
degrees to one-another eliminating the need to separate the input and
output beams, as well as minimizing back-reflection.  Since the doubler
is also a unidirectional ring, there is no wasted backward traveling green
beam either.
<p>
Decoupling the fundamental and harmonic generation processes has advantages
since each one can be optimized independently.  Most of the desirable
characteristics of the monolithic NPRO laser are preserved after
doubling including the narrow line-width and low noise resulting in a
super coherence length, estimated to be greater than 1,000 meters.
(It's extremely difficult to measure such a long coherence length!)
<p>
Also, as a practical matter with both the NPRO and doubler being monolithic,
optics cleaning is almost a non-issue since all surfaces that need to have
low losses are internal to the NPRO and doubler crystals and they
can't get dirty.  Only optics in the external beam paths are subject
to contamination, which will have a much reduced effect on performance.
Even a scratch or speck of dust on an optic will only reduce power
very slightly, not kill the lasing process entirely.
And, any cleaning that may be needed is less risky and even a scratch or
speck of dust on an optic may slightly reduce output power, but won't kill
the lasing process entirely.  The quality of these optics doesn't need to
be quite as high as those inside an optical cavity, so their cost can be
lower.  However, the cost of the strangely shaped NPRO and doubler is
probably much higher than for common laser crystal shapes.  And though
not as critical as alignment inside a laser cavity, the relative alignmnet
between the NPRO and doubler still has a significant impact on performance.
There are always tradeoffs!
<p>
However, precise control is required to lock the lasing line of the NPRO and
the resonance of the doubler together.  This involves precise temperature
control of the pump diode, NPRO crystal, and doubler crystal, and
a sophisticated algorithm to match the lasing and doubler modes and
then lock them together with a feedback loop implemented in firmware.  This
also provides some entertainment as the laser is warming up. :)
<p>
The laser head itself includes all of the driver electronics with the
microprocessor based controller.  Only DC voltages need to be supplied
externally.  Control of the firmware parameters for testing and fine tuning is
via an RS232 interface to a PC or terminal emulator.  But for normal
operation, it's usually just a matter of applying power.
<p>
Similar Lightwave/Uhiphase lasers using NPROs are also available with outputs
at 1,064 nm and 1,319 nm, another Nd:YAG line (NPRO-125/126).  Since there
is no doubler in these lasers, their design is considerably simpler.
There is also a low power 1,064 nm version with additional locking electronics
specifically for injection seeding (NPRO-101).
<p>
Like other high quality single frequency lasers such as the Coherent Compass-M
series, internal amplitude modulation (via an electronic input) isn't possible
with the LWE-142.  Changing the output power involves the firmware and
typically takes a several seconds or longer.  However, slow wavelength
tuning over a few GHz is possible via an electrical input adjusting the
Nd:YAG crystal temperature.  And somewhat faster piezo-electric tuning
over a few MHz is also implemented.  But, even "fast" is not very fast
to avoid losing lock.  I don't know whether it's possible to lock two
randomly selected LWE-142 lasers together with a difference of 0 Hz.
There used to be an option for selection and/or factory
adjustment of an LWE-142 so that at least one of the doubler modes
is an iodine absorption line, useful for spectroscopy and related
applications.  Another version that is no longer made had outputs for
both 1,064 nm and 532 nm.
<p>
Here are some of the most relevant patents.
<p>
The patent covering the original NPRO is:

<ul>
<li><b>U.S. Patent #4,578,793: Solid-state non-planar internally reflecting

 describing techniques close to those used in the LWE-142, and the authors
 were from Lightwave Electronics.

All in all, the NPRO approach is rather cool. :)

<p>
As for prices, if you have to ask, forget it! :)  In 1996, the list price for
a 100 mW LWE-142 was $23,500 and 200 mW was $33,500.  They have come
down somewhat since then.  The dual wavelength (20 mW at 1,064 nm and 70 mW
at 532 nm standard) was $4,150 extra (but is now no longer offered.
<p>
Prior to the LWE-142, there was a Model 140.  It had identical specs to the
single wavelength 532 nm version of the LWE-142.
The LWE-142 just put the controller electronics inside the head while the
LWE-140 had a separate box with the DC power supplies and controller.  So,
if you find an old LWE-140 head and supply, and replace the pump diode with
a healthy bright new one, you will really have a wonderful laser pet where
you can adjust all the parameters including the doubler oven and current with
the microprocessor in the power supply and digital display!  Nice.  Buy two and
make me one please, and an order of fries on the side with extra ketchup and
napkins!  Salivate, drool, drool.  The list price is entertaining also:
For 10 mW of green: $14,950, where 100 mW was $28,500!  And they did offer
a temperature controlled base option for a mere $2,450 extra with which
the laser might actually lock on alternate Tuesdays if it was nice outside
and you were lucky.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142c">LWE-142 Power, Control, and Cooling</A></h3>

To operate a Lightwave Model 142 laser that is known to be functional
requires only three DC voltages and proper cooling.  However,
if it is desired to remotely turn the laser on and off, monitor its lasing
status, or provide fine frequency tuning capability, a few additional
connections will be required.  Where adjustment or monitoring of additional
parameters is needed to diagnose or correct problems, the RS232 interface
described in the next section must be used.
<p>
My LWE-142 with custom power supply box and state-of-the-art laptop :) running
a terminal emulator is shown in
<A HREF="lwe142p1.jpg">Photo of Sam's LWE-142 Test Setup</A>.  Note the
large heatsink plate and fan.  Cooling is critical to the health of the
LWE-142 and may help to improve stability as well.
<p>
<b>Power supply connections</b>
<p>
The DB15 connector on the rear of the laser head is clearly labeled with
power supply voltages and signals but here is a listing, along with additional
comments:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pins 1,2,3: +5 VDC (4.0 A maximum).
<p>
<li>Pins 4,5: +12 VDC (3.0 A maximum).
<p>
<li>Pins 6,7,8: Ground (Power common).
<p>
<li>Pins 9,10: -12 VDC (0.5 A maximum).
</ul>
<p>
The tolerance for all DC voltages is +/-5%.  An inexpensive multiple output
switchmode power supply is acceptable as long as its current ratings are
adequate.  Since the current may be rather high, use individual #18 AWG
or larger wires for each pin all the way back to the power supply.
Double check your wiring and DO NOT change connections with power on!
<p>
<b>Lasing status, remote on/off, and tuning connections</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pin 11: ON, Lase Status.  HIGH when the pump diode is on.  Note:
 Despite what the manual says, this may not be a TTL signal and it should
 not be used to drive any circuitry with less than a 15K ohm input impedance.
<p>
<li>Pin 12: LASE, External Enable.  When driven high or floating, the laser
 will power up and produce a beam without any additional control.  Pulling
 LASE to ground will turn it off instantly.  The laser remains in a state
 that is equivalent to just after the initial 5 minute warmup.  It will
 restart and go through the locking process instantly when LASE is released
 from ground.
<p>
<li>Pin 13: N/C, Fast Frequency Tuning.  I'm not sure whether N/C means "NPRO
 Control" or "No Connection" - with this being an afterthought!  (Apparently,
 the fast frequency tuning function is not implemented on more recent versions
 of the Model 142 laser so then, it is a no connection!)
 N/C can be used to adjust the frequency of the NPRO, and thus the
 doubled 532 nm emission, via a piezoelectric element attached to the Nd:YAG
 crystal.  This provides a relatively fast tuning rate (compared to pin 14,
 below) but with a more limited excursion.  The input range is +/-1 V with
 and input impedance of 20k ohms and a nominal tuning sensitivity of 20 MHz/V.
 The bandwidth of the input is approximately 1 kHz.
<p>
 Attempting to change the frequency by more than 1 MHz in 1 second
 will likely cause the laser to lose lock and interrupt green emission,
 reinitiating the locking process.  The maximum rate of change should be
 limited to 100 mV per second.
<p>
 CAUTION: Applying more than +/-10 V to this input may damage the piezo
 input.
<p>
 If N/C is not used, to minimize noise pickup, pin 13 should be connected to
 pin 15 (RET) either directly or through a 50 ohm resistor.
<p>
<li>Pin 14: ADJ, Slow (or Broad) Frequency Tuning.  A voltage of up to +/-10 V
 may be applied to this input to shift the NPRO frequency, and thus the 532 nm
 emission.  The input impedance is 10k ohms and the tuning sensitivity
 is approximately 1 GHz/V at 1,064 nm and thus 2 GHz/V at 532 nm.
 However, as the frequency is tuned, the doubler efficiency decreases.
 For the description of this signal in the manual, it says the green output
 power will be reduced by approximately half when tuned by 2 GHz but in the
 list of specifications, it says 10 GHz.
<p>
 If the input is subjected to a step function, lock will likely be lost,
 so the maximum sweep rate should be limited to 100 mV per second.
<p>
<li>Pin 15: RET, Frequency Return.
<p>
 CAUTION: This signal is NOT the same as Power Common and should only be
 used as the return for the tuning signals on pins 13 and 14.
</ul>
<p>
It is not entirely clear what either of the frequency tuning signals actually
does or how the laser behaves, particularly why (or if) the locking firmware
doesn't try to correct for the reduction in output power due to the frequency
change.  There is a hint in the manual that the slow tuning input also shifts
the temperature of the doubler so that it tracks the NPRO.  This would explain
why the doubler efficiency always goes down (assuming it was optimal to begin
with), but not why the locking isn't affected.
<p>
<b>Status LEDs</b>
<p>
There are two LEDs on the rear of the laser head which provide a general
idea of what's going on:
<p>
<PRE>
   Red Power LED   Amber Status LED      Laser Condition
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
        Off              Off           Off or Standby (LASE low)
        Off           Slow Blink       Warming up
         On           Slow Blink       Warming up, but lasing
                                        (pump diode on, green
                                        output may be present)
         On          Medium Blink      Locking
         On               On           Locked, fully operational
        Off           Fast Blink       Fault detected
</PRE>
<p>
I have no idea why the red LED is called "Power".  A more appropriate name
would be "Emission".
<p>
<b>Cooling requirements</b>
<p>
Adequate cooling is absolutely critical to the performance and health of
these lasers.  Although, there is a sensor inside to shut down the laser
if the outer baseplate gets too hot, it has been known to activate too late.
The result was that the particular laser was never able to achieve the same
output power as before the "event" due possibly to the pump diode suffering
damage.  Don't let this happen to your LWE-142!
<p>
There are actually 2 surfaces that need to be cooled: These are the plates
on the bottom and one side.  The bottom surface has a typical heat dissipation
of 20 W (50 W max); the side plate has a typical heat dissipation of 10 W
(20 W max).  Of the two, the bottom one is more critical since it is where
the pump diode TEC dumps its heat while the side has the driver transistors.
A sufficiently large aluminum or copper heatsink should be provided for the
bottom surface.  Unless the surfaces are absolutely flat and smooth,
indium foil or thermal grease should be used between the laser
and heatsink.  The side surface can be force-air cooled or have its own
heatsink.  A fan blowing over the entire rig is desirable.  Cooling is
inadequate if after a few minutes of operation, the temperature of any
part of the laser case is more than just detectably warm by feel.  The
thermal resistance between the laser and the heatsink(s) is too high if
the laser is more than 3 &deg;C above the temperature of the heatsink(s).  A
steel optical table does NOT make an adequate heatsink despite its size
due to the poor thermal conductivity of steel.  In your eagerness to
power up the laser, do not overlook cooling!
<p>
To improve stability, it may even be desirable to put the entire laser on
a large TEC which maintains the bottom plate at a constant temperature
near 25 &deg;C..

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142i">LWE-142 Operation Using the RS232 Interface</A></h3>

The following is based on information from the Lightwave operation manual
for the Model 142 series green (532 nm) Nd:YAG NPRO laser, henceforth
referred to as the "Model 142" or "LWE-142"), and from my experience
with a specific unit.
<p>
<b>Laser Serial Interface</b>
<p>
The Model 142 can communicate through RS232 protocol on a DB9 female connector
at the edge of the power supply control PCB.  This connector has the same
pinout as the IBM PC.  The serial interface can be used for the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>In manufacturing to assist calibration.
<li>For field service with a terminal or PC.
<li>For field service via a modem.
<li>For host computer status and control.
<li>For remote operation of the laser.
</ol>
<p>
Under normal conditions, there isn't any need to use the RS232 interface
at all as the laser should power up and lock to the stored power setting
automagically.  However, the RS232 interface is the only way to evaluate
a misbehaving laser or to set the output power to a different value.
But what fun is a laser if no fiddling is possible!  So, another item on the
list above should be: "For entertainment on a lazy Saturday night". :)
However, at the very least, it would be highly desirable to run the laser
at least once using the RS232 interface so that its entire "state" - the
values of all parameters - can be saved to a file.  Then, they would be
available for reference should the laser's behavior change in the future.
<p>
<b>Hardware and Hookups</b>
<p>
The DB9F RS232 connector on the rear of the laser head can be connected to a
serial port on a terminal, modem, or host computer.
<p>
This connector on the terminal, modem, or host computer is usually a 9 or 25
pin standard D-shell type.  On a terminal, the connector is usually labeled
"Modem".  On a PC, it is labeled "Serial Port".  The functions of the pins
used by the LWE-142 laser are given as:
<p>
<PRE>
    Pin        Symbol        Function
  -------------------------------------------------------------
     2          /RxD         Received Data (into Model 142)
     3          /TxD         Transmitted Data (from Model 142)
     5          /Gnd         Ground
</PRE>
<p>
The DB9F RS232 connector on the rear of the laser head needs to be
connected to what is usually a 9 pin or 25 pin connector on the terminal or PC.
Note that pins 2 and 3 must be swapped between the Model 142 and PC.  A normal
RS232 extension cable will NOT work!  Once connected and powered up, double
check that this is correct by measuring the voltage between pin 5 (Gnd) and
pins 2 and 3 - they should both have a negative voltage on them of 6 volts
or more.  If one is close to 0 V, the swap isn't present or the wiring is
incorrect in some other way.
<p>
<b>Communications Settings</b>
<p>
The following settings are needed for proper communications:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Baud rate: 9600.
<li>Parity: None.
<li>Data bits: 8.
<li>Stop bits: 1.
<li>Duplex: Full.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Screen Control</b>
<p>
Control of the LWE-142 is via several screens using a terminal or terminal
emulator.  The laser sends information in a format compatible
with the Lear Siegler ADM-3A and Televideo 912 terminal.  Any terminal or
terminal emulator can be used that is compatible with these cursor controls.
(e.g., Televideo 925).  When using a terminal emulator on a PC, suitable
software will be needed.  Two options known to work are "Crosstalk
Communicator" and "Procomm Plus".  An ancient version of PCPLUS may be
downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lwe221/pcplus.zip">PCPLUS.ZIP</A>.  It
will run on any PC under DOS or in a DOS window under Win3.x/95/98, but
hung trying to run on WinME and WIN2000.  The fact that it's a 1988 DOS
program can't be an excuse to misbehave, can it? :)
<p>
When first powered up, laser sends out some
information as it performs its initialization which appears on
the status line at the bottom of the screen, but apparently only if the
terminal emulation is just right.  Only with the ADM5 on my version of
PCPLUS does it appear.  I never noticed it with the Televideo 925, but
perhaps I just never paid attention to the status line.  So there may still
be compatibility issues.
<p>
<ul>
<li>"LWE-142" (5 seconds).
<li>"Begin" (1 second).
<li>"5 minute" (1 second).
<li>"Warmup" (1 second).
<li>"Wait 4.0, 3.9,3.8,,,0.2,0.1 (each 6 seconds).
<li>"Wait 1.0, 0.9,0.8,,,0.2,0.1 (each 6 seconds).
</ul>
<p>
Pressing any key while "LWE-142" is on the screen will cause the laser to
send the release data of its firmware.
The initial warmup takes slightly over 4 minutes.  After the first Wait
countdown, the pump diode (and red LED) comes on and depending on how
cooperative the laser is, locking will require up to several minutes more.
<p>
Note that sending any character to the laser via the RS232 port after the
first 5 seconds will immediately turn on the pump diode and begin the
locking process.  It is best to wait until the laser does this on its
own.  To avoid annoying the laser, have the terminal emulator already
running before applying power to the laser, or start it only after the
pump diode is on.  PCPLUS, at least, apparently sends something out on
the RS232 line when it starts.  This will also allow the startup
information to be seen.
<p>
<b>Main laser parameters</b>
<p>
An "S" requests a display of the main laser parameters screen.  The screen
will be updated continuously after pressing "S".
Your actual display of this and the other screens described below
will depend on the firmware revision and may be quite different.
The displayed parameters appear on the right side after the description
but cannot be changed unless a password is given to enable adjustment mode.
(Some revisions of the firmware - others come up in protected mode without
any password.)  As soon as the last character of the password is entered,
the adjustment commands and additional screen options (see below) will
appear on the screen.
<p>
IMPORTANT: Since there doesn't appear to be any way to restore the factory
defaults (or present ettings), before even thinking about changing any
parameters in password protected mode, record all the information on this
screen as well as the other screens described below.  If using a terminal
emulator like PCPLUS, there will be a "screen snapshot" command to append
the complete screen to an ASCII file.  Else, in Windows, the "Print Screen"
key on your keyboard might work to save an image of the screen to the
clipboard, which can then be pasted to a file.  Or, use a graphics program
like IrfanView or Lviewp to capture the screen.  As a last resort, take a
photo of the monitor or record them with pencil and paper!

<p>
(The parameters above Screen Update on the upper right, and the save/change
options do not appear without entering the password.)
<p>
Here are descriptions of the major parameters:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Diode Temp Read:</b> This is the actual temperature of the pump diode.
 Due to what Lightwave calls a "non-linearity" in the temperature control,
 it may not agree with the "Laser Diode Setpoint".  On my laser, it is
 several &deg;C in error when set to around 16 &deg;C as shown in the screen
 shot above but quite close at 13 &deg;C.
<p>
<li><b>Crystal Temp Read:</b> This is the actual temperature of the NPRO
 crystal.  It should be possible to match this to the crystal temperature
 value in hexadecimal.
<p>
<li><b>Doubler Oven Temp:</b> This the actual temperature of the frequency
 doubler.  Its setpoint is adjusted via an internal pot and cannot be changed
 by firmware.  I don't think this temperature should change at any time.
<p>
<li><b>Diode Current:</b> This is the actual pump diode current and should
 either be 0.00 A or a constant value (2.60 A in this case).  It, too, is
 set by an internal pot and cannot be changed via firmware.
<p>
<li><b>Diode Photo Mon:</b> This is supposed to be the sensed output power of
 the pump diode.  On the LWE-142 lasers I have information on or have tested,
 it usually reads as a somewhat random number - either very small or 0.00 V,
 or 5.00 V, and is essentially useless.  I'd guess that the
 photodiode was never installed and the A/D input is floating.  Perhaps,
 it works on other versions of the laser.
<p>
<li><b>Crystal Photo Mon:</b> This is the sensed output of the NPRO crystal
 at 1,064 nm.  It will vary as a function of pump diode temperature and also
 how close the actual NPRO wavelength is to the center of the Nd:YAG gain
 curve.  Adjusting "Diode Temp Setpoint" to maximize this value should result
 in maximum possible green power.
</ul>
<p>
The Up and Down Arrow keys move the cursor between those parameters that can be
changed.  Even with the password, these are only the Diode Temp Setpoint,
Lock Reference Temp, and Screen Update enable.  All the others are simply
readouts and in particular, the Diode Current and Doubler Oven Temp cannot
be changed via the RS232 interface at all.  (They may in fact be internal
pots.)  For the Lock Reference Temp (where the cursor is in the
screenshot above), "K", "+", and ">" will increment by 1, 10, and 100,
"J", "-", and "&lt;<" will decrement by 1, 10, and 100.  For Diode Temp
Setpoint, only "J" and "K" are active.
<p>
Note that when the locking algorithm is active, it will fight any change
to the Lock Reference Temp, so just be persistent.  More on that later.
<p>
It shouldn't be possible to set the Diode Temp Setpoint to a value that
will damage the diode, but as a general recommendation, it's probably not
a good idea to go below 10 &deg;C or above 30 &deg;C even if the firmware
will allow it.

<p>
This is the primary screen for interacting with the laser locking algorithm.
Specific parameter values may differ depending on the actual laser.
Those starting in "$" are 16 bit hexadecimal numbers.  You do remember
hexadecimal from Computers 101??? :)  I suppose there are two possible
explanations as to why some parameters are displayed in decimal and others
in hexadecimal: (1) It's faster to convert from bits to a hexadecimal
display than from bits to a decimal display or (2) there was more than one
programmer involved.  I'll take the latter. :-)  The fact that
the large increment/decrement keys differ for the screens sort of
adds confirmation.
<p>
The following are the descriptions for each of the parameters on the "G"
screen from the LWE-142 user manual, followed by additional comments or
clarifications based on my observations.
<p>
The first 4 parameters are all decimal numbers.
<ul>
<li><b>Green Pwr:</b> This is an 8 bit representation (0 to 255) of the
 actual 532 nm output power.  The scale is arbitrary but is monotonic and
 typically linear to within 10 percent.
<p>
 From what I've seen, this readout is quite precise.  I trust it more than
 an external power meter for accuracy and speed of response.
<p>
 On my LWE-142, Green Pwr is just about half the actual power.  On a sample
 printout of another laser, it appears to equal the output power.  This isn't
 surprising since a lively 200 mW (rated) laser could put out more than 255
 mW, and some of the newer models are rated at much more.
<p>
<li><b>Prog Pwr:</b> This is an 8 bit representation (0 to 255) on the scale
 as "Green Pwr" (above) of the programmed 532 nm output power.  The laser will
 automatically adjust the operating parameters to keep the "Green Pwr" at
 this level.  This parameter can be adjusted by the user to serve as an output
 power level control.  It has much less effect on beam parameters than would
 occur by adjusting the pump power current (which isn't user adjustable
 anyhow!).  However, if this is set too high, the laser output will not be
 stable.  The laser will blink incessantly and possibly declare a "failure
 to lock" fault.  Lightwave recommends that the user adjust this parameter
 no higher than the factory setting.  Lowering it down to as far as around
 50 percent of the factory setting has only a small effect on beam
 parameters.
<p>
 With careful adjustment of the parameters affecting the lock algorithm
 scanning speed, "Prog Pwr" can be set very close to the maximum possible
 power the laser can produce - within 1 or 2 LSBs.  But if set too high,
 the output power will climb to the maximum, drop abruptly to zero, and
 the lock process try again, probably forever.  Perhaps it will declare
 a "failure to lock" fault, but I haven't seen it give up the futile attempt.
<p>
<li><b>Min Power:</b> This is an 8 bit representation (0 to 255) on the scale
 as "Green Pwr" (above) of the minimum power level required before the laser
 will attempt to lock on a particular mode of the doubler.  The laser scans
 the NPRO 1,064 nm frequency until this level of the 532 nm power is produced.
 This avoids certain locking difficulties (e.g., attempting to lock on modes
 other than the lowest TEM00 mode of the doubler).  This parameter should
 NOT be adjusted by the user.
<p>
 Indeed, if "Min Power" is set too low, my LWE-142 will lock onto the TEM10
 mode at up to around 100 mW.  This may be useful to have a dual beam laser
 but in general, the TEM00 mode is the one desired!
<p>
<li><b>Lock Tolerance:</b> This is the allowable deviation of "Green Pwr"
 from "Prog Pwr".  When the difference is less than this parameter, the laser
 considers itself "locked" and will light the red STATUS LED continuously.
 (Normally, the deviation is 1 bit or less.)  If the "Green Pwr" ever drops
 by more than this parameter, the laser will assume that lock has been lost
 and will attempt to reacquire lock by scanning the NPRO 1,064 nm frequency.
<p>
 The default setting of 20 for the "Lock Tolerance" seems to be set so high
 that most of the time, the laser should never decide that it has lost lock.
 Only if the input frequency tuning is used and swept too far, might this
 take effect.  But perhaps, that default is not correct.
</ul>
<p>
Most of the other numeric parameters are in 4 Hex digit format ($XXXX).
Exceptions are noted:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scan Fast Delta:</b> When searching for resonance, the laser will scan
 the temperature of the NPRO at one hundred (100) times this hexadecimal value
 per second.
<p>
<li><b>Limit:</b> The scan direction reverses when the scan value reaches
 these hexadecimal limits.
<p>
 I assume by "scan value", it means "Scan", the value that is added to the
 "Ref" value.
<p>
<li><b>Slow Delta:</b> When "DHErr" exceeds "Ref", the laser will slow the
 temperature scan to 10 times this hexadecimal value per second.
<p>
 The meaning of "DHErr" is not defined anywhere that I can find.  Since it's
 used in the context of "Ref", a hexadecimal temperature value, I assume that
 it is either the temperature setpoint or the actual temperature of the NPRO
 but will attempt to obtain confirmation.
<p>
<li><b>Int Gain:</b> This <i>decimal</i> value is used to control the loop
 gain of the locking circuit.
<p>
 The only values I've seen for "Int Gain" are 1 or 2.
<p>
<li><b>Slew Limit:</b> This number is used to limit the rate-of-change of the
 laser frequency (temperature) when the microprocessor is integrating the
 NPRO (laser crystal) temperature.  The error signal fed into the integrator
 is: [(Prog Pwr) - (Green Pwr)] or (Slew Limit), which has a smaller absolute
 value.  This parameter should NOT be changed by the user.
<p>
<li><b>Backoff State:</b> The temperature is backed off by the value
 corresponding to the state it's in when::
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>State 1 - Turning the diode on.
 <li>State 2 - "DHErr" first exceeds "Ref".
 <li>State 5 - When lock is lost as determined by "DHErr" dropping below "Ref". </ul>
<p>
<li><b>State:</b> This value indicates the current state of the firmware
 during the locking process:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>State 0 - Pump diode is off.
<p>
 <li>State 1 - Pump diode laser is on, temperature stabilizing.  The NPRO
  temperature is ramped linearly down to the minimum value for integration
  in preparation for the locking process to begin.
<p>
 <li>State 2 - Fast scan of NPRO temperature.  This is a fast integrating
  mode where the NPRO temperature is ramped up at a constant rate and the
  firmware looks for the output ("Green Pwr") to exceed a locking threshold
  for an acceptable mode ("Min Power").
<p>
 <li>State 3 - Slow scan of NPRO temperature.  When "Green Pwr" exceeds
  "Min Power" in State 2, the temperature jumps back a bit ("Backoff for
  State 2") to compensate for thermal hysteresis of the NPRO, and then
  integrates at a slower rate up towards the same locking threshold.
<p>
 <li>State 4 - Integrator active, NPRO locked to doubler.  This happens once
  the locking threshold has been reached (again), and the firmware attempts
  to do what it takes to achieve and then retain the setpoint power.
  In general, this means continuing to increase the NPRO temperature while
  watching the output power in a firmware implemented feedback loop.
<p>
  On my laser with the best set of parameters so far, the effect is essentially
  a slow constant rate increase in NPRO temperature until "Green Pwr" equals
  "Prog Pwr", at which point the temperature stops changing, but then begins
  decreasing if "Green Pwr" overshoots "Prog Pwr" (which it typically does by
  1 or 2 counts), until they are equal again, and so forth.  Most of the time
  it settles down very quickly.  However, occasionally, it will continue a
  low amplitude oscillation in output power for several cycles.
<p>
 <li>State 5 - Lock lost, goto State 2 (Actually, may go to State 0 because
  I think the pump diode turns off.)  This is essentially a fault state
  when the firmware sees a drop in power below another threhold ("Lock
  Tolerance"), and resets the NPRO temperature to the bottom of the
  integration curve, in anticipation of restarting the locking process.
  In other words, something really screwed up. :)
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>State Lock:</b> This bit can be toggled on or off.  When on, the
 laser will remain in whatever state it is regardless of error or
 completion signals.
<p>
<li><b>State Count:</b> This shows the number of temperature scans that have
 been performed attempting to lock.  The laser will perform three (3) short
 scans (State 2) followed by three (3) full scans (State 6?) before declaring
 a failure to lock fault.
<p>
<li><b>Diode Enable:</b> Status of pump diode.
<p>
<li><b>Extern Ena:</b> Status of control signal (LASE) from pin 12 of the DB15
 laser head connector.  On is when that pin is high or floating.  Pulling LASE
 low shuts off the laser instantly. 
<p>
 When the laser is re-enabled, the locking algorithm appears start at square
 one - at the low temperature limit rather than the last "Lock Ref" as
 it might be expected.
<p>
<li><b>Temp:</b> The actual hexadecimal value written into the D/A converter
 driving the NPRO temperature.
<p>
 I think this is the same as the value in the second column following
 "Lock Reference Temp" on the main screen, but that display is in decimal.
 Go figure. :)
<p>
<li><b>Ref:</b> The last hexadecimal value of "Temp" when entering State 4
 (locked).
<p>
 I think this is the same as the value next to "Lock Reference Temp"
 on the main screen, but that display is in decimal.
<p>
<li><b>Scan:</b> The current scan value in hexadecimal.  Add this value to
 "Ref" to produce "Temp" when in States 2 or 3.
<p>
<li><b>Int:</b> The current integrator value in hexadecimal.  Add this value
 to "Ref" to produce "Temp" when in State 4.
</ul>
<p>
Minor changes to these parameters should permit even a really uncooperative
laser to achieve a stable lock at very close to its maximum possible output
power as long as it produces some green output, though possibly at lower than
the rated power.  Almost every parameter can be changed and messing up even
one of them by one count may result in a laser that just flashes
continuously or only blinks its status LEDs with zero output.  However, no
actual damage can result even if 100 monkeys changed parameters at random.
So loading a valid set of parameters will restore operation assuming it
could play the violin, oops, lase previously. :)  See the next section
for an example.

This displays the actual D/A or A/D values for the listed parameters, and
several status bits.  Nothing on this screen can be changed except for the
Diode Temp, but that's the same as the parameter on the main screen.
<p>
<b>Temperature scan</b>
<p>
Typing a "T" from the main screen (in password protected mode) will take
you to diode and crystal scan test mode.  There are options for stepping
the respective temperature from one end of its range to the other with two
possible step sizes, two possible speeds, and in either direction.  This
This would permit the best temperature in each case to be determined.  However,
an external laser power meter is required since there is no laser power
display on the temperature scan screens and leaving them terminates the
scan.  Go figure. :)  I have used may data acquisition widget to capture
the entire range of power output versus crystal temperature in both
temperature scan directions.  See the section
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#scllwe142l">Locking Behavior of the LWE-142 Laser</A>
for sample plots.
<p>
<b>Power monitor calibration</b>
<p>
Typing an "M" from the main screen (in password protected mode) will take
you to a power calibration screen.  As far as I can tell, this must be a
vestige of some other model laser.  Although it allows for the adjustment
of a calibration parameter, that parameter doesn't seem to do anything at all.
<p>
<b>Zero Operating Hours</b>
<p>
Typing a "Z" from the main screen (in password protected mode) will reset the
"Number of hours" to 0.
<p>
<b>Set Serial Number</b>
<p>
Typing an "H" from the main screen (in password protected mode) will enable
the "Serial #" field to be set.  The firmware expects numeric characters and
will act like it's hung to until it is satisfied!  It's possible that the
locking firmware isn't running while in this mode so the laser could do
anything.  I saw it climb from my set power of 150 mW to almost 170 mW
until I got it under control.  So, like what it will say on the screen in
this mode, type (number) keys until it is what you want and then hit
return.  Exactly why one should <i>need</i> to set the serial number is
not at all clear, except that on my laser, it somehow got messed up.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142p">Problems and Quirks of an LWE-142</A></h3>

I'm trying to tune up a 200 mW LWE-142.
<p>
I don't know for sure if there is something fundamentally wrong with this
unit, though it's very likely and my best guess would be that the pump
diode is a bit weak, there is a slight misalignment, or the doubler temperature
needs to be fine tuned.  But it's also possible
that it simply needs some tender loving care to have it
parameters adjusted.  The case history is that the laser was returned to
the manufacturer because it wasn't remaining locked at its spec'd power.
They simply reduced the power to 93 mW where it locked happily, and
sent it to the person from whom I acquired it.  So, it is not known
whether there was a real problem or they were just too lazy to bother
and swapped it for a new laser.
<p>
When I received this unit, all it would do was flash and blink attempting
to achieve a stable lock and my initial thought was: "Hmmm, this is much worse
than I had been led to believe".  But, then I noticed that someone who shall
remain nameless had messed up some key parameters on the Green Acquisition
Calibration (G) screen.  Here is a screen shot of the original INCORRECT
settings:

</PRE>
<p>
DO NOT enter these into your LWE-142 unless you just want a laser that
twitches constantly. :)
<p>
The first four parameters (starting with "Prog Pwr") are all in the same units.
For this laser the actual output power is about twice the Prog Pwr power
monitor calibration.  I haven't figured out how to change it, if that's
even possible.  The Laser Power Monitor Calibration command accessible
from the main screen doesn't appear to do anything useful and looks more
like a vestige from some other model Lightwave laser, possibly the forerunner
to this, the Model 140.
<p>
Once I reset the obviously incorrect parameters starting with Scan
Fast Delta to those of the typical example shown in the previous
section, the laser would at least try to lock but was usually
unsuccessful even at a Prog Pwr setting of only 40 (corresponding to
an output power of 80 mW) because the firmware was changing the
crystal temperature too quickly.  So, it would overshoot the selected
power by a huge amount, exceed the maximum power that was possible,
and lose lock before it could stabilize.  Decreasing the Delta
values enabled it to reliably lock at 100 mW (Prog Pwr of 50) but it was
more likely to lock with a TEM10 beam rather than a TEM00 beam.  This isn't
surprising considering that the relatively strong TEM10 mode occurs at a
lower temperature than the desired TEM00 mode, so it will be found first
during the initial temperature scan.
<p>
However, with a bit more fiddling, Prog Pwr could be raised to 76 resulting
in a stable TEM00 output power of over 150 mW.  And, the laser will
now power up and lock at 150 mW consistently.  Changing the Delta
parameters slows down the rate of change of crystal temperature
during the locking process so that the overshoot is reduced to 1 or 2
(out of 76) of the Green Pwr and locking can be achieved very close to
the maximum power available - a Green Pwr setting of 80 to 85
for this laser depending on its mood.  Since 150 mW is more than is
possible with even the liveliest higher order mode, if it does
try to lock to one of these, it will give up until it finds a TEM00
mode and then succeed.  (More on higher order modes below.)
However, with Min Power set to 40, most of the time this is
unnecessary.  With Min Power set to 30 as it was originally, locking to
the TEM00 mode was the exception rather than the rule.
<p>

<p>
As noted, I can get about 150 mW of stable TEM00 output power consistently.
Also, while it is known that the doubler will
support higher order spatial (transverse) modes, this laser can
lock at over 100 mW of TEM10, which is quite high considering
that the maximum power for the TEM00 mode is under 200 mW
for this laser.  It should be possible to lock the TEM01 mode at 30 or 40
mW as well though I haven't tried that.  Other higher order modes are possible
and I've seen TEM20, TEM02, TEM11, TEM12, TEM21, and TEM22 at the very least,
but only TEM10 and TEM01 can be produced at a power of more than a few mW.
<p>
It's almost certain these higher order modes are doubler modes, not
NPRO (1,064 nm fundamental) modes, because they have a cartesian pattern
consistent with the doubler geometry.  Due to the peculiar shape of the NPRO
crystal, its modes are, well, strange.  Another confirmation would be to
combine the two sub-beams of a TEM10 or TEM01 mode and measure the beat
frequency.  If they are NPRO modes, then there will be a beat frequency
in the low GHz range but if they are doubler modes, they are mutually
coherent and will produce a beat frequency of eactly 0 Hz and fringe
patterns.  So, in that case, running this laser in TEM10 mode would
be a good way to get two beams for holography or interferometry at
relatively high power without a beamsplitter.  Woopie!  OK, if nothing
else, this feature is kind of interesting.  How many lasers do you know
of that can be remotely configured to produce a stable TEM00, TEM01, or
TEM10 beam profile on demand, sort of? :)
<p>
The underlying problem with this laser may also be related in some way to
this significant TEM10 and TEM01 power.  Perhaps, there is some misalignment.
But, the mode behavior could also be normal.
<p>
Another minor quirk is that when first powered on, there is no trouble
locking at as high as 160 mW or even a bit more.  In fact, I've seen it
hit 190 mW and would probably lock there if nudged up from a stable
160 mW.  But, sometimes I've found that the maximum stable power will
decrease slightly after being on for awhile.  I've heard that this
behavior has been observed on other LWE-142s.  My cooling is fairly
good but the baseplate does get just detectably warm to the touch,
so perhaps that may even be too much.  My theory?: On these lasers,
the pump diode is attached to a TEC which is glued to the baseplate
directly, but all the other crystals and optics are mounted on the
ceramic substrate which is mounted separately to the baseplate.  So,
any change in baseplate temperature may affect the alignment of the
pump beam to the NPRO resulting in a slight change in 1,064 nm power.
In fact, the value for "Crystal Photo Mon", a measure of the 1,064 nm
power, does decline by a few percentafter the laser has been on for awhile.
There may also be a small but possibly significant shift in the NPRO
beam alignment with respect to the doubler.  If the internal organization
of this laser is like that of the dual wavelength LWE-142 (see the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#scllwe142h">Construction of the LWE-142 Laser Head</A>),
there is several inches between the NPRO and doubler making their relative
alignment much more sensitive than if the NPRO and doubler were
next to one-another.  Either or both of these can affect maximum 532 nm
power.  It could also be that changes in the temperature of other components
that don't have active temperature control are affecting performance.
<p>
I have a user manual dated 1996 for the laser.  My unit has a manufacturing
date of 1999.  There are some things in the manual that don't quite agree with
the actual laser but it's close enough for most purposes.
<p>
I have installed the open-frame DC power supply I was using into a box
salvaged from some unidentified data switch something or other.  My
setup is shown in <A HREF="lwe142p1.jpg">Photo of Sam's LWE-142 Test Setup</A>.
This shows the power supply box, LWE-142 laser head mounted on massive
aluminum plate and cooling fan, and my vintage Kiwi laptop running PCPLUS.
(Yes, the Kiwi has the latest version of Win95 loaded!)  The "G" screen is
being displayed and is similar to the one in the previous section with the
LWE-142 locked at a power setting of 76 (about 150 mW).  The power supply
box has switches and LEDs that more or less duplicate the functions of the
Lightwave model 142A power supply that goes with the LWE-142.  I even added
the BNC tuning inputs (after this photo was taken).  Actually, my power
supply box is a little fancier than Lightwave's. :)  The photo shows the power
switch and power on indicator, keylock enable and green LED, On button and
yellow LED, and Off button with the red Emission LED above it.
I have now added circuitry to the slow tuning input which includes
a 10 turn pot with high (+/-10 Ghz, +/-5 V) and low (+/-1 GHz, +/-0.5 V)
settings for offset, a switch to select internal (pot), external (BNC),
or both (+), and a third BNC to monitor the actual voltage on pin 14 (Mon).
Where the full +/-10 V range is needed (I can't imagine why!), a voltage can
be applied directly into the Mon BNC which is isolated from the
op-amp buffer with a 10K ohm resistor, so it effectively has a 5K ohm
input impedance.  In addition, where an even smaller range is desired
to provide finer control near 0 V, a load resistor can be placed across the
Mon BNC, and to guarantee absolutely exactly 0 V, a short can be placed across
the Mon BNC.  See <A HREF="lwe142a1.gif">Sam's LWE-142 Power Supply
Control Panel</A>.
<p>
The power supply box works fine but there are a couple of strange things
relating to the LASE and ON signals, which would not be noticed if the
laser were simply powered up without using them:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>LASE</b> is supposed to disable lasing when pulled low or shorted to
 ground.  This works as expected and the laser turns off instantly.  BUT,
 rather than remembering the previous crystal locking temperature when
 turned back on by lifting LASE, the controller insists on starting at
 one end of the temperature range ($0000 hex) to find a new stable point.
 This is apparently the same thing it does when powered on.
 While eventually locking successfully, this doesn't make sense.  Why not
 assume that where it was last locked might be a good place to go??? ;-)
<p>
<li><b>ON</b> is supposed be a TTL signal that shows the status of the laser
 diode (on = high).  However, it must be used internally to actually
 turn the laser diode on - and not at a TTL level but somewhere above +4 VDC.
 It reads +5 VDC unloaded, +4 VDC with a 3.3K ohm resistor which I was using in
 series with the base of a 2N3904 transistor to turn on an LED.  So far, that
 looks like it might be TTL with an internal pullup or a TTL-compatible
 CMOS output.  However, the laser diode refuses to turn on with that 3.3K ohm
 load present.  The controller *thinks* everything is fine and tries to go
 through the lock search algorithm but the diode current always remains
 at 0.0 A.  It's too stupid to realize the diode isn't even on and searching
 for green light will be a waste of CPU cycles. :)
<p>
 If the load is removed at any time, the laser immediately springs to life
 as though everything is normal.  The base resistor had to be increased to
 15K ohms for the load to be ignored.
</ul>
<p>
I'm not sure if either or both of these are features or bugs but I've
been told they are present on other LWE-142 lasers, at least those
manufactured around the same time as mine!
<p>
I'm interested in any additional information, a newer user manual or
more detailed documentation.
<p>
Also, of course, other samples of this laser in any condition for
exploration and FAQ enhancement.  I really don't want to go inside
this one as long as it works, though apparently, some of the parameters
that may need adjusting are controlled by physical pots and not bits.
Imagine that. :)
<p>
<b>Open questions</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Based on my preliminary tests, the Slow Tuning input may actually
 control the doubler temperature (contrary to what is implied in the
 manual), and the firmware causes the NPRO temperature to track it to
 maintain the power output constant.  The opposite - adding an offset to
 the NPRO temperature - should result in the firmware fighting the tuning
 input with only a transient shift in frequency which then corrects itself.
 Is this how it works?  Might the description in the manual simply be
 left over from a previous version of the laser where the LWE-142
 where the doubler tempeerature was what the firmware controlled to lock to
 the NPRO mode rather than the other way around?
<p>
 Or does the locking input affect both the NPRO and doubler temperatures
 at the same time with the firmware just correcting for tracking error?
<p>
<li>According to the manual, the maximum rate of change of both the slow and
 fast frequency inputs is about the same and the bandwidth of the fast input
 is insufficient to allow for linewidth reduction.  So, what's the benefit of the
 fast frequency input?  Just to enable Pound-Drever-Hall locking to an iodine
 spectral line or other external reference?
<p>
<li>The manual says that RET (pin 15 on the DB15 head connector) for the
 tuning inputs is not to be used as power ground.  Should it simply go off
 to the two BNCs?  Should it be tied to power ground via a resistor?
<p>
<li>Is the locking entirely an optical/thermal phenomenon or is there
 active low level circuitry involved (bsides what the firmware controls)?
 In other words, is the behavior of the doubler a result of intracavity
 power buildup, thermal expansion, and mode pulling, or is there some active
 control of its TEC during locking, or something else?
<p>
<li>On the "Green Acquisition Calibration" (G) screen description in the
 manual, what is DRErr?  This variable or parameter shows up in the
 user manual dated 1996 with respect to "Slow Delta" and "Backoff State".
<p>
 From the manual:
<p>
<blockquote>
    Slow Delta: When "DHErr" exceeds "Ref", the laser will slow the
    temperature scan to 10 times this hexadecimal value per second.
<p>
    Backoff State:</b> The temperature is backed off by the value
    corresponding to the state it's in when:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>State 1 - Turning the diode on.
  <li>State 2 - "DHErr" first exceeds "Ref".
  <li>State 5 - When lock is lost as determined by "DHErr" dropping below
   "Ref".
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
<p>
  The meaning of "DHErr" is not defined anywhere that I can find.  Since it's
  used in the context of "Ref", a hexadecimal temperature value, I assume that
  it is either the temperature setpoint or the actual temperature of the NPRO.
<p>
<li>What is State 6?  From the manual:
<p>
<blockquote>
   State Count: This shows the number of temperature scans that have
   been performed attempting to lock.  The laser will perform three (3) short
   scans (State 2) followed by three (3) full scans (State 6) before
   declaring a "failure to lock fault".
<p>
  Or, should it have said "all 6 states".
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>When the threshold is exceeded in State 2 and it backs off the temperature
 when going to State 3, if the laser responds too quickly resulting in the
 "Green Pwr" dropping below the threshold, this firmware revision goes back
 to State 2 and ends up in an infinite loop.  This happens only occasionally
 from a cold start but would seem to be a bug, not a feature.  No? :)
<p>
<li>Why does the laser not remember where it was locked when forced to standby
 mode by the LASE signal going low but simply appears to restart at the low
 end of the crystal temperature scan?
<p>
<li>Why can't the ON output (lase status) be loaded by resistance less than
 about 15K ohms to ground without the pump diode going off?  The manual says
 it's a TTL output but it behaves as though it is used to enable the pump
 diode somewhere at a level above 4 V.
<p>
<li>Should the laser case be connected to Earth ground via the power supply
 line cord? 
<p>
<li>Why doesn't the "M" screen (power monitor calibration) do anything
 useful? :)  Is it simply a vestige from a prevous model laser like the 140?
<p>
<li>Are there any patents covering the doubler and locking mechanism?  My
 search could not locate any assigned the Lightwave Electronics.
<p>
<li>For some reason, the serial number got corrupted and I had to fix it.
 So, why is there a "Set Serial Number" command at all other than to fix it
 after getting overwritten by a firmware bug???? :)
<p>
<li>And finally, why are the same parameters displayed in decimal on the
 main screen and in hexadecimal on the "G" screen? :)

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142l">Locking Behavior of the LWE-142 Laser</A></h3>

When the LWE-142 is attempting to lock the doubler to the NPRO, it starts
at the lowest crystal temperature and increases it until it sees at least
the amount of green power determined by the Min Power parameter on the
Green Acquisition Calibration (G) screen indicating that a TEM00 mode
has been found.  It then backs up and more slowly increases the crystal
temperature somewhat slower until Min Power is exceeded, and then even
slower until the Green Pwr is achieved.  This is all controlled by the
parameters on the G screen.  Increasing the crystal temperature actually
increases the wavelength of the fundamental (1,064 nm) output of the NPRO
subject to one or more places where it mode-hops.
<p>
However, the behavior of the LWE-142 during this process is
fascinating and somewhat counterintuitive.  What might be expected is
that as the crystal temperature is increased, the wavelength of the
1,064 output of the NPRO either also increases smoothly over a portion
of the full range or will mode-hop (back) at a few locations.  (But
these probably won't be near a point of maximum output power and
wouldn't be desirable locking points anyhow.)  Then, when the NPRO
wavelength approaches resonance with a doubler mode, it might be
expected that the green output power would smoothly increase to a
maximum value and then smoothly decrease on the other side of the
peak.  But this doesn't happen except possibly for very low power
higher order modes.  Rather, the output power increases smoothly to
the maximum power possible for the specific mode - and then drops
like a rock to 0.0 mW.  As far as I know, there is no active electronics
involved in the low level locking process.  However, this is not out of
the question and could also account for the observed behavior.  So,
assuming that no such locking circuits are involved, the one explanation
that makes some sense is that as the doubler approaches resonance and the
doubler's intracavity power begins increasing, there is increased heating of
the doubler crystal itself which causes its wavelength to also increase.  The
NPRO and doubler modes then track each-other becoming closer and closer until
the output power reaches the maximum available for the specific mode being
excited.  There is a kind of intrinsic negative feedback at work here
to maintain lock at just the right point: If the doubler gets too hot, its
wavelength will move away from that of the NPRO and the intracavity power
will drop, reducing its temperature.  But the mode pulling can't be
maintained beyond the point where green output power saturates due to
the available NPRO input power and losses in the doubler cavity.  Once
tracking can't be maintained, the wavelengths move away from each other
and the reduction in heating causes the doubler to fall out of
resonance very rapidly, causing the power to drop to zero.  At that point,
the wavelength of the NPRO is well beyond the unheated wavelength
of the doubler so it can't reaquire lock.  Or something along those lines. :)
Note that the NPRO, being a unidirectional ring cavity, is highly immune to
effects of back-reflections so I don't think that it is affected by what's
going on in the doubler (i.e., there is no mutual coupling).
<p>
Think of it as a "resonant build-up" rather than simply adjusting the laser
for a specific peak of the doubler.  The green power builds up as the NPRO
temperature is increased, and the intracavity power builds up in the doubler.
<p>
Here are output power-versus-temperature plots for my LWE-142 showing what
happens as the temperature is incrementally scanned at a constant rate
from low-to-high and then from high-to-low using the Temperature Scan
command described above.  The horizontal scale is the same for both plots but
the axis is reversed for the second plot with respect to lasing modes because
the temperature is changing in the opposite direction.  However, note that the
vertical scale factors differ by a factor of 100 as discussed below.
The total duration for each plot is a bit over 12 minutes.  Each scan consists
of 368 steps of 2 second duration with an increment or decrement of 178 to
cover the entire 65536 (16 bit) range of 15 &deg;C or 20 &deg;C.  I have no
idea why the scan firmware uses this peculiar step size but possibly 178
actually translates into a nice round temperature like 0.05 &deg;C. :)
<p>
To create these plots, my "instrumentation" consisted of a $2 photodiode
feeding one of the analog inputs of a
<A HREF="http://www.dataq.com/194.htm">DATAQ Chart Recorder Starter
Kit</A> attached to a second laptop running WinME.  (The first one is
my ancient Kiwi being used to control the laser with PCPLUS.
It has only a single serial port.  And, because the Kiwi has no
built in CDROM drive or USB ports, loading the WINDAQ software using
an external drive would have taken way too long and filled up a
substantial portion of the available harddisk space anyhow!)  The
photodiode is reverse biased by 30 VDC from a +/-15 VDC power supply
with a variable load resistor to set the calibration.  The output is
taken between the junction of the resistor and the photodiode, and
power supply common (0 VDC).

<p>
The component values shown were selected for lasers with a maximum power
output of around 1 mW.  For this laser which may produce 200 mW or more, a
neutral density filter was installed in the beam path with an OD value
experimentally determined to result in nearly full scale output at 200 mW.
The capacitor across the input is intended to minimize noise
pickup.  The resulting filter rolls off at around 30 Hz.  The sampling rate
was 60 Hz.
<p>
Originally, I planned to use a 45 degree mirror with a small hole drilled
through its center to separate out the TEM00 mode from the TEM01, TEM10, and
most other higher order modes, so they could be recorded on separate channels.
It was going to be sooooo cool!  But that setup became unwieldy so we're stuck
with single plots. :)
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="lwe142t1.gif">LWE-142 Crystal Temperature Scan: Low to High</A>
 shows the green output power as the crystal temperature is increased.
 The vertical calibration factor for this plot is approximately <b>200 mW</b>
 full scale.
<p>
 When scanned from low-to-high, the doubler locks onto the 1,064 nm laser
 mode with power increasing until it suddenly loses lock and abruptly drops
 to zero in less than 0.05 seconds (based on viewing the raw data).
 This behavior is consistent with the explanation given above with respect
 to thermal mode pulling of the doubler cavity locking the NPRO and doubler
 modes.  The tallest peaks are the TEM00 mode, the next tallest peaks are the
 TEM10 mode, the smallest of the tall peaks are the TEM01 mode, and all the
 other small blips are higher order modes.  The two groups of 3 large peaks
 probably correspond to continuous tuning of NPRO - without mode-hops.
 But where a mode is missing, it's not entirely obvious what is going on.
 This may indicate that a mode-hop has occurred or that the doubler
 cavity is not resonating with that particular mode for some reason.
 What is clear is that the continuous tuning range (or FSR) of the
 NPRO cavity is not much different than the FSR of the doubler cavity.
<p>
 The NPRO is probably mode-hopping just after the mid-height peaks near the
 center of the plot and also near the end of the plot (possibly actually
 terminating the second of the double peaks which should be TEM00).  Aside
 from slight differences in amplitude, the left and right mode patterns are
 identical.  That higher amplitude also implies that the TEM00 peaks on the
 left should be better operating points.  And, there does appear to be some
 slight advantage when the laser is locked there.
<p>
 But this raises more questions than it answers.  Assuming that there is
 an NPRO mode-hop around the middle of the plot since the left and right
 halves are virtually identical, what's up with the missing modes?  For
 example, the first three substantial peaks correspond to the TEM10, TEM00,
 and TEM01 modes, respectively.  But the next group is missing the TEM10
 mode entirely.  Why?  For that matter, what type of alignment (or
 misalignment) and resonator configuration result in spatial modes where
 for TEMxy, X is not equal to Y and interchange with wavelength?
 The equations I've seen for higher order modes in typical resonators still
 show a mode spacing of c/2L so groupings of modes would be expected to be
 the same,  Of course, they probably all assumed ideal configurations with
 perfect alignment of the cavity and the input beam.
<p>
<li><A HREF="lwe142t2.gif">LWE-142 Crystal Temperature Scan: High to Low</A>
 shows the green output power as the crystal temperature is decreased.
 The vertical calibration factor for this plot is approximately <b>2 mW</b>
 full scale.  A combination of removing the ND1.7 filter in front of the sensor
 and adjusting the vertical scale factor was needed for the high-to-low run.
 Otherwise, the blips would have been buried in the mud.
<p>
 When scanned from high-to-low, the behavior is dramatically different
 and was somewhat unexpected, though it does make sense with 20/20 hindsight.
 Only low power (under 2 mW) very short duration spikes occur and there
 is no evidence of locking.  This, too, is consistent with the explanation
 given above.  When the temperature is being reduced, as the doubler starts
 to resonate with the 1,064 nm mode, the internal temperature of the doubler
 <i>increases</i> as before, but that drives it <i>away</i> from
 resonance.  It also results in a negative feedback that produces some
 low power balanced between how close to resonance the wavelength is
 and thermal heating driving it away from resonance.  The full rise time is
 very short - under 0.05 seconds to a pointy spike, but as the NPRO wavelength
 decreases, the output power immediately begins to die out with a curve
 that has a roughly exponential-squared profile with a time constant of about
 1 second.  The amplitude is low because there is no benefit from locking and
 mode pulling.  I have not confirmed which peaks correspond to specific modes
 but would guess the relationship to be generally similar to the low-to-high
 case.  However, note that since the thermal effects driving the doubler away
 from resonance are smaller for the higher order modes, their relative power
 is actually higher compared to the case where locking occurs and the
 variation in height is probably more random.
</ul>
<p>
The Gerstenberger et. al.  doubler paper referenced above in the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#scllwe142d">Basic Description of the LWE-142</A>
actually shows plots of similar behavior with NPRO temperatures scans.
However, their locking scheme was much more complex than what is used
in the LWE-142 since they were locking to the peak of the doubler resonance
to obtain maximum green power.  The LWE-142 simply locks to a
selected output power which falls on the slope of the resonance response,
greatly simplifying the implementation.  As can be inferred from the
description and plots, above, trying to balance on the peak would require
much more complex feedback than some stupid firmware can provide. :)
<p>
The doubler temperature setpoint is fixed (though its internal temperature
may be shifted slightly as resonance builds up) and the NPRO is slaved to it.
When the frequency approaches a resonant doubler peak is when we get green, but
we have to balance that against the FSR of the NPRO due to mode-hops in
the gain bandwidth function. Some temperature locations in the NPRO may be
better than others at locking due to their proximity (or lack thereof) to
a mode-hop.  The temperature of the doubler is critical to this process.
<p>
I made another couple of plots of the startup behavior of the same laser.
<A HREF="lwe142s1.gif">LWE-142 Output Power During Startup/Restart 1</A>
shows three (3) sequences of output power during the locking process.
The plot is divided input approximately equal sections.  The first begins
just before the pump diode turns on following initialization from a cold
start and runs until the laser is locked at 150 mW; the second and third
segments show behavior when restarted by pulling LASE to ground for 15 to
30 seconds.  (The gaps are visible as abrupt drops to exactly 0.0 mW at
around the 1/3rd and 2/3rd points.)
<p>
I have no explanation for why there are a dozen ripples prior to a stable
lock only in the first restart (middle section).  The peak-to-peak amplitude is
order of 3 percent, or +/-1 count in the "Green Pwr", which might have not
appeared significant on the "G" screen without the plot.  I also don't know
why some of the overshoots are so large.  Also note the large spike near the
start of the third section.  That was a TEM00 mode where the power was
climbing so quickly that it overshot by too much (the peak is over 170
mW) and lock was lost.
<p>
But, all the overshoots were somewhat larger than
possible because the I had changed the "Backoff" value for State 2 from
$0300 to $0200 in an attempt to remedy another peculiar problem: On the
previous startup from power on, the laser got stuck oscillating between 70 and
90 mW and never reached the selected power because when it crossed 80 mW
(the "Min Green Pwr" setting), the temperature value is backed off and
for some reason, at the mode it was locking to, the output power dropped
rather than continuing to rise or remain the same as it usually does.  When the
power dropped below 80 mW, then eventually started to rise and again crossed
80 mW, the result was an infinite loop.  This could be clearly seen by
watching the "G" screen.  I have no idea whether this was due
to a bug in the firmware or a one time glitch since it has not happened
again. :)  Additional fiddling with the locking parameters could probably
eliminate these problems.  Unfortunately, the original factory settings for
this laser were lost and Lightwave/Uniphase has been unwilling or unable to
retrieve them from their archives.
<p>
Another nearly identical run is shown in <A HREF="lwe142s2.gif">LWE-142
Output Power During Startup/Restart 2</A>.  This had the original value for
State 2 Backoff ($0300).  Even so, there is a huge overshoot
on the initial startup, just barely getting under control before lock would
have been lost due to excessive power.  And, no, I have no idea why there
is a blip in the middle of the stablized region of the first section, nor
the funny small aborted decaying plateau just after the tall spike. :)
But the restarts have very modest overshoot! :)
<p>
While these plots were made for an LWE-142 that has some problems,
except for the output power being lower than spec'd, this behavior is
expected to be very similar for a healthy laser.  However, it's possible
that the relative amplitude of the TEM10 and TEM01 modes compared to the TEM00
mode might be smaller if the problem is related to alignment.
<p>
It's possible that older versions of the LWE-142 had the doubler locked to
the NPRO frequency, scanning the doubler temperature instead of the crystal
temperature, as is done with later units which have the NPRO locked to the
doubler.  However, as a practical matter, there probably isn't much
difference unless the precise frequency of the laser is important.
Some versions of the laser may have also used more sophisticated locking
schemes including something called "Driever-Hall", a form of fast
dithering with synchronous demodulation.  Are you still awake? :)

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142t">Tuning behavior of the LWE-142 Laser</A></h3>

After adding the tuning controls to my LWE-142 laser power supply
(see <A HREF="lwe142a1.gif">Sam's LWE-142 Power Supply Control Panel</A>),
I performed some very preliminary tuning experiments, really just to see
how the controller responds to a tuning input.  The knob allows an offset
of up to +/-0.5 V or (+/-1 GHz, fine mode) or +/-0.5 V or (+/-1 GHz, coarse
mode) to be applied to the Slow Tuning input alone, or added to an external
tuning voltage.
<p>
For the first test, I allowed the laser to initialize normally and then
applied about 100 mV to the Slow Tuning input (pin 14) by slowly turning
the Offset knob about 1 turn clockwise.  Within a few seconds, the "Green
Pwr" on the "G" screen began increasing and the NPRO temperature setpoint
value ("Temp" on the "G" screen) began decrementing.  "Green Pwr" had been
at 81.  It increased to about 90 before falling back and undershooting to
74.  When it went below 81, the firmware reversed direction and increased
"Temp" as usual.  Some oscillations followed with decreasing amplitude,
which I assume would have resulted in the power leveling off back at 81,
though I didn't wait for that to complete.  Reducing the offset to 0
resulted in similar gyrations in reverse (but without the large
oscillations), settling down again back at 81.
<p>
This behavior indicates that what the tuning input does is add an offset to
the doubler temperature and what happens is that the firmware
then adjusts the NPRO temperature to maintain green power constant.
In fact, providing an offset to the slow tuning input is a way of
determining if the doubler is set at optimal temperature, and also
a way of correcting it if needed without going inside the laser head
to fiddle with the pot. :)
<p>
It's possible that the description in the manual which talks about changing
NPRO temperature is simply a carryover from previous versions of the LWE-142
where the doubler tempeerature was what the firmware controlled to lock to
the NPRO mode rather than the other way around.
<p>
Indeed further tests have confirmed that the effect of the slow tuning
input is to change the doubler temperature.  Over an voltage input range
of about -0.5 V to +0.5 VDC, the doubler temperature varied from 118 &deg;C
to 117.2 &deg;C as displayed on the main screen.  The NPRO temperature then
was adjusted by the firmware in an attempt to maintain the same output power.
The laser would not lock at 150 mW once the voltage went above about 0.25 V
so this suggests that the doubler was on the downslope of its phase matching
range.  I didn't test for an increase in locking power going the other way,
but it didn't lose lock all the way to -0.5 V.
<p>
On another LWE-142, it was possible to increase the maximum output power
by offsetting the slow tuning input by -0.265 V.  The doubler temperature
changed from 117.5 &deg;C to 117.7 &deg;C.  And, returning the input to
0 V but adjusting the internal pot for double temperature to 117.7 &deg;C
produced the identical result.  Eventually, I'll try this with the first
LWE-142.
<p>
I recently acquired an iodine gas absorption cell.  This is a glass
vial filled with iodine vapor at low pressure, with Brewster windows
on both ends.  It was part of an iodine stabilized 632.8 nm HeNe laser
where the iodine cell was inside the cavity and used to lock the wavelength
to a very precise iodine absorption line.  I bought the thing on eBay for
the two-Brewster HeNe laser tube without even knowing there was an
iodine cell in the assembly.   The tube appears to be unusable but
the surprise iodine cell more than makes up for that!  Surplus iodine
cells are almost non-existent. :)
<p>
It used to be possible to buy the LWE-142 with an "Iodine Line" option
which would guarantee that a major line of the iodine gas absorption
would coincide with operation near full power.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioiivcr">The Iodine
Vapor Cell Wavelength Reference</A>.)
Each dip in <A HREF="i532a1.gif">Iodine Absorption Spectrum
Near 532 nm</A> means the iodine vapor is absorbing
some of the incident light and the gas will actually fluoresce
a green or green-yellow color, which is actually a combination of many
wavelengths including some red ones.  The lower the dip, the brighter it
will glow and also reduce the light coming out the other end.  I'm not
quite sure where the exact center of the Nd:YVO4 gain curve would fall on this
plot.  Corrections and additions welcome.
<p>
I tested this laser with the iodine cell and unfortunately, it would not
lock at a major iodine absorption line, though it did lock with a medium
strength one.  This isn't surprising given that the absorption lines
are few in number and rather narrow.
I was able to get it to lock at a setting that resulted in a decent
glow in the iodine cell but not nearly as intense as could be seen in
the transients during a temperature scan or when unsuccessfully attempting
to lock to a non-TEM00 spatial mode.  The modes that were best were higher
order modes like TEM11 or TEM12, which could sustain almost no power.
But they were as bright at a couple mW as the puny absorption line when
locked at 150 mW.  A 5 mW green laser pointer produced about the same
brightness inside the iodine cell as the 150 mW LWE-142.  (But the
pointer isn't single frequency so it may even be exciting multiple lines.)
<p>
In-depth tuning measurements will have to wait until I have access to a
wavemeter to determine the wavelength to picometer resolution and an iodine
absorption cell (which I intend to construct) to see about tuning to
specific iodine spectral lines.
<p>
More to follow.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142h">Construction of the LWE-142 Laser Head</A></h3>

Special thanks to Steve Swartz for providing the photos as well as much of the
description below, and to Phil Bergeron (pbergero@cas.usf.edu) for providing
additional comments, documentation, and his experiences with the LWE-142.
<p>
The Model 142 laser head consists of the laser and optics components inside
a sealed box as well as the microprocessor-based controller,
and drivers for the pump diode and its TEC, the NPRO (crystal) TEC and
piezo element (if there is any electronics involved with it), and the
doubler oven.  It interfaces to the outside via the RS232 port and the
Power and Status LEDs.
<p>
This section deals with the laser and optics box; the next section
describes the electronics.
<p>
<b>Laser head components</b>
<p>

<li><A HREF="lwe142v3.jpg">Interior View of LWE-142 Laser Head - Front</A>.
 For this dual-output version, the final mirrors in the optics train can
 be seed behind the apertures for the 1,064 nm output (left) and 532 nm output
 (right).  The center aperture is not used.
</ul>
<p>
Except for where the beams exit, the more common single wavelength LWE-142
should be similar.
<p>
<b>Inside the LWE-142 optics box</b>
<p>
The sealed optics box has the pump diode, NPRO for the fundamental (1,064 nm),
the resonant doubler, and bunch of mirrors/lenses to move the 1,064 nm and
532 nm beams around inside the box.  Most components are mounted
on a ceramic substrate on little gold-plated islands using low
temperature solder.  (At least, I assume it's ceramic or something similar
to have the required rigidity.)  Some of the larger modules may be mounted
with glue as there is no solder visible around their edges.  
<p>
Here are photos of the interior of the optics box.  The first one is how
it appears when the lid is removed.  The second shows the NPRO once the
magnet assembly is removed.  This unit is actually a
type 142-532-045DW laser manufactured in 1997.  The DW indicates that both
the 532 nm and 1064 nm beams are brought out of the box for experiments that
are designed to use both f and 2f in measurements.  The "-45" probably means
that it was rated at 45 mW of 532 nm and around 20 mW of 1,064 nm.  Being
dual-wavelength, the complexity of the optics is somewhat higher than for
the much more common single wavelength version.
<p>

  at the bottom of the photo.  A reverse polarity protection diode can be seen
  across the diode inputs.  The diode heatsink block is not actually sitting
  on the ceramic substrate but pokes through a hole from below and must be
  glued to a TEC directly in contact with the bottom plate.
<p>
 <li>The pair of green wires in the upper left are probably for the pump
  diode TEC mounted under the ceramic substrate.
<p>
 <li>The large metal plate visible in the first photo holds the magnet to
  force unidirectional lasing in the NPRO Nd:YAG crystal.  One corner and
  edge of the magnet are just visible poking out from under the plate.  It
  was removed for the second photo.  The magnetic field direction is
  diagonal from lower left to upper right (or vice-versa).
<p>
 <li>The NPRO Nd:YAG crystal is under the white
  square which has "K.I.P." printed on it.  This is the piezo element.
  The connections going to the NPRO should be for the crystal TEC (blue
  wires), the temperature sense thermistor (white wires), and the piezo
  element (thin wires to contacts on the white square).
<p>
 <li>The gold cylinder between the laser diode and NPRO is
  a GRIN lens to focus the output of the pump diode into the NPRO crystal.
  The required cylindrical microlens for fast-axis beam correction can just
  barely be seen attached to a pair of glass standoffs straddling the diode
  C-mount.
<p>
 <li>The metal box with two wires coming out of it in the upper left hand
  corner is a photodiode, probably for the 1,064 fundamental (used for
  "Crystal Photo Mon" on the "S" screen, and the "Noise Eater" feedback).
<p>
 <li>The white rectangle with the solder stripe cocked at a funny angle
  near the center bottom of the picture is the monolithic MgO:LiNbO3
  doubler.  The connections for its heater or TEC and thermistor
  temperature sensor can be seen on the lower left.  The additional
  blue wire on top of the doubler may be for a piezo element or
  electro-optic connection as this laser may use a more
  sophisticated locking scheme than the newer single wavelength versions.
<p>
 <li>The metal box towards the upper right is the photodiode for green (532 nm)
  power monitoring ("Green Pwr").  The white plate at an angle in front
  of it is probably used as an attenuator and diffuser.
<p>
 <li>The green (532 nm) beam exits from the hole in the upper right. 
  The 1,064 nm beam exits from the hole in the lower right.  (Right and left
  holes looking from the front of the laser head, these may be interchanged
  based on the locations of the beam monitoring photodiodes and locations
  of other components, I'm trying to confirm.)  The center hole is not used.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
The initial beam path is from the pump diode through the GRIN lens
to the NPRO input face.  The fundamental 1,064 nm beam exits at
approximately 90 degrees from the pump beam (up) and goes to the
three optics at the upper left of the photo, which split off a small
portion for the 1,064 nm photodiode ("Crystal Photo Mon").  One of
the optics is a filter to block 808 nm pump light from
the photodiode.  The remainder is redirected to the right and split
again for the doubler and 1,064 nm output.  The one optic that looks
like a laser mirror with the purplish tinge is probably used to focus
the 1,064 beam into the doubler.  The green output from the doubler
exits at approximately 90 degrees from the 1,064 nm input (going to
the right).  A small amount is split off for the "Green Pwr" photodiode.
The functions of some of the other optics are still unclear, though
most are probably baffles or beam stops.
<p>
While the internal alignment of the monolithic NPRO and doubler cavities
won't change, the relationship of the output of the NPRO to the input of
the doubler is a rather long path - something like 8 inches!  So, it
would seem that even the slightest thermal change in the ceramic substrate
could affect that alignment resulting in a change in coupling efficiency
and output power.  This may indeed be what I and others have seen with as
these lasers warm up, even with what should be very adequate cooling.
<p>
The dual wavelength option adds some complexity to the beam handling
optics but possibly not all that much.  But it is quite rare and was
discontinued due to lack of sales.  Perhaps only 1 out of hundreds
of these lasers will have it.  But even with the extra output, there
still seem to be way too many of those little random optics pieces!
<p>
I haven't yet peered inside of a normal LWE-142 but see
<A HREF="lwe142d2.gif">Possible LWE-142 Single Wavelength
Green (532 nm) DPSS Laser Optical
Layout</A> for how the beam path probably looks, minimizing the differences
compared to the dual wavelength laser.  Several optics related to the
output beam paths are totally eliminated while others are trivially
repositioned to reflect :) the central location of the output aperture
in the single wavelength laser.  Except for BS3 being replaced with
TM2, the labeling of the optics with the same function remains the same.
And the core NPRO and doubler beam paths are totally untouched
in position, type, and function.  Of course, the IR-only LWE-125
(fiber-coupled) and LWE-126 (free-space) lasers available in both
1,024 and 1,319 nm flavors would be even simpler!

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142o">Organization of the LWE-142 Controller</A></h3>

All of the control functions for the Model 142 (and other
Lightwave NPRO lasers) are contained in the laser head with the only
required input being DC power.  While no detailed documentation is
available for what's inside the laser head, the organization of the
control electronics - or at least one possible organization - can be
deduced from the laser's requirements and behavior.
See <A HREF="lwe142e1.gif">Possible LWE-142 Green (532 nm) DPSS Laser
Controller Organization</A>.  This would apply to both single and dual
wavelength LWE-142s.  Of course, there may be
differences in the actual partitioning.  For example, the various digital
components may be inside a smaller number of standard ICs or a PLA.
Or, both TEC drivers may simply be power amplifiers with the firmware doing
most of the work.  I have included a photodiode for the "Diode Photo Mon"
as it's listed on the main "S" screen.  However, the circuit appears
to be missing on my laser and others I know of since the reading is usually
0.00 or might twitch from time-to-time.
<p>
The controllers for IR-only Lightwave NPRO lasers like the Model 125/126
would be even simpler since there is no frequency doubler.  So, the Doubler
Temperature and Green Pwr circuits would be unnecessary.  However, the Slow
Tuning input would then need to go either into the Muxed A/D so the firmware
can deal with it, or directly to the NPRO TEC Driver to be added in as a
temperature offset.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe142f">Testing and Firmware Adjustment of LWE-142 Lasers</A></h3>

The following will restore a basically healthy LWE-142 in an unknown
condition to operation at the rated power or as much power as is easily
possible.  It can be performed entirely using the RS232 interface without
opening the laser head but will NOT address electrical or optical problems.
The assumption is that either the locking parameters have been corrupted or
that the laser has become slightly tired from age and use.
<p>
As far as I am aware, no amount of parameter fiddling via the RS232 interface
can damage the laser.  There is no way to alter the two most critical
settings - those for pump diode current and doubler temperature - in this
manner since they can only be changed by pots inside the laser head.
The main risk is forgetting to record the original settings for the parameters
that were then changed at random meaning you'll have to go to Plan B. :)
<p>
In addition to the laser head, heatsink/fan, and power
supply, a laser power meter capable of measuring the output wavelength at up
to somewhat higher than maximum power will be needed to calibrate the
relationship of "Green Pwr" to "Prog Pwr" if it is not known.  And, a
terminal or PC with terminal emulation softwarewill be required to
access the firmware parameters via the RS232 port.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#scllwe142i">LWE-142 Operation Using the
RS232 Interface</A> to get set up.
<p>
IMPORTANT: The laser head MUST be mounted on a suitable heatsink with
adequate cooling both to prevent any possibility of overheating, as well
as to provide a stable temperature for the baseplate during the tests.
<p>
<b>Initial tests</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Start up the terminal emulator (or terminal) prior to applying power to
 the laser.
<p>
<li>Power up the laser and let it go through its initialization.  DO NOT
 touch the terminal or terminal emulator until the red LED on the laser
 head comes on (after about 4 minutes) since this would bypass the thermal
 stabilization part of the initialization and might result in locking
 behavior other than what would be normal from a cold start.
<p>
<li>Once the red LED comes on, go into the "S" screen and then the "G" screen
 of the firmware interface and wait to see if the laser will lock successfully.
 This may take up to another 6 minutes.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the laser locks successfully without more than a few green flashes
  prior to a ramp-up to the "Green Pwr" becoming equal to "Prog Pwr" without
  too much overshoot, no further action may be needed unless the actual output
  power isn't set at the desired value.
<p>
 <li>If the laser continuously flashes or ramps up to a "Green Pwr"
  approaching the "Prog Pwr" and then plummets to zero
  suddenly, without converging on a stable condition, adjustment of the
  locking parameters, or a reduction in "Prog Pwr" may be needed.
 </ul>
</ol>
<p>
These conditions are addressed in the following paragraphs.
<p>
<b>Stable lock - setting output power</b>
<p>
Determine the actual output power calibration by measuring the output power
using the laser power meter.  For a laser rated at 200 mW, either 2:1
(Actual:Reading) or 1:1 is likely.  I have not seen LWE-142s rated for
other output power but how it is set probably has something to do with
maximizing the available dynamic range subject to the constraint of the
"Prog Pwr" being an 8 bit number.
<p>
To adjust the output power, increment or decrement "Prog Pwr" slowly
while watching "Green Pwr".  If the laser is capable of achieving a higher
output power, it should climb to the new power and stabilize there.  For
a lower power, it will decline and stabilize.  Lightwave does not recommend
using a power setting above 100 percent or below 50 percent of the laser's
rated power.  Also, at very low power settings, other locking parameters
may need to be adjusted, and there is risk of locking on non-TEM00 modes
of the doubler resulting in a screwed up beam profile.
<p>
<b>Output power not achieved - reducing output power</b>
<p>
Where the output dies before the "Prog Pwr" can be achieved, simply reducing
the "Prog Pwr" may result in stable locking, albeit at slightly reduced power.
If your application can use an output power that is less than
90 percent of the peak power before lock is lost, then by far the easiest
approach is to simply set the "Prog Pwr" there and be done.  Where "Green Pwr"
increments slowly (i.e., 1 count per 2 or 3 seconds) as it approahes "Prog
Pwr" and doesn't reach it or overshoots by only 1 or 2 counts but loses lock,
this is by far the easiest solution.  The only likely cause besides something
like a tired old pump diode, would be that the "Diode Temp Setpoint" is
incorrect.  This can be adjusted on the "S" screen by peaking "Crystal
Photo Mon".
<p>
<b>Flashing and burping - restoring lost locking parameters</b>
<p>
Where the laser does not lock at all due to the locking parameters being
screwed up, the best course of action may be to start from a clean slate
of locking parameters.  Unfortunately, there isn't any command to reset
to factory defaults.  If the original test data sheet for the laser is
unavailable, the following approach should work.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Save the present set of parameters for the "S" and "G" screens by
 using the "Screen Snapshot" function of the terminal emulator, a digital
 camera, or pencil and paper. :)  That way, it will be possible to
 restore them if needed, or simply to have an idea of which ones differed
 greatly from the sample parameters to be used.
<p>
<li>On the "S" screen, the only relevant parameter that can be adjusted is
 the "Diode Temp Setpoint".  However, unless this was known to have been
 modified, it's probably best to leave it alone for now if the value looks
 reasonable (10 to 25 &deg;C).  Changing it to the sample setting isn't
 likely to do much good since each laser's pump diode will have a different
 optimal temperature.
<p>
<li>On the "G" screen, compare each parameter that can be changed starting
 with "Scan Fast Delta" and set it to the sample values shown in the section:
 <A HREF="laserscl.htm#scllwe142i">LWE-142 Operation Using the RS232
 Interface</A>.  These may not be optimal, but have been known to work with
 minimal changes on multiple LWE-142 lasers and should be a good starting
 point.  Once they have all been entered, the random green flashing that
 might have been present should cease and there should be some evidence of
 the laser attempting to lock.  Wait a few minutes to see if the
 laser now can lock at the desired "Prog Pwr" setting.  If it tries to lock
 but "Green Pwr" seems to be changing too quickly, reduce the "Slow Delta"
 from 4 to 1.   If it tries to lock by slowly ramping up toward the "Prog Pwr"
 but loses lock, then "Prog Pwr" may be too high.  Reducing "Prog Pwr" to a
 value slighly below where lock is lost, should now result in  successful
 locking.  Using 85 to 90 percent is probably best but with some fiddling
 of parameters, it may be possible to get somewhat closer.
<p>
 Performing a temperature scan via the "T" screen while monitoring the
 output power on the laser power meter is another way of determining how
 much output power is possible.
<p>
<li>Once the laser has successfully locked, the "Diode Temp Setpoint"  can
 be adjusted to maximize the "Crystal Photo Mon" reading.  It's best to do
 this adjustment with the laser is stable since it will fluctuate slightly
 during locking.  If the "Cystal Photo Mon" reading can be increased above
 its original value, more output power may be available as.  So, in this
 case if desired, go back and see if "Prog Pwr" can be increased.

<h2>Lightwave Electronics 221 DPSS Laser</h2>
<h3><A NAME="scllwe221d">Basic Description and Safety/Operation Issues
 Issues of the LWE-221</A></h3>

The Lightwave Electronics Model 221 is a high power DPSS Nd:YAG laser
capable of <i>10 W or more</i> output power at 1,064 nm.  (Lightwave
Electronics was teken over by JDS Uniphase.  This laser is no longer
manufactured.)  It is driven
by a compact lightweight power unit which plugs into normal 115 VAC.  It
can operate CW or may be amplitude modulated by an external input or
internal programmable frequency signal.  A separate chiller is
normally provided for closed-loop cooling.  The chiller interfaces to the
power unit which then controls the temperature of the recirculated water
and checks for fault conditions like water flow failure.  Some versions
have front panels on the control unit which enable the laser to be turned
on and off, and its operating parameters changed and monitored.
However, OEM versions (e.g., those that reside inside some
massive graphics arts machine) will not have any controls on the power
unit.  These can be set up to turn the laser on automatically after
power is applied (EEPROM settings and external and internal jumpers).  But
this doesn't permit any adjustments to be made and is definitely more
dangerous.  So, the preferred way of controlling front panel-less systems
is via the RS232 interface as described below.
<p>
Some photos of the Model 221 laser head inside and out along with description
can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lwe221/">The Lightwave
Electronics Model 221 DPSS YAG Laser Page</A>.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercds.htm#cdsshpd">Simon's High Power DPSS Laser Project and
Discussion</A> for some speculation on modifying this laser to generate
several watts of 532 nm green.
<p>
WARNING: The Model 221 is a Class IV Nd:YAG laser operating at 1,064 nm.  Its
output power can exceed 10 <i>WATTs</i> and the beam is very tight and highly
collimated.  Proper laser safety goggles (OD 6 or better at 1,064 nm) are a
must unless the beam is guaranteed to be totally enclosed.  Even a 1 percent
reflection can inflict instant eye damage, especially because it is IR and
totally invisible.  Multiple WATTs in a tight beam can also quickly set fire
to whatever gets in its way (ask a power cord I used to know!).  This is not
a whimpy 100 mW laser or 5 mW pointer!
<p>
CAUTION: Operation of the laser is via an RS232 interface (which is described
below), front panel controls (on some versions), or a remote pendant (which
is essentially a front panel on a tether).  Unlike the Coherent Compass
315M and 532 which are basically just turned on and off at a specified power
output and the controller does the rest, the LWE-221 uses a low level interface
with most parameters under user control.  While there is some degree of
protection from entering parameter values that will damage the laser, this
isn't foolproof and it is quite possible to specify a set of conditions that
will damage the laser diodes or at least shorten their life.  Thus, any
changes to operating parameters from those that were originally present
in the laser's EEPROM should be considered very carefully, especially any
that might increase laser diode current or alter their temperature setting.
If a Test Data Sheet didn't come with the laser, copy down or save a screen
shot of the parameter display for future reference before changing anything!
<p>
CAUTION: The laser diodes inside the laser head are connected directly to
two fat pins on the umbilical cable.  There is little protection for them
when the cable is not attached (e.g., no shorting relay).  Thus, extreme
care against ESD should be taken whenever the laser head is not attached
to the power unit.  Do not touch the pins without grounding yourself first.
Cover the cable connector with an antistatic bag before moving or shipping
the laser head.
<p>
CAUTION: Where no chiller is available (as may be the case when these lasers
are pulled from working equipment), tap water cooling can be used, at least
for testing.  However, water cooling in some form MUST be provided whenever
the laser diodes are actually powered (i.e., the laser is actually on)!
No cooling is needed when checking out the interface commands as long as
the laser diodes are not being driven with any current.  More information on
using the laser without a chiller may be found below.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221p">LWE-221 Power Unit</A></h3>

The Model 221 power unit provides the power supply for the high power laser
diodes, control of the chiller, monitoring of interlock and fault conditions,
and user interface either via a front panel control panel (some versions)
or pendant (assumed to be an option), or the RS232 connectors.  The OEM
version is described below.  This lacks a built-in control panel and is
assumed to be installed inside some piece of graphic arts equipment.
<p>
<b>Front panel</b>
<p>
All that is present on the front panel are a row of status LEDs and
RS232 port 2 (a DB9F connector).  The status LEDs are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<b>Power</b> - Indicates that AC power is on (switch on rear panel).
<p>
<b>CHLR EN</b> (Chiller Enable) - Chiller operation is enabled, no faults.
 This appears to be tied to the sensed water temperature.  Above a certain
 temperature, the chiller is turned on.
<p>
<b>L PS EN</b> (Laser Power Supply Enable) - Turns on when there are no
 fault conditions present.
<p>
<b>LASE EN</b> (Laser Enable) - Everything is enabled except laser diode
 power.
<p>
<b>DIOD ON</b> (Laser Diode On) - Current is flowing through the laser
 diodes.  ("Laser Diode" refers to all the laser diode bars inside the
 unit.  They cannot be controlled individually.)
<p>
<b>SHUT OP</b> (Shutter Open) - This indicates that the mechanical
 intra-cavity beam shutter is open.  (Thus the laser isn't lasing
 even if the Laser Diode is on until the shutter is open.)  The
 External Shutter 5 VDC must be applied as well as the Internal Shutter
 logic state being "OPEN" for the actual mechanical shutter to open.  The
 LED monitors the actual physical position of the shutter.
<p>
<b>OVR V</b> (Over Voltage) - Over voltage condition on the laser diodes,
 a major fault.
<p>
<b>OVR C</b> (Over Current) - Over current condition on the laser diodes,
 a major fault.
<p>
<b>CHLR FLT</b> (Chiller Fault) - Water reservoir level too low or no flow
 when flow is called for.
<p>
<b>HTEMP FLT</b> (High Temperature Fault) - Excessive temperature of the
 laser diodes.  This probably means whatever method of cooling is in use isn't
 working (like you forgot to open the valve!)
<p>
<b>CHLR ST</b> (Chiller Stable?, Chiller Status?) - This LED flashes periodically without
 any fault conditions detected but not sure what it means.  Manual says this
 indicated chiller is cooling.  Duh. :)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Rear Panel</b>
<p>
The major connectors and a set of DIP switches are on the rear of the power
unit:
<p>
<ul>
<b>AC Power</b> - There are actually two (2) power cords with IEC plugs.
 One is the normal low current type with an associated power switch (this IS
 the main AC power switch for the power unit).  The other requires a high
 current (notched) IEC plug and has no switch.  Why does this thing need
 two power cords???? :)  Manual says one is for the diode power supply and
 the other is for the controller itself.  Still, why does this thing need
 two power cords???? :)  WARNING: If removing the cover, unplug both power
 cords for safety!
<p>
<b>LASER</b> - This is a large AMP circular connector similar to those used
 on air-cooled ion lasers.  Indeed, an ion laser umbilical may work to
 attach the 221 laser head as long as the wires on pins 1 and 15 are
 fat enough and it includes all the connections used on the 221 connector
 - some do not.

<p>
 * Grounding /SH_OP which sits at about +24 VDC when inactive will open the
 shutter but I don't know if it is supposed to be ground - the resistance
 measured between /SH_OP and +24 V on the laser head is only 40 ohms implying
 a current of 0.6 A, which seems quite high for a small solenoid.
<p>
 The fuses in power supply for +24 V and -12 V are 2 A, 250 V.  These, as
 well as a third fuse (same ratings, not for laser head power), are obviously
 afterthoughts as they are ECOs added on the main PCB.
<p>
<b>Modulation</b> - Associated with the LASER connector is an SMA connector
 which provides the output signal to drive the AOM module inside the laser
 head which will either have a mating SMA connector or perhaps just a 3 pin
 header to which the cable attaches.  However, the SMA to 3 pin wiring
 is still a bit of an unknown.  It appears as though the center pin of the
 cable should go to either pin 1 or pin 3 of the header (possibly to select
 normal or inverted polarity) with pin 2 being the shield.  Then reversing
 the direction in which the plug is inserted would change polarity.  The
 resistance of pins 1 or 3 to ground is 110 ohms and tracing the wiring shows
 that the signal on pin 1 would eventually end up at the same place as the
 center of the SMA connector (if it was installed) though be a slightly
 different path.
<p>
 The output of the power unit SMA connector has levels of around 0 and +3 V
 (unloaded) so this may be TTL compatible or it may be much lower when
 properly terminated.  I think 0 V is the open (full power) level for normal
 polarity but  have not confirmed this as yet.  The actual RF driver for the
 AOM is inside the laser head.  (Its power output is 2.5 W at 200 MHz
 according to the specifications should you care.)
<p>
 The external modulation input to the power unit is applied as a differential
 TTL signal to pins 5 and 1 of the External Control connector (see below).
<p>
 The manual for the 221-1064-V04 doesn't have details of the modulation
 signals and doesn't have anything about the 3 pin header on the laser head.
 All references are to an SMA connector on the head. However, it has now
 been determined hot to get the AOM in the head to operate properly.  On
 the 3 pin connector, the top pin is the signal input and the middle pin
 is ground.  Leave the lower pin floating.  For more detailed information,
 see the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#scllwe221m">LWE-221 Modulation</A>.

<b>Chiller</b> - DB9M used for the chiller interface (described below).
<p>
<b>Emission Indicator</b> - Two pin connector outputs HIGH level when the
 laser is on and may be outputting a beam.  It is highly recommended that
 this be used to control a BIG RED LIGHT BULB so you know that the laser
 beam is on!
<p>
<b>RS232 Port 1</b> - DB9F used to communicate with a terminal, terminal
 emulator running on a PC, or a host computer (described below).

<p>
 * The laser will not generate or output a beam unless 5 VDC is applied
 between pins 7 and 8.  For basic operation in CW mode, the other pins
 can be ignored.  The 5 VDC drives a small relay that actually completes
 the solenoid circuit to open the shutter.  (The relay also tells the
 controller that the shutter should be open.)  It requires about 35 mA
 at 5 VDC (140 ohm coil resistance).  The physical shutter will not actually
 open until everything else is enabled including the Internal Shutter (but
 this appears to be the default state on power up).  However, it can be used
 to turn the beam on and off almost instantaneously at that point.  From my
 tests, pins 7 and 8 *only* go to the relay coil so polarity doesn't
 matter.  However, other versions of this laser may behave differently.
 The manual actually claims pin 8 is one of the grounds and just says
 +5 VDC is required on pin 7.  Not quite so for this power unit at
 least. :)
<p>
<b>DIP Switches</b> - Four switches with the following functions (from
 left to right facing the panel).  The only one that would seem to matter
 without a hardware control panel is Baud:
<p>
 <ul>
 <b>Set</b> - Toggle either up or down to save paremeter to EEPROM.<br>
 <b>Ser</b> - Toggle down to up to enter service menu.<br>
 <b>Min/Ex</b> - Service panel display range. (Down is Extended Mode.)<br>
 <b>Baud</b> Baud Rate for RS232 interfaces.  9600 is up; 1200 is down.
  Requires power cycling to change.
 </ul>
<p>
<b>Interlock</b> - Two pin connector must be jumpered to enable the laser
 to be turned on.  This is the main hardware interlock.
</ul>
<p>
Note: The specific version I have is labelled 221-HD-VO4.  Other versions
will differ somewhat.  For example, the -VO1 and -V02 versions may have
8 DIP switches and a full hardware control panel (among other variations).
<p>
<b>Fault Conditions</b>
<p>
The following conditions will force the laser into Standby mode.  Depending
on the version of the power unit and usage, error messages will appear on
the front panel display or LEDs, control pendant, or terminal:

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221f">LWE-221 Hardware Control Panel</A></h3>

I have obtained the loan of a hardware control panel for the 221-1064-V04.
It works more or less as described in the model 221 operation manual though
my manual is for the -V01 and -V02 so some small differences exist.  There are
4 buttons and a pair of 8 alphanumeric character single line displays.  Unlike
the control panel that would come as the front panel for the power unit, there
is no keyswitch or shutter switch but it is otherwise physically identical.
The two displays show various readouts or parameters depending on the laser's
mode (changed by pressing the MODE button), their state (changed by pressing
the DISPLAY buttons), and the position of two of the DIP switches
(Minimal, Extended, and Service functions) on the rear of the power unit.
A third DIP switch permits saving the values that were changed via the
control panel.  The KNOB (an incremental optical encoder) permits changing
the value of the displayed parameter (if permitted).  The STANDBY button
takes the laser into and out of Standby, turning the Laser Diode on and off.

</PRE>
<p>
The circuitry of the control panel is very simple - just a pair of Hewlett
Packard 8 character HDSP-2111 yellow display modules, the optical encoder
for the knob, 4 switches, and a half dozen discrete components.  The
connection is via a 40 pin ribbon cable which plugs into a socket on
the main PCB of the 221 power unit (inside).  It would be a simple matter
to duplicate this if desired.  I have traced the circuit for future
reference (see below).
<p>
However, I'm really not sure it is any more convenient to use the hardware
control panel than the RS232 interface with a terminal emulator.  And I
wouldn't suggest copying it for a software control panel running on a PC.  I'd
rather see a format similar to that of the full-screen display of the RS232
interface program but one that includes all possible parameters, with the
ability (depending on access level) specific subsets of them to be changed
using a mouse or cursor controls for selection.
<p>
The hardware control panel does permit incrementally changing at least one
parameter (internal modulation frequency) that I haven't yet figured out
how to set to an arbitrary value with the RS232 commands though.  But I
expect that there is a way and it will be found eventually!
<p>
Since few users are likely to have or really want the hardware control panel,
I don't presently intend to document its operation in any more detail unless
specifically asked.  However, since I already did the work, here is the wiring
of the hardware control panel PCB.  This was determined by buzzing out the PCB
for the unit I borrowed for the 221-1064-VO4.  I do not know if the other
versions are the same:

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221i">LWE-221 Operation Using the RS232 Interface</A></h3>

The following is mostly verbatim from the Lightwave operation manual
for the Model 221-HD-VOx series IR (1,064 nm) Nd:YAG CW
(amplitude modulatable) DPSS laser (henceforth called the "Model 221") but
should also apply to other similar Lightwave lasers.
<p>
<b>Laser Serial Interface</b>
<p>
The Model 221 can communicate through RS232 protocol on a DB9 female connector
at the edge of the power supply control PCB.  This connector has the same
pinout as the IBM PC.  The serial interface can be used for the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>In manufacturing to assist calibration.
<li>For field service with a terminal or PC.
<li>For field service via a modem.
<li>For host computer status and control.
<li>For remote operation of the laser.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Hardware and Hookups</b>
<p>
The DB9F RS232 connector on the rear of the power supply can be connected to a
serial port on a terminal, modem, or host computer.  (On the version of the
221 controller I have with no front panel controls, there is another DB9F
connector on the front panel which also responds to external commands.
However, the messages returned due to fault conditions may be subtly
different. --- Sam.)
<p>
This connector on the terminal, modem, or host computer is usually a 9 or 25
pin standard D-shell type.  On a terminal, the connector is usually labeled
"Modem".  On a PC, it is labeled "Serial Port".  The functions of the pins,
as related to the power unit, are given as:
<p>
<PRE>
    Pin        Symbol        Function
  -------------------------------------------------------------
     2          /RxD         Received Data (into Model 221)
     3          /TxD         Transmitted Data (from Model 221)
     5          /Gnd         Ground
     7          RTS          Request to Send
     8          CTS          Clear to Send
</PRE>
<p>
The DB9F RS232 connector on the rear of the power supply needs to be
connected to what is usually a 9 pin or 25 pin connector on the terminal or PC.
Note that pins 2 and 3 must be swapped between the Model 221 and PC.  A normal
RS232 extension cable will NOT work!  Once connected and powered up, double
check that this is correct by measuring the voltage between pin 5 (Gnd) and
pins 2 and 3 - they should both have a negative voltage on them of 6 volts
or more.  If one is close to 0 V, the swap isn't present or the wiring is
incorrect in some other way.
<p>
The interface of the Model 221 supports hardware handshake through the CTS
and RTS signals.  The model 221 will assert its RTS signal at all times.
When the incoming CTS is not asserted, the Model 221 will store message data
up to 256 characters.  If the CTS remains unasserted, new message data will
write over the oldest.  In normal operation, this condition is not expected
to occur.  (For use with a terminal or terminal emulator on a PC, RTS and
CTS can probably be ignored.  I have been using just the 3 pins 2, 3, and 5
for communications. --- Sam.)
<p>
<b>Communications Settings</b>
<p>
The following settings are needed for proper communications:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Baud rate: 9600 or 1200 (see below).
<li>Parity: None.
<li>Data bits: 8.
<li>Stop bits: 1.
<li>Duplex: Full.
</ul>
<p>
The Baud Rate DIP switch on the rear panel (far right) sets the laser's baud
rate.  For operation with a terminal or host computer, 9600 baud (up) is the
recommended rate.  With a modem, 1200 baud (down) is recommended.  The internal
microprocessor reads the Baud Rate DIP switch upon powerup.  Therefore,
the power supply must be turned off and then on again to change the baud
rate.  (Flipping the switch without power cycling will apparently change
the baud rate seen externally but not something inside so communications
doesn't work! --- Sam.)
<p>
<b>Screen Control</b>
<p>
Screen control commands are designed to be executed from the terminal or PC
terminal emulator.  The power supply sends information in a format compatible
with the Lear Siegler ADM-3A or Televideo 912 terminal.  Any terminal or
terminal emulator can be used that is compatible with these cursor controls.
(e.g., Televideo 925).  When using a terminal emulator on a PC, suitable
software will be needed.  Two options known to work are "Crosstalk
Communicator" and "Procomm Plus".  An ancient version of PCPLUS may be
downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lwe221/pcplus.zip">PCPLUS.ZIP</A>.  It
will run on any PC under DOS or in a DOS window under Win3.x/95/98, but
hung trying to run on WinME and WIN2000.  The fact that it's a 1988 DOS
program can't be an excuse to misbehave, can it? :)
<p>
<b>Status Display Command</b>
<p>
An "S" requests a display of the laser parameters screen.  The screen will be
updated every 2 seconds after pressing "S".  The displayed parameters appear on
the right side after the description but cannot be changed unless a password
is given to enable adjustment mode.  The password is: C##C.
<p>
The key strokes used to display or change these parameters are as follows:
<p>
<PRE>

  RETURN or ENTER   Moves the cursor down one item
  Ctrl-K            Moves the cursor up one item
  K                 Increments value of current item
  J                 Decrements value of current item
  S                 Updates screen
  Q                 Quits calibration procedure and saves current values
  Z                 Zeros displayed operation hours (another register
                     shows total hours - it can't be changed)
</PRE>
<p>
The screen display is approximately as follows (depends on specific revision
and whether if in adjustment mode or not):

<p>
<b>Remote Computer Control</b>
<p>
Control of selected parameters of the Model 221 may be accomplished through
the RS232 port.  The general protocol for Lightwave Electronics Corporation
lasers consists of fixed format ASCII command strings for both request and
response.  Note that depending on the particular version of the laser,
there may be some differences in command format and responses.
<p>
The Model 221 will not send strings except in response to requests or if
a fault is detected.

are in the manual for the VO4.  The Internal Shutter commands will only
affect the shutter if the External Shutter is enabled (5 VDC present on
pins 7 and 8 of the External Control connector) and appears to default to

* These commands not implemented on VO1 and VO2.  Some also may differ in
response format based on version.
<p>
The firmware which deals with the RS232 ports is not bug free.  Among other
things, it will ignore the "S" command to refresh the full screen display
after some incorrect ESC commands are received.  In addition, there
is the issue of the peculiar behavior for the Diode Operating Current as
described in a subsequent section.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221c">LWE-221 Operation Without a Chiller</A></h3>

If the Lightwave Electronics chiller or a compatible unit is available, then
it's just a matter of plugging its interface cable into the back of the
Model 221 power unit and hooking up the water lines.  However, where there
is no chiller, the power unit can easily be fooled into thinking one is
present so that tap water cooling (or a non-compatible chiller) can be used.
<p>
The interface is via a DB9M on the back of the power unit:

</PRE>
<p>
Constructing a DB9F plug as follows will keep the power unit happy:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Install a 10K ohm resistor between pins 5 and 7.  This will result in a
 sensed temperature of around 25 &deg;C and should allow the laser to power up.
<p>
<li>Jumper pins 2 and 3 to pin 8.  This will result in water flow and
 reservoir level being detected as satisfactory which will turn off the
 Chiller Fault indicator.
</ul>
<p>
Tap water cooling can then be used to maintain the temperature of the laser
diodes at the specified value.  A simple scheme to provide automatic
temperature regulation could then use a solenoid valve to control mixing of
hot and cold water.  Or, an aquarium pump could recirculate water through
the laser with a solenoid valve being used to add cold water as needed.
<p>
If the actual connections on the laser head aren't marked, the sex of
the quick-connect fittings indicates direction.  The laser will operate
with the water direction reversed but the temperature setpoint may be a
bit different.
<p>
CAUTION: According to the manual, water pressure for the laser head must be
less than 1.5 psi.  Some sort of overpressure protection is highly
recommended.  This isn't an issue if an aquarium pump is used for water
circulation.  But if tap water cooling is used, inlet pressure can be 30 psi
or more.  A "T" fitting with a balloon hanging off the side port would
probably be adequate.
<p>
Note that the quick connect fittings that come with the laser have built in
valves to close off the lines when disconnected to minimize spillage.  If
using an incompatible means of attaching the water lines like rubber tubing
and hose clamps, the quick connect fittings should be removed entirely even
if attaching to them is possible.  It's particularly critical to never get
into a situation where the inlet pipe is open and the outlet pipe is
accidentally closed especially if there is no overpressure protection
because full water pressure could end up inside the laser head.  While
I believe that the plumbing inside the laser head really can withstand
relatively high pressure, you don't want to find out the hard way that
it cannot handle more than 1.5 psi!  Actually, I think and have been told
that all internal connections are welded or otherwise joined in a very
robust manner.  So, the 1.5 psi max rating must be to prevent external
hoses from flying apart or something. :)  However, to be sure, before
actually connecting to the water supply, blow into the inlet to confirm
that the lines are clear.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221m">LWE-221 Modulation</A></h3>

Some of these lasers come with the proper interconnecting cable from the
power unit to the laser head.  However, this is often not the case.
Where they are both SMA connectors, the proper cable should be obvious.
However, on the LWE-221-V04 (and possibly others), the wiring is not obvious.
The following is known to apply to the LWE-221-V04 *only*.  For this laser,
there is a 3 pin AMP connector on the laser head and an SMA connector on
the power unit.
<p>
(From: Gary (gary@legacytechgroup.com).)
<p>
We have been successful at
getting the AOM to modulate the beam.  As advertised, the AOM will only
deflect about 80% of the beam, letting the rest through.  Yet the
electronics are surprisingly fast and it appears that getting the beam to
pulse at widths short as 50 ns is possible.  We are including the following
few paragraphs that might be helpful to those who are thinking of
modulating the beam on these lasers:
<p>
The manual that comes with the LWE-221-HD-V04 laser only mentions the
ability of the laser to be pulsed and provides very little help in
the way of telling you how to actually do it.  The laser head has an
internal extra-cavity Acoustic Optical Modulator (AOM) good for
deflecting about 80% of the beam into a beam dump inside the laser
head.  This is NOT a Q-switch,  and can only be used to modulate the
beam between 20% and 100% of full intensity.  The RF driver for the
AOM is located in the laser head and can be switched on and off via a
three pin connector that is located on top of the back of the laser
head.  The top-most pin (1) is the trigger pin.  It should be
connected to the middle of the SMA connector located on the power
supply.  The middle pin (2) should be connected to shield ground.  We
used a home-built SMA connector and RG 194 cable soldered to a 3-pin
connector to connect the power supply to this connector.  The
function of the third pin (3) is a bit more mysterious; if grounded,
it turns on the AOM, if at 3 V it still turns on the AOM.  If this pin
is left floating, then trigger control in turned over to pin (1).  We
just left pin (3) unconnected:
<p>
<PRE>
  Pin    Function/Comments
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   1     Trigger pin (3 V = on) -> Middle of SMA
   2     Shield Ground -> Shield of RG 194
   3     Leave floating (not connected). Forces AOM "on" if grounded
</PRE>
<p>
The power supply sends a 3 V signal (on) or ground (off) with a rise time
of about 7 ns to the laser head to activate the AOM.  The AOM rise time
is about 12 ns according to the AOM schematic.  The trick is now to get
the power supply to trigger the AOM.  For some reason, the information
needed to switch the laser between (1) CW mode, (2) Internal Trig mode,
(3) External Trig mode and (4) Burst Mode is omitted from the manuals
for V04.  For this we used an ASCII terminal (an old version of DOS
Procomm plus 2.01) in ADM-3A terminal mode (FDX 9600 N81) connected to
the RS232 connector on the back side of the laser.  Thanks to help from
Sam's Laser FAQ and elsewhere, we found that sending the Following commands
from the terminal will switch the modes:
<p>
<PRE>
   ESC 09Q1 Enter Enter -> CW mode
   ESC 09Q2 Enter Enter -> Internal Pulse (square wave)
   ESC 09Q3 Enter Enter -> External Trig
   ESC 09Q4 Enter Enter -> Burst mode
</PRE>
<p>
Internal pulse mode sends a square wave modulation at the frequency
determined by the "R" value to the laser AOM.  This can be set as follows:
<p>
<PRE>
 ESC 09Rwxyz Enter Enter
</PRE>
<p>
where w is the power of 10 and xyz the significant figures.
<p>
For example:
<p>
<PRE>
   ESC 09R1000 Enter Enter -> 10 Hz
   ESC 09R2322 Enter Enter -> 322 Hz
   ESC 09R3210 Enter Enter -> 2.1 kHz

<p>
The External Trigger mode (3) lets the the AOM be activated by the state
of pins (1) and (5) from the 10-pin connector on the back of the power
supply (caution--the pin numbering scheme for these pins is not
conventional; from the left of the power supply 1st row they are
9,7,5,3,1; bottom row 10,8,6,4,2 (the bottom row is all connected to
ground).  If the TTL state of  pin 1 is High and pin 5 Low, the AOM will
be activated.  The other way around (1 Low and 5 High) will cause the AOM
to be switched off.  Since the HP 8015A pulse generator we have has
complementary outputs, we used these to control the pulsing.  Another
scheme might be to use high speed flip-flops to generate the complementary
signals needed.
<p>
With a scope on the electronics, we verified that could get pulse
widths as small as 20 ns with little distortion.  Our optical diodes,
however, were not fast enough to "see" the pulses directly in order
to verify that we were actually getting such a narrow pulse from the
laser beam itself.  The pulse was probably not that short.  We saw
the average intensity of the beam decrease linearly with the pulse
width (pulse repetition rates at 500 ns apart) down to about a 50 ns
pulse, at which time the beam intensity actually increased as the
width was further decreased.  Something is funny at widths below
50 ns.  Well, there you have it.  We didn't test out the Burst mode
functions, we will leave that to someone else...

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221s">LWE-221 Startup Checklist/Procedure</A></h3>

This section applies directly to an LWE-221 laser head attached to an LWE-221
power unit controlled via a terminal or terminal emulator through the RS232
port.  It is also based specifically on the version of the LWE-221 that I
have tested (221-1064-V04).  Another version may behave slightly differently.
In addition, if the laser's state saved in EEPROM differs from the default in
terms of modulation (CW), or LL (Std), and possibly some other parameters,
there may be additional steps required to turn the beam on or obtain full
power.  For example, someone before you may have set the laser up in one
of the modulation modes (Internal or External) rather than CW.  Double check
the values of all parameters before attempting to turn on the Laser Diode
or output a beam!
<p>
The following assumes that the laser output is actually turned on and
off by controlling the 5 VDC for Shutter On via the External Control
connector.  (This 5 VDC operates a relay and must be provided from an
external power supply.)  While this probably isn't a good idea for millions of
cycles (being a mechanical solenoid!), its use when powering up or down,
when changing the external optical configuration, or other relatively
infrequent control should be fine.  However, where safety with respect to
the beam is concerned, turning off the entire laser is even better!
<p>
Except for the obvious, the order of the items in this checklist is
not important:
<p>
<ul>
<li>221 power unit attached to compatible 221 laser head.
<p>
<li>Both cords of 221 power unit (and chiller if used) plugged into live
 115 VAC outlet.
<p>
<li>CDRH Interlock jumper installed on rear of 221 power unit.
<p>
<li>Chiller turned on or cheater plug installed with other source of flowing
 tap water adjusted to temperature slightly lower than diode temperature
 setpoint.
<p>
<li>ADI-3A or Televideo 912 compatible terminal or PC running terminal
 emulator attached to RS232 port (either port is probably fine).
<p>
<li>221 power unit turned on and initialized without error.  This takes about
 30 seconds during which it will buffer RS232 input but only respond to
 commands and update the display once initalization is complete).
<p>
<li>S typed on terminal or PC to bring up screen display.
<p>
<li>Laser Diode current setting confirmed to be below maximum.
<p>
<li>Beam path terminated into a proper beam stop.
<p>
<li>Laser safety goggles on head - yours, not the laser's! - unless beam path
 absolutely fully enclosed.
</ul>
<p>
The laser is now in Standby mode with cooling but the laser diodes are off.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Execute the Laser Diode On command via the terminal or PC (6 keystrokes,
 &lt;ESC>026&lt;CR>&lt;CR>)! After a very short delay, there should be an
 acknowledgement that the command was successful.  This will result in the
 laser leaving Standby mode.  (Note that there are actually several laser
 diode bars inside but they are collectivly called the "Laser Diode" by
 Lightwave and cannot be controlled individually.)  Be ready with the Laser
 Diode Off command, &lt;ESC>026&lt;CR>&lt;CR>, or be ready to pull the\
 interlock plug if there is any hint that something bad is happening.
<p>
<li>If the cooling system isn't temperature regulated, monitor the diode
 temperature and adjust the flow rate and/or temperature of the water
 to get close to the setpoint value.  A degree or two either way is
 fine for testing and even operating the laser for extended perioed.
 However, maximum efficiency (and lowest Laser Diode current for a
 given output power) may only occur quite close to the setpoint value.
</ul>
<p>
At this point, the laser is ready to fire up only awaiting the 5 VDC to
on pins 7 and 8 of the External Control connector to open the shutter.
The Power, CHLR EN, L PS EN, LASE EN, and DIOD ON, LEDs should be on, all
fault LEDs should be off except possibly for CHLR ST which may go on for a
few seconds occasionally (I don't know what it means).  The SHUT OP LED
should be off.  IF IT IS NOT, THERE WILL BE A BEAM - POWER DOWN IMMEDIATELY
BEFORE IT SETS FIRE TO SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T EXPECT THIS!!!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Once the laser diode has been on for a few seconds, the shutter
 will respond almost instantaneously to the external 5 VDC power to
 the Shutter Open relay.  This appears to be a good way of turning the
 beam on and off without affecting anything else or forcing the laser
 into Standby mode.  I have wired up a very hard-to-push pushbutton for
 this purpose.  However, as noted, being a mechanical solenoid, this
 should be limited to manual control and not used for high repetition
 rate blanking!
</ul>
<p>
Note that the internal power monitor of the LWE-221 does not operate
unless the shutter is open.  This is because the shutter is actually
<i>inside</i> the laser cavity and prevents lasing when closed.  With
the Shutter open, the power monitor reading will climb to a stable
value (assuming the laser is running in CW mode) after a few seconds.
The calibration appears to be 1 unit/10 mW of output power (probably
accurate to within +/- 10 percent or so).  As an example, an output
of 7.5 watts will read as 750 on the terminal display.  In the default
configuration, the laser will operate in constant power mode to maintain
the specified power.  Thus, Laser Diode current may fluctuate and will
generally not be exactly the default Diode Current shown on the terminal
display at powerup.
<p>
IF THE LASER DOESN'T BEHAVE AS EXPECTED, POWER DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND
FIND OUT WHY!  Among the settings not shown on the full screen display
that could prevent lasing at the expected power are the Internal
Shutter state being set to Closed, the modulation being in a mode other
than CW, and the LL (Light Loop) being Off instead of Std/On.
These could have been saved to the EEPROM by you accidentally or a
previous owner.
<p>
In principle, powerup to the output of a laser beam can be set to be
done fully automatically by changing an internal jumper and providing
power to the Shutter relay but as noted above, I don't recommend it
mainly for safety reasons.
<p>
Power down by closing the Shutter, and turning off the Laser Diode,
water flow/chiller, and 221 power unit.
<p>
WARNING: Regardless of how the beam is controlled, provide a fail safe
means of turning it off in an emergency and forcing the laser to
Standby mode so that an explicit command is required to re-enable it.
The RS232 interface via a terminal is not reliable enough as commands
can easily be mistyped.  Shutter control is also not desirable by
itself since it doesn't force Standby mode.  However, closing the
shutter by removing the 5 VDC from pins 7 and 8 of the External
Control connector would add a level of redundancy when used in
conjunction with any of the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Disable CDRH Interlock.  (Remove jumper or open circuit.)
<li>Force External Standby.  (Ground pin 9 of External Control connector.)
<li>Force any fault.  (These include chiller temperature or no flow.)
</ol>
<p>
A BIG red panic button would be perfect!
<p>
Removing AC power is of course guaranteed to work but may be potentially
damaging to the laser.  (Lightwave recommends againt killing power
without first turning off the Laser Diode but also says it shouldn't hurt
anything.)  Short of this, combining (1) with Shutter control is nearly
as good.

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221l">LWE-221 Lasing Experiences and Comments</A></h3>

This section summarizes my experience in actually getting a beam.
Except for the hole in the power cord, things went more or less
smoothly.  Remind me not to leave a power cord between the laser and
beam stop in the future. :)
<p>
The hardest part was determining that the shutter enable signal isn't a
logic level but actually drives a relay and the other side of the relay
coil isn't ground but an undocumented pin on the External Control
connector.  Well, the operation manual sort of says that it should be
+5 VDC to ground and that pins 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are ground but NOT
that both relay pins (7 and 8) are totally isolated and that pin 8 would
have to be jumpered externally to ground!  I had to remove the main PCB of
the power unit to trace the circuit.  Perhaps, the version of the
laser described in the manual does have pin 8 grounded internally.
<p>
There were a few minutes of panic after I accidentally shorted +24 to
ground in attempting to force the shutter open by bypassing the relay.
This blew a PCB-mounted fuse but caused no other damage.  There are
3 SMT fuses (one of which is on the bottom side of the PCB!).  All appear
to be afterthoughts - trace cuts and solder!  Opening the shutter
by any means other than the relay from the External Control connector
won't work in any case because the controller senses the
inconsistency of the Shutter Open state compared to the actual
position of the shutter (there is a logic signal returned from
the laser head for this) and forces the Laser Diode off.
<p>
In fact, powering it up really comes down to providing cooling, turning
on the power supply, turning on the laser diodes, and opening the
shutter.  (However, note that this assumes the state of the laser stored
in its EEPROM is the same as the unit I tested.  This is probably the default
but could be changed via the hardware control panel or remote pendant, or
RS232 interface.)
<p>
My cooling consists of a hose connection to a wash basin tap with the
flow adjusted so that the temperature stabilizes near the desired
setpoint with the Laser Diode on.  For the cold water around here in
Winter, a trickle is all that is needed.  This works quite nicely
until someone flushes a toilet. :)
<p>
I'm using a laptop running PCPLUS as the terminal for the RS232 port.
Providing AC power takes care of everything except turning on the
Laser Diode - that requires a keyboard command.
<p>
For the External Shutter control, I wired a 5 VDC regulated AC adapter
in series with a very hard-to-push pushbutton switch.  This must be
depressed for a beam to be produced.  Even if the switch is on, the
Internal Shutter command may be used to close or reopen the shutter
as long as the External Shutter 5 VDC is present.  But removing it
will instantly force the shutter closed.
<p>
The internal power monitor reads 748 and is very stable after an initial
fluctuation after opening the shutter.  The controller is operating in
constant power mode, confirmed by the behavior of the "Diode
Operating Current".  I originally assumed this to be a constant user
parameter, but it changes on its own once the Laser Diode is turned
on.  For example, on my unit, the listed current is 22 A.  But once the
Laser Diode is on, the displayed current changes to 21.6 A.  This
must be a value automatically selected to be just slightly lower than the
default entry to use as a starting point.  The same thing happens if
the default is changed to 20 A - the current changes to 19.6 A.
Then, once the shutter is opened, the laser is lasing, and the power
can be monitored, the current increases to around 23.5 A and
fluctuates slightly.  Possibly the laser diodes are a bit weak
(this unit has 3220 hours on it) or possibly some tweaking of
the cooling will reduce the current requirements.  Or, just as
likely, the default value had been selected to be a bit lower
than the actual operating current.  I don't have the original
test data sheet for this laser so there is no way to know for sure.
<p>
The beam produces a nice white hot spot on a brick that I'm using as a
beam stop!
<p>
My meat thermometer power meter (it's a commercial unit, not one I
cobbled together!) reads just over 7.5 W which agrees closely with
the 750 setting and the 748 reading of the internal power monitor
assuming it's actually calibrated as 10 mW/unit.  Since I found the
Power Setting command (U), it should be a simple matter to increase
it as long as the Laser Diode maximum current rating isn't exceeded. :)
My guess is that the discrepancy between the power setpoint of 750 and
the monitored power of 748 is due to the resolution of the power monitor
A/D.  If it is only 8 bits as is likely, there is a possible error of +/-2
counts in the units digit with only 256 levels being used to represent
values up to 1,000.  In fact, if the power setpoint is increased to 752,
the monitored power alternates between 748 and 752.
<p>
I would expect that 10 W of output power is achievable within the maximum
diode current limits though running at that power level continuously may
not be recommended.  It doesn't take very long to pop a balloon. :)
<p>
And along the lines of incandescent glowing bricks and balloon popping
at long distances:
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
The LWE-221 will certainly do very well in the backyard or beyond. It
has a very well-collimated beam of 2 mm diameter at the output. So far,
ours (-V01, 10 W CW) has already burnt a few holes in my shirt and some
special material which was supposed to be used for our safety curtains.
The sales rep was very impressed when it burned through in less then 2
seconds. He went away and said he would get back to us, which never
happened so that we do not have a curtain at all at the moment. :(
<p>
It also hurts very fast on skin. BTW, visible light is absorbed over a
few mm, that's why you need a bit more power to feel it. 1 micron is
absorbed right at the surface of the skin and hurts with much lower
power.
<p>
Anyway, when we had visitors, one of them put our IR viewer back onto
the table right in front of our table. I grabbed her hand, because I
was worried she would burn herself, so the viewer was only in the beam
for far less then a second. It has a very clear burn mark in the black
plastic now (and produced quite a bit of smoke). I never tried a
balloon though. Maybe I should do it, it would be good fun for the
students.
<p>
I guess that the 221 will actually perform better then a 60 W CO2 laser
on long distances, because of the better beam parameters. :)
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I just hope everyone wears proper laser safety goggles!  Power cords,
bricks, shirts, IR viewer cases, and safety curtains aren't the only
things that can suffer!

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221b">LWE-221 Bugs/Features/Questions/Observations</A></h3>

There are a number of issues with respect to the LWE-221 that aren't
covered in the manual.  In part this is because it doesn't cover the
version of the laser I have (-V04).  However, some are definitely
in the "bug" category.  The most serious of these deals with the
adjustment of Laser Diode current via the on-screen terminal interface:
Initially after power is applied, the increment/decrement goes in steps
of about 0.15 A.  But after the Laser Diode has been turned on, the step
size changes to 0.01 A.  More troubling, whenever a change is made, the
display momentarily flashes 40 A!  And I've seen the display actually
show 40 A with the laser diodes turned on!!  I don't think the current
was actually 40 A but I didn't leave it on long enough to find out!
<p>
It would be nice to know if this is a firmware bug or feature. :) :(
There are some other rough edges to the RS232 interface but this is
the only one that is potentially damaging.
<p>
There are also a several other open questions and observations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>There is a command "LL" which toggles between "Off" and "Std" via the
 RS232 interface.  This is ASCII code V via the RS232 interface but can
 also be accessed via the hardware control panel (if present).  From the
 hardware control panel, it toggles between "Off" and "On".  With LL Std
 or On selected, the laser behaves normally with the output coming up to
 full power in a fraction of a second when the shutter is opened and quickly
 stabilizing at the set power level.  However, with LL Off, the power climbs
 very very slowly (I don't know if it ever achieves the selected power) and
 the current readout remains unchanged at its previous value.  What does LL
 mean?  LL stands for "Light Loop" but that doesn't make sense when
 off since then I'd expect the output power to correspond to whatever it
 should be with the fixed Diode Operating Current.  This option is not
 present in the -V01 and -V02 versions of the 221 laser and the -V04 manual
 isn't all that clear.
<p>
<li>For the Internal Modulation mode, the RS232 commands can only set the
 rate to a power of ten multiple of 9.99 Hz (1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
 100,000).  The hardware control panel allows the value to be incremented
 or decremented via the knob but no similar command seems to work from
 the terminal.
<p>
<li>How is the modulation output from the power unit supposed to connect
 to the laser head?  Since I don't have the original modulation cable
 I took the back cover off the laser head and removed the small PCBs in
 an effort to determine this.  On the -V01 laser, there are
 SMA connectors at both ends.  However, on the -V04, there is an SMA
 connector at the power unit but only a 3 pin header at the laser head.
 The 3 pin RF connector is near where the SMA connector would be  on the
 PCB inside the laser head (there's a spot for it), but doesn't use the
 same pads.  It looks like pin 1 ultimately goes to the same place as the
 center of the SMA would, except through a different set of resistors.
 Although, success has been reported in getting the laser to be modulated,
 the exact functions of the pins, particularly pin 3 (bottom) is a mystery.
<p>
<li>I also found something interesting in my unit - a burnt-to-a-crisp
 part across the Laser Diode.  It is marked "D1" so I assume *was*
 a reverse polarity protection diode.  How it got blown is a real
 mystery though - possibly it was installed backwards (no way to
 know now - it crumbled to nothing) and blew when current was first
 applied.  Except for the smoke, such an event would likely go
 unoticed.  (BTW, in addition to D1, there are also a 1K ohm resistor
 and capacitor across the Laser Diode so it's not <i>totally</i>
 unprotected - or was.)  For the time being at least I haven't
 replaced D1.  While there is plenty of space, there isn't anything
 left to conveniently solder a new diode except the actual stubs
 through the PCB from inside laser head.  I would assume that the
 only function would be to prevent stupid mistakes - though it's
 basically impossible to get the connections backwards due to
 cable lengths.
<p>
<li>There is something else I didn't expect: The cable connections to
 the laser diodes are not screwed or soldered - they just plug in
 and while there is no way they could wiggle free, they seem really
 loose.  The sockets have a strange cage affair with fine gold plated
 wires surrounding a hole into which a gold plated post fits.  But
 there is absolutely no evidence of overheating or arcing so this
 scheme must work.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="scllwe221x">Green Conversion of LWE-221?</A></h3>

For this to be a desirable laser for many people, it's output would have
to be green rather than IR.  A 10 W 1,064 nm IR laser can probably produce
3 to 5 W of green when doubled to 532 nm.  Is it possible to convert
this laser to green?  Is it practical?
<p>
The simple answer is yes and not really.  At least, not easily.  There are
several problems:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Location and beam waist size for doubling crystal:</b> In order to
 achieve efficient doubling, the beam diameter inside the non-linear crystal
 (i.e., KTP) should be very small to maximize power density.  There is no
 such location present in an unmodified LWE-221 so some optics would need
 to be changed and/or added to focus the beam inside the KTP.
<p>
<li><b>Resonator configuration:</b> The LWE-221 uses a Fabry-Perot
 cavity design.  While this can and is used in many doubled lasers, they
 are mostly well under 1 W.  Higher power doubled lasers generally
 use a "L-fold" or "Z-fold" geometry which increases conversion efficiency
 and stability.  With these, nearly all the green light is confined to
 one arm of the "L" or "Z" so none is lost passing through the lasing
 medium.  The physical arrangement of the LWE-221 makes such a
 conversion rather challenging.
<p>
<li><b>Optics arrangement:</b> The KTP should be located near the
 output mirror to minimize optics that both IR and green need to pass
 through.
</ol>
<p>
In short, while these can be overcome, by the time all is said and done,
starting from scratch, possibly using only LWE-221 pump and rod may be
the best choice.  This topic was discussed extensively on the USENET
newsgroup <A HREF="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</A>.  A search via
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</A>
on the terms "lightwave laser green" will turn up more information than you
probably want.

<h2>Spectra-Physics ZLM Laser</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sclspzlmd">Basic Description and Safety/Operation Issues of the
 SP-ZLM</A></h3>

These are designed for applications like those of the Lightwave 221
described above.  Several watts (guessing up to 10) at 1,064 nm CW with
modulation capability.  The laser head is similar in appearance to
the Spectra-Physics Millenia series of DPSS lasers.  A large Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>
(vanadate) crystal is dual end-pumped by a pair of high power fiber-coupled
laser diode arrays in a remote power unit.  The only electrical connections to
the head are for a pair of acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) and the beam power
monitor and temperature sensors.  The head is water cooled.

<h3><A NAME="sclspzlmh">The SP-ZLM Laser Head</A></h3>
<h4><A NAME="sclspzlml">Description of the SP-ZLM Laser Head</A></h4>

The optical layout is shown in
<A HREF="zlmtop1.jpg">Spectra-Physics ZLM Laser Head - Top View</A>.
Cooling and electrical connections are shown in
<A HREF="zlmbot1.jpg">Spectra-Physics ZLM Laser Head - Bottom View</A>.
(Note: the second view has the unit rotated horizontally compared to the
first view.)
<p>
The laser resonator is a "Z-Fold" since the beam path is from the HR
mirror to Z-Fold Mirror 2 to Z-Fold Mirror 1 to the OC Mirror.  The
vanadate crystal is hidden by the gold plated circular mount.  The outputs
of a pair of high power fiber-coupled laser diode arrays are focussed into
the vanadate by the Pump Optics.  The only other parts inside the resonator
are a pair of intracavity stops (apertures).
<p>
Everything to the right of the OC mirror has to do with output beam shaping,
modulation, and output power monitoring.  There are two AOMs, each of
which feeds a beam dump with the wasted power during modulation.  All the
mirrors are on nice adjustable mounts (Newport quality) so alignment is
quite easy.
<p>
Apparently, the default state of AOM 1 is to block the beam entirely while
AOM 2 reduces its intensity by about 75 percent.  However, assuming the
AOMs won't be used, the mirror alignment can easily be adjusted to pass
the undeflected beam at near full intensity.
<p>
WARNING: The Model ZLM is a Class IV Nd:YAG laser operating at 1,064 nm.  Its
output power can exceed 10 <i>WATTs</i> and the beam is very tight and highly
collimated.  Proper laser safety goggles (OD 6 or better at 1,064 nm) are a
must unless the beam is guaranteed to be totally enclosed.  Even a 1 percent
reflection can inflict instant eye damage, especially because it is IR and
totally invisible.  Multiple WATTs in a tight beam can also quickly set fire
to whatever gets in its way (ask a power cord I used to know!).  This is not
a whimpy 100 mW laser or 5 mW pointer!
<p>
Until the operation of the mating power unit (SP-T40, see below) can be
determined, the following assumes drive and cooling of the pump diodes and
laser head are via user supplied equipment.

<h4><A NAME="sclspzlmp">Powering Up the Spectra-Physics ZLM Laser Head</A></h4>

The following assumes that a driver or drivers are available to power
the fiber-coupled pump diodes but that the Spectra-Physics power unit
(J40/J80/whatever) is NOT being used.  Depending on the specific diodes,
drive capability of up to 40 amps or more will be required for each one
(or in series).
<p>
<ol>
<li>The ZLM laser head can be pumped by 1 or 2 fiber coupled "FRU" laser
 diodes.  These typically have a maximum output power of 10 to 30 W through
 a ~1 mm fiber with 19 cores.  It may be possible to use other fibers as
 long as they have an FC style connector but you're on your own in that
 case.
<p>
<li>Cooling must be provided for the pump diodes.  Simple tap water
 cooling can be used but adding an intermediate TEC stage to actually
 regulate the temperature is best.  Each diode package has a 10K thermistor
 glued into the diode assembly that can be used for feedback.
<p>
 CAUTION: DO NOT allow the temperature to go low enough for condensation to
 form.  Some of these diode packages are not hermetically sealed.  Moisture can
 ruin high power diodes very instantly.
<p>
<li>Cooling must be provided for the ZLM laser head.  This can be tap water
 cooling and the water exiting the diodes, above, should be quite acceptable.
<p>
<li>If the AOMs are not being used, access to the interior of the laser head
 will be required to realign the beam path to pass the undeflected beam to
 the output.  In preparation for this, remove the 22 cover screws.  If
 you never expect to use the AOMs, it may be best to remove them entirely.
<p>
<li>PUT ON YOUR 1,064/808 nm LASER SAFETY GOGGLES!!!!
<p>
<li>With water flowing (just a bit over a trickle is sufficient as long as
 it can't accidentally be cut off if someone flushed a toilet!), ramp up
 the diode current to just above threshold and then increase slowly using
 an IR detector card or IR viewer or other means of detecting a beam at
 1,064 nm coming out of the OC Mirror to the right.  This should happen
 at most 1 or 2 W above the diode's lasing threshold (for a single diode,
 half this for both diodes running).  Adjust the diode current so there is
 just detectable light at 1,064 nm to use for alignment.  As the diodes
 heat up, you may have to increase current slightly to maintain lasing.
<p>
<li>The following procedure will realign two of the folding mirrors to
 enable most of the undeflected beam to exit the laser.  They can easily be
 returned to the original position should it be desirable to use the AOMs.
 However, it is probably a BAD idea to use the AOMs without doing this as the
 deflected beams won't hit the beam dumps but will go who knows where! :)
 Removing the AOMs entirely - also reversible but not quite as easy - would
 be even better and would guarantee that nearly all the light made it to
 the output.  The following alignment procedure is similar either way.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Once there is a beam, trace its path through AOM 1 reflecting off the
  folding mirror to its right (#1).
<p>
 <li>Place an IR card at the output aperture of the laser head and turn
  the *top* screw (only) on folding mirror 1 clockwise until there is a beam
  exiting the laser head.  It will take several turns of the screw.
  To test for this first without turning the screw, use a small screwdriver
  as a lever to push the top of the mount away from the base.  At some point,
  you should see the beam exiting the laser.  Fine tune the screw for maximum
  power and/or to center the beam in the output aperture.
<p>
 <li>Replace the cover just to keep out dust.
<p>
 <li>Turn the *top* screw (only, accessible from outside the case) of the
  upper left folding mirror (#2) clockwise until a stronger beam appears at the
  output aperture.  This is the one that is desired.  Fine tune the screw
  for maximum power and/or to center the beam in the output aperture.
<p>
  CAUTION: The adjusting screws for the HR Mirror mount are also accessible
  from outside the case at the far left.  DON'T touch them or you may be
  spending your whole day realigning the resonator!
<p>
 <li>This completes the alignment.  There should be no need to touch any
  other screws unless they have been messed up by someone else!
 </ul>
<p>
<li>It should now be safe to crank up the diode current and measure output
 power of the laser.  So far, I've only used a single whimpy diode that
 resulted in about 1.2 W of 1,064 nm output but I expect that with healthy
 diodes running at their rated power (typically 15 W each for this laser head),
 5 to 10 W of 1,064 nm output should be possible.

<h3><A NAME="sclspt40">Spectra-Physics T40 FCBar Laser Controller</h2>
<h4><A NAME="sclspt40d">Description of the SP-T40</A></h4>

This unit provides power and cooling for two Spectra-Physics Fiber-Coupled
laser diode bars (FCBars) each capable of 15 to 30 WATTs of output power
with 19 emitters into a multicore fiber optic cable.  I don't know exactly
all the laser head(s) the T40 normally drives, but laser it's part of is
used in a graphic arts (printing/platemaking) application like the
Lightwave model 221 laser.  The controller itself appears similar to
the one used for some of Spectra-Physics Millenia series of DPSS lasers.
<p>
I have a pair of units that appear to be functionally similar.  One (the
actual T40) includes a closed-loop Freon (R135) chiller while the other
uses water cooling.  They both have locations for two FCBar assemblies,
similar laser connectors and interlocks, an RS232 port, and a 4 line LCD
display.  There are no operator controls on the unit itself other than
a keylock switch to enable the laser.
<p>
The FCBar diodes on the T40 had their fibers cut.  Now, I consider that
an act of laserocide and want the perpetrators brought to justice. :)
The torn fiber ends were just poking out of its side.  I replaced one of
the FCBar units with one that is supposedly working, but weak, so at least
there should be some output from a proper fiber connector.
<p>
(From Ben Steigerwald.)
<p>
The T-40 contains 2 diodes, each of which is a 20 W, 19 emitter
bar, with a fiber coupling, the diodes produce a maximum of 13 W out of the
end of the fiber. The usual operating current for the diode is 20 to 24 A, and
is determined by the ROM chip on the diode board. The T-40 power supply
includes a 80 A 3.3 V Vicor flatpac and a pass-bank to power the pair of
diodes, each diode can be run at up to 30 A, though that power will begin to
damage the diode.
<p>
The power supply has a compressor on-board which runs constantly, so to
regulate the temperature of the diodes, it includes a heating pad in between
the diode and the compressor block. This means that the heater is countering
the cooling of the compressor. The diodes can be run at separate
temperatures. The refrigerant in the compressor is R134.
<p>
The "T-Series" power supplies come in several varieties, the single diode
unit, the T-20, is the  pump source for a system such as a VHP80-106Q or a
Millennia IIs or IIi. The T-40, is the common supply for a system using two
pump diodes at 20 W such as a 5 W Millennia or a ZLM. The T-80 is a very
uncommon system which was never officially released by Spectra Physics. It
uses 2 diodes which are 40 W each and produce approximately 28 W out the
fiber.  There is no standard laser using this now. The systems take the
same control signals, except for the T-20 which does not include the
control signals for the second diode.

<h4><A NAME="sclspt40p">Powering up the SP-T40</A></h4>

I have been able to power the T40 to the point of it waiting for a command to
turn on the FCBar diodes.  This only requires providing the proper
dummy plugs with jumpers for the CDRH interlock, remote, laser, and analog
interface connectors.  It goes through a boot sequence that lasts
about 5 minutes and then reports ready waiting for a command with diodes
off.  Any serious faults would result in an abort.  These include
a missing FCBar (the EEPROM is interrogated to determine operating
parameters), missing interlock (possibly even a change in the interlock
state during boot), and inability of the chiller to regulate the FCBar
temperature or temperature limits exceeded.  Surprisingly (and luckily), the
total lack of a laser head doesn't appear to be something the T40 cares much
about at all as long as the interlock jumper is present on the laser head
connector!
<p>
The following table lists the jumpers that were needed to enable the
boot sequence to complete successfully.  Not all of these will be present
on all versions of these controllers:
<p>
<PRE>
   Connector     Type                    Jumper
 -------------------------------------------------
   Interlock     AMP Mate-N-Lock 2 pin   1 to 2
   Remote        HD15                    8 to 13
   Laser Head    HD26                    9 to 18
   Analog        HD26                    7 to 8
</PRE>
<p>
The keylock also needs to be in the ON position to not report an error,
though I don't think this will abort the boot sequence unless possibly
it's changed during the boot.  Once complete, the keyswitch can be turned
on and off with the state simply changing from "Interlock Open" to
"Diodes Off" and "Ready Power Command".  (I may not have the wording
exactly correct as it's from memory).
<p>
With the boot completed successfully, I assume it's waiting patiently for a
command over the RS232 port or analog interface but I still don't have
any information on the details.  I attempted to communicate with the
RS232 port via a laptop running a terminal emulation program but there
was absolutely no response of any kind at any port setting, not even
jibberish.
<p>
There is also a wire labeled "24 V" hanging out of the unit.  It actually
has 115 VAC on it when the unit is powered on.  I have no idea of its
purpose but perhaps it is to drive an external power supply that then
needs to provide 24 V back to the T40 to enable something?
The LWE-221 laser controller requires an external source of 5 VDC to
enable it to actually produce a beam.  Perhaps this is similar.  But, if
so, where does the 24 V go?
<p>
If anyone has some answers, insight, or comments on these controllers,
please contact me via the

The T40 controller has the following pin numbers for RS232: Pin 2 is transmit
data (out from Millenia), pin 3 is receive data (in to Millenia), and
pin 5 is ground.  The format is: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit,
Xon/Xoff (do not use RTS/CTS setting).  The baud rate is selected by
S1 on laser head PCB:
<p>

  Position 1   Position 2   Baud Rate

      0            0        1200
      0            1        2400
      1            0        4800

<p>
On<CR> turns laser on.
<p>
Off<CR> turns laser off.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The DB9s are wired with pins 2, 3, and 5 connected as described
above and it was also confirmed that this was correct with respect to Tdata
and Rdata based on the voltages on their pins.  The On and Off commands were
completely ignored (assuming 9600 baud).  And, I cannot locate any "Laser
Head PCB" or DIP switches likely to be related to the RS232 port on any
other PCB.  The RS232 DB9, along with the Interlock, Laser Head, and
Remote connectors, is on a PCB labeled "T40 Controller" with no visible
DIP switches or jumpers.

<h2>Amoco DPSS Lasers</h2>

Sure, I bet you thought Amoco sold oil.  Apparently, they also made
a variety of DPSS lasers during some part of the 1980s and early 1990s.
Drilling oil wells must be a prerequisite for laser design. :)  "These
lasers lubricated with genuine light sweet crude". :)

<<h3><A NAME="sclamo1">Amoco 1,064 and 1,320 nm DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

The models I've seen are the 1064-150P and 1320-175W.  These are
physically similar with a chunky power unit attached to a compact
laser head.  The "1064" and "1320" are obviously the wavelengths and
I assume the "150" and "175" are output power in mW but have found no
specifications or even catalog listings.  I do have an old price
list - each system was around $18,000 (in 1990).
Typical samples are shown in <A HREF="amoco1.jpg">Amoco 1064 and 1230 nm
DPSS Lasers</A>.  The laser head in the front is the 1064-150P which
uses convection cooling.  The laser head in the rear is the 1320-175W.
It came with a small PC-style DC fan powered by a separate wall
adapter.  This is likely due to the pump current for the 1,320 nm
lasing line being much higher for the similar output power due to
its low gain.
<p>
The only user controls are a main power switch and keylock switch
to enable the laser.  An interlock plug
(1/8" phono-style, wired shorted) must be in place for the laser to operate.
There is no way to adjust power or monitor operation without
removing an end-panel.  The only indicators are LEDs for Power and
Laser On.  That's it.
<p>
For the 1,064 nm system, I have the mating power supply and laser head
(the serial numbers are the same).
Assuming that 150 is the rated output power in mW, mine is weak running at
about 65 mW.  However, with the temperature controlled laser head,
the power is quite stable.  I assume the cause of the low power is
that the pump diode and/or optics in the laser head have degraded
over time or with use.  It's unlikely anyone set it low deliberately.
<p>
For the 1,320 nm system, I don't have matching serial numbers.  It outputs
a stable 23 mW after adjusting the temperature (presumably of the pump
diode).  More on this below.  However, assuming the power supply had
been set up for a 1,064 nm system, it's likely the diode current is too
low since the 1,320 nm gain is much smaller than the 1,064 nm gain for
Nd:YAG.  The 1,320 nm laser head also has a fan, which the 1,064 nm laser
head lacks.  This, too, suggests a higher current for the pump diode.
<p>
Unfortunately, without any documentation, there is no nondestructive
way to know what the maximum safe current is to these laser heads.
So, increasing the pump current on either would be very risky. 
<p>
It took awhile to figure out how to get inside the power supply as there are
no visible fasteners.  It turns out that the end-plates are covered with
a thin plastic sheet which the labeling (what of it there is).  These are
held on by what is basically tough rubber cement.  The corners must be
carefully peeled back using a knife or razor blade just far enough to
reveal recessed screws at the corners.  On two of the three power supplies
I have, once these screws are removed, the end-plates come off easily.
However, on the third, there were 2 additional screws buried midway between
top and bottom and further toward the center.  Both end-plates must be
removed to take the thing to bits.  But only the end-plate with the keylock
switch and head connector needs to be removed to access the internal
trimpots, of which there are three in systems I have.
<p>
The functions of the "Current" and
"Temperature" trimpots are self evident, being pump diode current and
pump diode temperature, respectively.  CAUTION: I doubt there is any
current limit set elsewhere, so it's very likely that turning up the
current too much will blow the pump diode.
<p>
As expected, the pump diode temperature is rather critical.  Switching
between the 1064 nm and 1320 nm heads required changing it by at
least 5 turns!
<p>
The third trimpot is labeled "Heater", which I don't think does
anything for these model lasers.  There is also a part location for a "Photo"
trimpot, presumably to set the output power on a laser which uses optical
feedback to regulate output power.  But this feature is lacking on these
models.
<p>
Inside the power supply are a pair of PCBs mounted near the top and bottom
of the enclosure.  The upper one has a large heavy power transformer followed
by what looks like switchmode regulators.  The lower one (with the pots) has
the actual logic and control circuitry.  The small number of connections
between the PCBs and to the end-plates are via connectors.  While not
keyed or marked, most can only reasonably go together in one way.
But to be sure, it would be a good idea to draw a diagram of thier
arrangement.  Amoco appears to have been one of
these anal-retentive companies that attempted to make reverse engineering
difficult by painting over IC chip numbers.  They didn't do a particularly
effective job though, and many of the signals are actually labeled.
So developing a schematic for these systems shouldn't be totally impossible. :)
<p>
The aluminum end-plate has holes already predrilled to enable access to the
pots from outside.  All that's needed is to drill corresponding holes through
the plastic sheet covering them.
<p>
I have not determined how to get into the business-end of the laser heads.
popping off the nameplate at the rear reveals 3 screws and removing these
allows the connector and its mounting plate to be pulled free.  But that
simply plugs into a set of recessed socket pins buried deep inside.
I assume at this point that the front shutter ring has to be removed,
perhaps simply pried off to get to the guts, but so far have not used
excessive force to try that. :)

<<h3><A NAME="sclamo2">Amoco 532 nm DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

These are high quality lasers with a separate laser head and controller.
Brochures, spec sheets, and price lists for some Amoco lasers may be found
at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage Lasers
and Accessories</A>.
<p>
The one I tested is a 532-EH-50, rated at 50 mW minimum, dating from around
1993.  The EH brochure accessible via the link above only goes up to 20 mW
but Amoco would build higher power lasers to order. :)  It consists of
a nice solid laser head and somewhat beat up controller as shown in
<A HREF="am532eh1.jpg">Amoco 532-EH-50 Environmentally Hardened Green Light
Microlaser System</A>.  The "EH" stands for "Environmentally Hardened".
I wonder if that is just some O-ring seals to keep out bugs. :)
<p>
It came without the umbilical cable, just
a DB25M to DB25M with all pins wired straight through.  Someone must have
needed one for their PC modem. :)  "Hey, how about using the cable on this
$20,000 laser instead of going to the computer store?  I can save $5." :)
<p>
After I plugged it in and nothing except the power light and fan worked,
I was wondering if the cable was the only useful part.  But then I cycled
the keylock switch and the Laser indicator started flashing.  And 5 seconds
later, green output appeared and ramped up quickly to become dazzlingly
bright, measured at 54 mW, and rock stable.  The EH lasers are not
claimed to be Single Longitudinal Mode (SLM, or single frequency), but
testing with a Scanning Fabry Perot Interferometer (SFPI) shows that
this one appears to be very nice SLM.  The beam is clean TEM00 and
quite circular.  Nice little laser for something 16+ years of age.
Maybe there is something to be said for an oil company making lasers!
<p>
But let's hope it doesn't need to be adjusted.  Removing the bottom panel
on the front reveals 10 - count them - unlabled pots!

<h2>B&W Tek 532-10-OEM 10 mW DPSS Laser</A></h2>

<A HREF="http://www.bwtek.com/">B&W Tek</A>
is a manufacturer/supplier of a variety of lasers, laser systems,
Raman spectrometers, and other photonics-related equipment.  My first
contact with B&W Tek was when we bought a fiber-couple 980 nm 1 W laser
diode from them for research at Drexel U.  Later, I found a driver PCB
of theirs inside <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssleslp">The Edmund Scientific
Model L54-101 Green Laser Pointer</A>.
<p>
The 532-10-OEM is a cute little DPSS green laser system consisting of a
laser head and compact controller that runs on 5 VDC as shown in
<A HREF="bwtek1.jpg">B&W Tek 532-10-OEM Green DPSS Laser System</A>.
The laser head has TECs for the pump diode and crystal assembly and
the controller appears to run in constant current mode based on
behaviorm though this is not known for sure.  After a short warmup
period, the output settles down and is very stable.  These lasers
are TEM00 but are not spec'd to be single frequency, though I haven't
actually tested them in this regard.
<p>
There are 5 unmarked pots inside the 
<A HREF="bwtekcb1.jpg">B&W Tek 532-10-OEM DPSS Laser Controller</A>.
Three can be accounted for by assuming (1) pump diode current, (2) pump diode
temperature, and (3) crystal temperature.  But the function of the
other two is not known.  At least 2 of the pots have an immediate effect
on output power, which suggests that they are related to pump current.
But without documentation, I am reluctant to really experiment! :)

<h2>Laser Export Model LCM-DTL-374QT Q-switched UV DPSS Laser</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.laser-export.com">Laser Export</A> is a Russian
company that manufactures some fairly sophisticated DPSS lasers.
The LCM-DTL-374QT is an actively Q-switched frequency tripled diode
pumped Nd:YAG laser with an average pulse energy of 20 uJ, a pulse width
of 3 to 7 ns, and a repetition rate of 200 Hz to 1 kHz.  They have been
showing up on eBay dirt cheap, many of them actually working.  It consists
of a compact controller and laser head attached by a 15 pin umbilical
and separate RF cable for the Q-switch as shown in
<A HREF="lex374s1.jpg">Laser Export Model ACM-DTL-374AT DPSS Laser System</A>.
<p>
<A HREF="lex374h1.jpg">Interior View of Laser Export Model ACM-DTL-374AT
DPSS Laser Head</A> shows the arrangement of the optical components.
From left to right are the dual pump diodes combined in a polarizing
beam splitter, AO Q-switch, SHG (Second Harmonic (Generator) and SFM
(Sum Frequency Mixing) non-linear crystals, and output optics.
<p>
<A HREF="lex374c1.jpg">Interior View of Laser Export Model LCM-DTL-374QT
Laser Controller</A> shows the main PCB.  The Q-switch driver is a
self-contained module mounter underneath.
<p>
The laser is powered from 24 VDC and will free-run at 200 Hz but also
accepts a Q-switch trigger input up to 1 kHz.  It's not clear why the
repetition rate is limited to 1 kHz.  A Nd:YAG Q-switched laser using
a CW pump source should run at repetition rates up to 4 or 5 kHz
without any significant drop in pulse energy and linearly increasing
average power.  But possibly this is limited by the Q-switch driver
or power supply.
<p>
The LCM-DTL-374QT I have has a power supply problem.  With the nominal 24 VDC
power input, it flashes the error code for "power out of range".  At a bit
about 27 VDC (yes I risked it!), this error goes away and it starts flashing
the "thermal stabilizing" code, but never actually draws any significant
current or comes ready and never turns on the pump diodes.  So, some
independent circuit may think the voltage is too high, or there are a
combination of problems.  The laser head is almost certainly in good
condition, as is most of the power supply and the AO Q-switch driver module.
Although Laser Export is based in Moscow, most or all of the electronic
components are common types of Western manufacture and readily identifiable.
However, many of them are surface mount parts with some underneath the
main PCB so troubleshooting, especially without a schematic, would be
a challenge.  The problem is probably a single blown 5 cent part due to a
power spike! This laser is in excellent physical condition and rather well
made, though it seems Russians need to discover the benefits of hex head
or Philips head screws as most of the internal fasteners are flat head!
But can you believe it, there aren't even any vacuum tubes or magnetic
relays for logic inside! :)
<p>
If I can find a similar laser with a bad laser head but good controller,
it should be possible to do a swap as there is only 1 pot in the controller,
so setting that in the good controller to the same resistance value
as tho one in the bad controller should get close.  I don't believe there
are any microprocessors or EEPROMS in the controller.
<p>
I have also considered attaching the laser head to a lab controller. But even
determining the laser head connectors will take some effort since there
is some circuitry inside, not just wires.  But I
think I've identified the TEC and LD connections (apparently only one pair of
wires for both LDs - current sharing must be taken care of in the
laser head).  But the temperature sensor is buried and the light sensors
go through pots in the laser head so identifying their connection
will take more work.
<p>

lasers (I have what passes for the user manual) or one they'd like to sell
or trade, please contact me via the

<h2>Crystalaser DPSS Green Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.crystalaser.com/">Crystalaser</A> is a Far East
manufacturer of diode and DPSS lasers.  The latter appear to be based on
their own optically contacted or optical bonded composite crystals or
Multi-Crystal Assemblies (MCAs).  They use a C-mount 1 or 2 watt pump
diode with both fast and slow axis beam correction (lenses and an anamorphic
prism pair), followed by a focusing lens into the MCA.  A beam
expander/collimator is placed at the output.
However, neither of the two versions I've seen had an IR-blocking filter
and one of these was supposedly un-modified so that's a bit strange.
<p>
I've seen two samples of Crystalaser DPSS lasers: a GCL-25-S laserhead
and a complete GCL-150-S system.  I believe the "S" means
Single Longitudinal Mode (SLM), which would make it suitable for
holography and other similar applications.
<p>
The GCL-25-S laser head had a physically broken LD TEC and was missing the
output optics entirely.  The pump diode tested good, so repair might be
possible in the future.  The GCL-150-S system had
supposedly been bought new by a company that then sold it as "surplus
to their needs".  But it has some serious stability problems.
In particular, it refused to produce any decent power and would run
multi-spatial mode.  Careful adjustment of the MCA position could get
it to produce a TEM00, which it would retain until power was turned off.
It would also have decent, thought not perfect SLM - maybe 90 percent
with at least one small additional mode.  However, if power was turned off
for awhile and the laser was then restarted, it might behave for awhile,
but then would suddently go back to multi-spatial mode and low power.
Adjustment of the pump diode and crystal temperature could affect the
SLM purity from totally multimode to nearly pure SLM.  But this didn't seem
to have any effect on the stability issues.  I do not know what could be
wrong other than something with the MCA, but even then can't really
speculate on what it might be that wouldn't have much more permanent
effects.
<p>
Here are some photos of the GCL-150-S, but the GCL-25-S would be virtually
identical.

 It's considered a user adjustment but heck, I'd rather have a pot on
 the front panel!  The light blue pot to the far left is for crystal
 temperature.  The light blue pot near it is for LD temperature.  The gray
 pot on the right near the power transistors may be LD current limit.

 KTP is hidden inside the metal block.
</ul>
<p>
Some laser heads include an angled beam sampler plate reflecting a portion
of the beam to a photodiode for output power monitoring and/or control.
<p>
These would be very easy lasers to drive with a home-built or third party
controller like the LDC 3900 due to their straightforward design and simple
wiring.  Here is the pinout for the laser head:

   9   Black              Crystal thermistor
</PRE>
<p>
Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The green and blue wires are soldered to pin 3 but may go to either
 the LD or Crystal TEC, apparently at random.
<p>
<li>In laser heads with a beam sampler plate for output power monitoring
 or control, the violet wire first goes to a photodiode (PDC?) in
 parallel with a 100 ohm resistor, then (PDA?) to the LD thermistor.  This
 does not affect operation when in constant current mode and either
 laser head will work with the CL-2000 controller (in constant current
 mode at least).
</ol>
<p>
I've only seen three samples so am not really sure if the pinouts and/or wire
colors are the same for all.  But so far, they appear to be consistently

<h2>The Transverse Green DPSS Laser</h2>

These are among the least expensive medium power green DPSS lasers available.
However, the low cost (under $1,000) comes at a price (no pun...).  The
heart of the laser - the pump diode and vanadate - are glued together
making any repair or modifications difficult if not impossible.  More
fundamentally, there is no beam shaping of the pump diode output so the
output beam may not have a nice circular Gaussian profile even if it is
TEM00.  See: <A HREF="http://www.transverse.com/">Transverse Industries,
Ltd.</A> for links to complete specifications of their TIM622 series of
green DPSS lasers (as well as other assorted gadgetry).
<p>
Older versions have <i>no</i> temperature control other than 1 or 2 fans.
With these, power output is extremely sensitive to ambient temperature
and stability may not even be on par with a typical green laser pointer.
I have one sample that varies literally by 3:1 in output power between
68 and 78 &deg;F (20 to 25 &deg;C).  I don't know if that is typical but
I don't believe such a wide variatons is considered defective.  It's hard to
believe that one can sell something so finicky but I guess most people don't
have a laser power meter to check it.  The temperature range over which it
reaches spec'd output power is probably much less than 1 &deg;C.  Not
surprisingly, I think that Transverse has since added temperature
regulation.  On the plus side, this unit has a very nice beam profile -
possibly better than that of a $38,000 Coherent 532.
<p>
Thanks to Chay Donohoe for reverse engineering the TIM622 power supply.  Since
Transverse is one of those companies that sands off the chip numbers, he had
to sacrifice one unit to actually crack open the ICs to see the part number
on the die!  There is certainly nothing special to warrant such paranoia.
See <A HREF="tim622ps.gif">TIM622 DPSS Laser Power Supply</A>.
It's just a constant current driver with very little to write home about. :)
So what's the point of trying to keep it a secret!
<p>
In an effort to improve the stability, I am add a
circuit to control the main fan based on the temperature of the DPSS
module.  See the section: <A HREF="lasercds.htm#cdsstcf">Simple
Temperature Controlled Fan</A>.  This greatly reduces power fluctuations
after warmup.
<p>
I consider the laser described in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="lasercds.htm#cdsrd80">Reconstruction of an 80 mW Green DPSSFD
Laser</A> to be of a more sophisticated design, even if it does have all sorts
of quality and manufacturing problems.
<p>
Newer versions of this laser have (possibly as an option) the addition
of a temperature display and pots to control fan speed.  Woopie. :)

I've just bought a 50 mW DPSS laser from Transverse. It cost me $800 which was
a bit more than the original price of $600, but they'd "modified the cooling"
since the original quote I got.
<p>
Anyway, there are still 2 fans on them, one extract and one blower onto the
main heatsink. The mod consists of an LCD display showing the temperature of
the heatsink and details of the optimum temperature at which it should be run.
Each fan is connected to a potentiometer to vary its speed.  This is very
crude temp control and would need constant adjustment to attain optimum
operating temperature.  It's not really worth the extra $200 or so though
apparently the laser diode supply/regulator is improved
as it ramps up to running voltage!!
<p>
I've since added a thermistor and simple feedback circuit which keeps my
temperature regulated to the optimum 32 &deg;C.

I just took delivery of my newest laser - a 50 mW 532 nm DPSS module,
Transverse model TIM622.  They have several models available at other
power ratings.  I got it from a guy named Scott Smith, of PWS in Fresno,
CA (scott93727@aol.com).  He imports them from Transverse Technologies in
Taiwan.  These are not the highest quality lasers in the world, but they are
a very good deal at $995.  The rated specs are: 50 mW, 532 nm, less than 2 mR
divergence, 100:1 polarization, TEM00, and 2,000 hour life.  That last one is
what gets me - they should last a lot longer than 2,000 hours.  However, they
are warranted for 2,000, so they will probably go for awhile after that.  It
came with complete test data sheets, indicating that it greatly exceeds these
specification - 70 mW, 0.3 mR divergence.  The pump diode is rated 2 W and is
being run at 1.1 W, so it really should keep going for awhile.  The beam
profile is a bit sketchy - it's sort of a slightly skewed Gaussian, but hey -
it's pretty good, and it should do holography with no problem.  I don't think
you'll find 50+ mW of green light (especially not at such high apparent
intensity - 532 is really bright), guaranteed for at least 2 K hours, for
less than that price anywhere.  Most argon tubes won't do more than 5,000
hours or so, and they degrade over time, weigh a lot, and require massive
amounts of power.  This thing is likely to keep above 50 mW until the bitter
end, it uses less than 24 W of input, and it weighs about a pound.  Another
big advantage is the small size (3.5" x 4" x 5.75") and 12 VDC power.  I
love it!
<p>
Note that I'ms not affiliated with his company in any way, and I have no
long-term experience with these lasers - I'm just real happy I got something
this bright for about a thousand bucks!
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
How's the power stability over time?  How repeatable is the power at
turn-on?  (Does it come on at 70 mW sometimes, 55 mW sometimes, etc.)?
<p>
Any idea of the percent optical noise (i.e., does it have the green noise
problem?).
<p>
Lifetime limiting factor is probably the pump diode. How does he guarantee
2,000 hours, when (I assume) the thing doesn't have an hour-meter?
<p>
(From: Mike.)
<p>
I have not measured the power stability or repeatability yet, but I will in the
next couple weeks.  Visually, it looks consistent in both respects - but that
doesn't say much.  I have not measured optical noise, but I will do that, too. 
I just got the thing yesterday afternoon, so I haven't had time to do anything
but a single power reading yet.  The pump diode is rated 2 A and is being run
at 1.16 A, if the spec sheet is real (it's from the diode manufacturer, not
Transverse).  I wondered the same thing you are, though: How do you guarantee
lifetime if it has no hour meter?
<p>
(From: AESLasers (aeslasers@aol.com).)
<p>
Yeah, those died anywhere from 50 hours to a few hundred hours.  Seems to me
the person looked at it, and said the diodes were crap.  $995 isn't a good
deal for a boat anchor, and what good is a warranty if you can't collect on
it?  I don't think you want to fly to Taiwan to make sure it gets fixed.
Back to the old adage "you get what you pay for".
<p>
(From: Mike.)
<p>
Quite true - especially for one that only weighs a pound (it would be useless
as a boat anchor!).
<p>
Well, I knew I was taking a risk when I ordered it.  This is an
insurance-funded  replacement for a 25 mW, 488 nm argon laser that was damaged
in an incident involving toxic mold (long story, don't ask).  That argon had
2,500 hours on it but was still doing fine until the microbes hit.  This DPSS
unit (which is sitting beside me right now, illuminating the wall) is far more
fun.  I essentially got it for $600, since that's what I paid for the argon to
begin with.  It's real hard to believe this is a lemon, but I guess I'll find
out in a couple months.  If and when it checks out, I think I'll probably just
disassemble it for parts and educational value rather than attempt to get it
repaired by the manufacturer.  If it's the pump diode that goes out, I may be
able to replace it with a 1.2 W fiber-coupled unit I have and a GRIN lens.
It's frequency is tuned for YLF (797 nm), but I'ms sure I'd get a few tens of
mW out of it at 532 nm - assuming the original diode can be removed without
messing with the vanadate and KTP.  If all else fails, it sure is a neat
little fan-cooled case!  Oh, well.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
These units ARE the same as what people have complained about on the USENET
newsgroup <A HREF="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</A>.  These systems are rather
poorly put together, and are prone to failures and rapid degradation of
performance over time.  Other people who have used numbers of them have had
many fail well before the rated 2,000 hours.  I wouldn't buy a bunch of um till
you see how long it lasts if I were you.
<p>
(From: Joachim Mueller (JoachimMueller@swol.de).)
<p>
It is not possible to remove the vanadate-chip because it is glued to the diode
I had 2 of the units from a friend with dead diodes and
he wanted me to repair them. There is no way to that! You will definitely break
the chip or damage the coatings. Maybe you are lucky and the thing runs long
time. Because they drive the diode with only half of the power, lifetime should
be longer.
<p>
If you want to see beam characteristics, unscrew the collimator lens at the
front. Then you have a large spot and can see if it is a Gaussian shape.
You don't need to measure noise. It is clear that such a laser (and nearly
all low-price DPSS) have more or less noise and also large power
fluctuations (10 to 20%). But this is not important for a show device.
<p>
Maybe you can put an hour-meter to the thing and later let us all know, what
lifetime it reached (hopefully more than 1,000 hours).
<p>
(From: Hays Goodman (HGood501@aol.com).)

This is my first laser, so I thought I'd relate briefly my experiences with 
the Transverse DPSS laser.
<p>
I've probably operated my 60 mW model a total of around twenty hours or so, 
and so far I am extremely pleased with the performance. Warm-up time is 
heavily temperature-dependent.  I received the laser in the dead of winter, 
and it was often reluctant to fire up until as much as a twenty-minute warm 
up time, then the beam would stabilize. Now that summer is here and indoor 
ambient temperatures have probably risen by fifteen degrees or so, warmup is 
in the several minute range before the beam really settles down. Power also 
seems greater (I don't own a power meter), but it's definitely brighter at
75 &deg;F ambient as opposed to 60 &deg;F ambient. 
<p>
On a purely aesthetic level, the beam is lovely. Solid and extremely bright, 
even when reflected and somewhat diffused. With a light layer of smoke in the 
air, even large "cones" are spectacularly visible. With the beam projected 
in open space, going out a thousand feet or so produces a beam about 
closed-fist diameter; I intend to experiment with external collimation to see 
if this can be improved. The beam visibility definitely makes safety a bit 
less onerous, since beam paths are easily detected in low-light conditions. 
Best of all it's light, small, easily transported and quiet, the dual fans 
making only a slight sound like a computer tower.
<p>
I can't speak to lifetime yet, but to this point it's been a dream.
