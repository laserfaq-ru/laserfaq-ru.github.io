<h2>Basic Home-Built HeNe Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="chnchn0">Introduction to Home-Built HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The HeNe laser was the first one presented in the Scientific American Amateur
Scientist columns only a couple of years after the invention of the laser and
less than this after the invention of the HeNe laser!  At least this one is
designed to operate at the common visible 632.8 nm (orange-red) wavelength
like that of common HeNe lasers found in high school physics labs and barcode
scanners.  (The original HeNe laser's output was in the IR portion of the E/M
spectrum and quite invisible.)  It is a very basic design as gas lasers go but
due to the need for extremely low amounts of contaminants in the gas fill does
require a decent vacuum system and some use of nasty chemicals (at least as
described) including fuming nitric acid for cleaning the glass laser tube
before evacuation and dry ice/acetone slurry for the cold trap!
<p>
Although one of the simplest in basic structure, given these requirements,
the HeNe laser may not be the best home-built laser for the novice.  In fact,
it is deceptively simple and yet one of the most difficult gas lasers to
construct from scratch.  However,
later in this chapter, we present a number of alternatives to the HeNe laser
fully built from the ground up using beach sand and copper ore.  Therefore,
it is still possible to experiment with partially home-built HeNe lasers
(beyond just wiring together a HeNe tube and power supply) using various
proportions of your own ingredients without doing everything from scratch. :)

<h3><A NAME="chnsaf">Home-Built HeNe Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are two areas of safety considerations for the home-built HeNe laser (and
other similar lasers, for that matter):
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built HeNe laser may be capable of producing
 a beam of up to 1 mW or more at several wavelengths.  While 1 mW doesn't
 sound like much compared to, say, a CO2 laser, since there doesn't seem to be
 any hard information on the actual power obtainable with this or similar HeNe
 laser designs, it is important to take precautions assuming a higher power
 until determined otherwise.  In addition, while the red (632.8 nm) wavelength
 is the one you are likely aiming for, HeNe lasers like to operate at several
 IR wavelengths including 1,152.3 nm, 1,523.1 nm, and 3,391.3 nm which are
 totally invisible but the first at least, is NOT eye-safe.  Depending on the
 type of mirrors you use, accidental generation of the IR wavelengths, while
 not likely, may still be possible.
<p>
 Take precautions to avoid eye contact with the direct or reflected beam,
 whether or not it is visible.  This includes the 4 pairs of beams reflecting
 off the Brewster windows which may be quite strong.
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supplies can be lethal.  Neon sign transformer
 based power supplies have enough voltage and current to stop a heart,  Even
 if you aren't killed, the shock may startle you into doing something you might
 regret.  Make sure you read and follow the <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety
 Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment</A>.  Insulate all
 connections and install barriers to prevent contact with the high voltage.
</ul>
<p>
Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlc1">HeNe Laser Safety</A>
for more info.  However, the home-built HeNe laser uses a different sort of
power supply than CW commercial types (unless you are attempting something
similar to one of these) so some of the specific details may not apply,)
<p>
For more information, see the chapter: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser
Safety</A> and the more specific information in the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlc1">HeNe Laser Safety</A>.  Sample safety
labels which can be edited for this laser can be found in the section:
<A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saflslbl">Laser Safety Labels and Signs</A>.

Finally, I have an excellent description with photos of a successful home-built
HeNe laser constructed by John S. Rubacha while at Purdue University Calumet.
This short paper covers the technical aspects as well as trials and
tribulations of undertaking this project:

<p>
<ul>
<li>The only  other actual example of a successful home-built HeNe laser
 (beyond those described in the Scientific American articles) that I am
 personally aware of, was constructed by Mark Wilson:
<p>
 (From: Mark Wilson (wilson_mark@htc.honeywell.com).) 
<p>
 <blockquote>
 "When I saw the Scientific American article on building your own HeNe laser, I
  decided that I wanted to build it. The Scientific American HeNe laser was
  extremely difficult to build and I could not have done it without a lot of
  help. I got Spectra-Physics to donate a set of laser mirrors to me, a glass
  shop in my home town to help me cut and grind the Brewster window angles on
  the tube. The tube was made from lead glass from a sign company, and I also
  used neon sign electrodes. The optical rail was a 3 foot long piece of 2"x6"
  extruded aluminum that I got from a glass company which used this material to
  make doors for commercial buildings.
<p>
  I followed the directions in the Scientific American article to the letter.
  I sealed the microscope slides to the glass tube using flexible colodian
  that I got from a pharmacy. I filled the tube at a sign company which had
  He, Ne, Ar and other gases on a glass manifold. I assembled the laser and
  made the power supply using a mercury rectifier tube and a neon sign
  transformer. I got the tube to lase for a brief time, but since it was not a
  hard-sealed tube it quickly died probably due to helium diffusion. The tube
  would light up but not lase for a while then that too stopped."
 </blockquote>
<p>
<li>There were a few commercial HeNe lasers in the late 1960s and early 1970s
 that were constructed along the lines of the typical home-built HeNe laser.
 See <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 2.08

<p>
<li>See the chapter: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A>
 as some companies will sell laser mirrors and external cavity HeNe tubes
 (should you decide to only go half way!) but expect them to be pricey!
 I have several one-Brewster HeNe laser tubes for sale.  These have an
 internal HR mirror with a Brewster window at the other end.  I also have
 some two-Brewster HeNe laser tubes for sale.  See the

<h3><A NAME="chnchn2">Home-Built HeNe Laser Description</A></h3>

Although the helium-neon laser is one of the simpler gas lasers in existence,
it is probably in the middle of the range of difficulty of home-built lasers
discussed in this document and "Light and its Uses".
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="hene1asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Helium-Neon Laser Assembly</A> for
a simplified diagram of the overall glasswork and power supply electronics.
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall - M to H.
  <li>Glass work - M.
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work) - M.
  <li>Vacuum/gas handling - H.
  <li>Power supply - L.
  <li>Additional apparatus (optical mirror alignment jig) - M.
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - 632.8 nm (red).  There is also another line at
  640.1 nm (red) which has a fair amount of gain and may work with the same
  mirrors.  Operation at other visible HeNe laser wavelengths including
  611.9 nm (orange), 594.1 nm (yellow), and 543.5 nm (green), may be possible
  but the gain at these wavelengths is much lower so almost *any* losses will
  kill oscillation (especially green - a functioning green home-built HeNe
  laser would be quite an achievement).  IR output at 1,152.3 nm, 1,523.1 nm,
  or 3,391.3 nm should also be possible.  The last in particular has the
  highest gain of any HeNe transition and in fact will lase without mirrors
  (superradiantly) in a moderately long tube.  However, electronic detection
  of this wavelength isn't possible using common photodiodes and it's kind
  of boring unless you're doing research in mid-IR phenomena.
<p>
  Operation at wavelengths more than a few nm away from 632.8 nm (except
  possibly for 640.1 nm) would likely require changing the mirrors to have
  their reflectivity peak at that wavelength (unless they are very high
  reflectivity broadband coated), and using the appropriate angle for the
  Brewster windows (or implementing an adjustable Brewster angle as described
  in conjunction with the <A HREF="lasercar.htm#cartoc">Home-Built Pulsed
  Argon and/or Krypton (Ar/Kr) Ion Laser Laser</A>).
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium - Low pressure mixture of He and Ne gas.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter - 2 mm; bore length - 34 cm.
<p>
  <li>Total tube length (to center of the Brewster windows) - 45 cm.
<p>
  <li>Tube material - Glass, type not stated.
<p>
  <li>Electrodes - Cold cathode type using neon sign electrodes or small
    aluminum cylinders.  These are mounted in side-arms or in side-side-arms.
    The use a of larger side-side arm with a large can style aluminum cathode
    might permit the laser to be run on a normal HeNe laser power supply.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill - 7:1 ratio of He:Ne at about 2.5 Torr.
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air.  Increased cooling is of little value.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Corning 7940 glass.  The authors also mention the use of
    quartz to minimize heat losses and the Brewster angle they specify of 32.8
    degrees from the axis is consistent with quartz (crystalline, not fused).
    I don't know whether these materials are the same.  However, see below
    for a possible reason to use borosilicate glass instead of quartz.
<p>
  <li>Mirrors  - Dielectric, concave, RoC = 60 cm.  Three-screw
    <A HREF="mmount1.gif">Adjustable Mirror Mount</A> at each end.
    Reflection coefficient not stated for either mirror.
    Alignment using flash light bulb and beamsplitter apparatus (described in
    article).
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length (mirror face to mirror face) - 57.5 cm.
  </ul>
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Requirements - medium.  Article calls for 10<sup>-5</sup> Torr which
    would be nice but perhaps not essential.
<p>
  <li>Sealed tube operation but limited life (perhaps 50 hours) before
    regassing is required.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required - Fuming nitric acid to clean laser
    tube glass parts before evacuation/baking/backfill.
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - Electrical discharge.
<p>
  <li>Power supply - 9,000 VRMS, 18 mA neon sign transformer and Variac.  The
    maximum optical output power was at 85 percent of full voltage.

<h3><A NAME="chnguide">Guidelines to Assure a Successful Home-Built HeNe
 Laser</A></h3>

These set of guidelines should be followed during construction of your first
home-built HeNe laser.  The factors below will greatly influence the ultimate
output power, beam quality, and whether it produces any coherent light at all!
Once you have a working laser, feel free to make modifications - one at a time.
Thanks to George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com) for his comments.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use the proper diameter thick wall capillary and assure that it is
 straight.  A smaller diameter than used in the SciAm HeNe laser may be
 beneficial, say between 1 and 1.5 mm.  This will both increase the gain
 (which is inversely proportional to bore diameter) as well as help to assure
 a TEM00 beam profile.  A larger bore will tend to operate with multiple
 longitudinal modes (which you may find interesting as well).  Slight warp or
 sag of the capillary can be adjusted with intermediate bore supports.  Avoid
 the temptation to just use a narrow thin wall tube which would make the entire
 assembly very fragile.
<p>
 However, there are two disadvantages to using a narrow bore:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>It will result in a higher operating and starting voltage which should
  be taken into account in your power supply design.  (Or, cheat and use a
  commercial HeNe power supply compatible with a tube of similar length while
  testing your laser.)
<p>
 <li>Alignment using the card method will be more difficult.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>The small capillary in the larger tube approach as presented in the SciAm
 article may be a bad idea for two reasons:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Any gap between the inner and outer tubes will result in structural
  instability.
<p>
 <li>The discharge may bypass the inner capillary entirely (particularly with
  a narrower bore) which would be bad news indeed.
 </ol>
<p>
 I would recommend a one piece approach instead, with
 a thick-walled capillary fused directly to glass extensions (as used in the
 Vander Sluis et. al. paper) if your glass working skills and/or budget
 are up to it (or glued to metal extensions if using the no glass working
 approach).
<p>
<li>Obtain good quality glass optical flats for the Brewster windows.  They
 should be at least 1 mm thick to minimize distortion from the vacuum (not
 microscope cover slips!).  These don't have to be expensive - plenty of low
 cost surplus optics is available.  While some microscope slides <i>might</i>
 work, there is no real way to be sure before your entire laser is assembled
 and then it is too late to change.  Any candidate Brewster window should pass
 the following tests:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>When viewed edgewise, it must <b>NOT</b> have a greenish (or other
  color) tint.
 <p>
 <li>When you hold it at arm's length and view something across the room
  through it, there should be no detectable magnification or minification.
 <p>
 <li>When viewed against a black background in a concentrated light beam (such
  as sunlight passing through an f/4 concentrating lens) it should show very
  little scattering of light (from incomplete cleaning or incomplete
  polishing).
 </ol>
<p>
 No other aspect of the laser tube assembly itself is as important as the
 quality of the Brewster windows to the ultimate outcome of this project!
 While, certain types of distortion won't prevent lasing (some may even make
 it more exciting with complex mode structures), this is a complicating
 factor your first laser can do without.
<p>
 The author of the SciAm article suggests the use of quartz instead of glass
 to minimize heat losses but that material has a high transmittance at the
 3.391 um IR wavelength which interferes with operation at 632.8 nm (and other
 visible wavelengths).  If you insist on quartz (perhaps to have the option of
 3.391 um operation in the future), also obtain a pair of glass flats to add
 outside the tube to kill that line.  If you do try lasing at 3.391 um,
 aluminum mirrors should be fine.  This line will even lase with no mirrors
 (superradiantly) in a long enough tube.
<p>
<li>Cut the ends of the laser tube to accept the Brewster windows only
 <i>>after</i> all glass working (including annealing) has been performed as
 these steps may affect the angles enough to increase losses.  Take care that
 the angle is close to the correct value for your window material (33.3 to
 34.2 degrees from the beam axis for most window materials) with their
 perpendiculars as close to parallel as possible.  (An error of up to 1/2
 degree is acceptable in both cases.  The ball-and-socket approach of the
 SciAm pulsed Ar/Kr ion laser can be used instead to provide some adjustment
 range but this really isn't needed.)  Use the /===\ arrangement, <b>not</b>
 /===/ (which will shift the optical axis).   Make sure the inside surfaces
 of the windows are immaculately clean before installation!  They can't really
 be cleaned properly once attached to the tube.
<p>
<li>Mount the electrodes in side-arms well away from and with no line-of-sight
 to the Brewster windows.  This will minimize the deposit of a metallic film
 on the Brewster windows due to sputtering (particularly at the negative
 electrode).
<p>
<li>Don't skip the essential cleaning step before final assembly of the
 Brewster windows to the laser tube.  This will greatly reduce the amount of
 bake-out required once you are under vacuum.  It will still be necessary to
 pass a high current through the tube in both directions for some time as
 well as running a low temperature torch over areas that aren't heated enough
 by the discharge.  However, the amount of outgassing and required time will
 be greatly reduced.
<p>
 CAUTION: Apparently, it is possible for an electron beam to be produced from
 the positive electrode during the high current bake-out step which can quickly
 melt a hole through the tube wall opposite the side-arm if left running for
 more than a few seconds.  The visual effect will first be a spot of bright
 yellow sodium light from the point of impact.  Use lower current and/or make
 that area of the tube (the outside of the turn) much thicker.
<p>
<li>Obtain proper laser resonator mirrors.  Sorry, you can't make these in
 your basement.  Don't even bother to try silvered or aluminized mirrors
 (e.g., from barcode scanners), at least not until you have the laser working
 with real mirrors.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The HR should have as high a reflectivity as possible and the OC should
  have about 99 percent reflectivity (assuming the 34 cm or so active bore
  length), both at 632.8 nm.  If your laser is longer, the OC reflectivity
  can be reduced slightly but starting with 99 percent will work well, if not
  being quite optimal.  Or, if you would like to have beams from both ends
  or identical mirrors are much cheaper, they can both be 99.5 percent.  For
  initial testing, the use of a pair of HR mirrors will result in the lowest
  threshold and the highest likelihood of lasing if something else is
  marginal.  Once you see the (coherent) light, a proper OC can be installed.
<p>
 <li>Their Radius of Curvature (RoC) should be between L and 2*L, where L is
  the distance between mirrors.  An RoC of L will result in a confocal cavity
  which has a number of attributes including being relatively easy to align.
  An alternative which may be desirable is to implement a folded confocal
  cavity with an RoC of 2*L for the HR and infinity (planar) for the OC.
  See the sections: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioimir">Mirrors used for Lasers
  and Laser Applications</A> and <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao3">Mirrors for
  Home-Built Lasers</A> for more info.
<p>
 <li>Mirrors salvaged from commercial HeNe laser tubes will be satisfactory if
  their RoC and reflectivities are as described above.  Those from short tubes
  will have RoCs that are too small and won't do anything useful.  The OC from
  a long tube may have a reflectivity that is too low.  Mirrors from a
  large-frame HeNe laser would probably be suitable though their RoCs will be
  long making alignment more critical.
 </ul>
<p>
<p>
<li>Mount everything on a stable base and make sure your mirror mounts have
 adequate precision!  No amount of fiddling will compensate for mirrors that
 change position on their own.  Yes, it may be possible to assemble a working
 laser mounted on wobbly stands but this isn't recommended!
<p>
<li>Unless you want to be faithful to the era when the first HeNe laser was
 built (and there were no other lasers handy), I'd recommend using another
 HeNe or collimated diode laser to perform the mirror alignment.  Mount the
 alignment laser to the baseplate so that it will be there whenever you need
 it.  Do the initial alignment once everything is assembled but <i>before</i> 
 actually evacuating the system and filling it with the HeNe gas mixture.
 Then, you'll be ready to lase, or at least very close.  The card method of
 alignment can also be used but may be a bit tougher with the recommended
 narrower bore.
<p>
<li>Use spectroscopic grade premixed HeNe gas with a 7:1 to 10:1 ratio (partial
 pressure/molar).  Party balloon helium <b>won't</b> work due to gross amounts
 of contamination.  The purity of the gas fill is extremely critical as the
 HeNe laser's performance drops off like a rock with even small amounts of
 N2, O2, H2, and other non-He and non-Ne constituents.  As little as .01 Torr
 of H2 in your 1 or 2 Torr tube will kill lasing entirely.
<p>
<li>If you are determined to seal off the tube after the laser is functional,
 run it for several hours while still connected to the vacuum system
 and continue to monitor and adjust the pressure during this time.  The
 electrodes will act as getters of sorts and will remove unwanted non-inert
 gases as well as some of the helium and neon, necessitating refilling.  Then,
 perform the seal-off without powering down - this will insure that conditions
 are correct at the normal operating temperature.  Don't forget the very
 critical act of offering the proper chants and incantations to the "gods of
 newly born lasers" - though I don't know how much this really helps! :)
<p>
<li>Make sure you read, understand, and follow <b>ALL</b> the safety
 guidelines found in the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsaf">Home-Built

<h2>Other Examples of Home-Built HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="chnslui">K. L. Vander Sluis et. al. HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The following isn't quite a home-built laser but would be the equivalent
in the arly 1960s - one of the first visible HeNe lasers on the planet:
<p>
(From: George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com).)
<p>
<blockquote>
 "I have read with interest your wealth of information on home-built
  HeNe laser because every problem you dealt with was one that we grappled
  with about forty years ago.  I was a member of a group here in Oak Ridge
  that built the first HeNe laser in Tennessee about six months after Bell
  Labs announced the construction of theirs.
<p>
  Back in the 1960's we had a laser development group that decided that
  before we came out with a new kind of laser we should get laser
  experience by building one (HeNe) like Bell Labs.  Ken Van der Sluis
  was the principal investigator.  His prior experience with resonators
  was with the Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer, so much of our construction
  was adapted from FP construction.  The reflectors were 5 cm diameter
  in mountings that used 1/4 - 80 threads on the adjusting screws and
  Invar rods to maintain spacing, a case of overkill on every turn.
<p>
  The finest window material we had were quartz FP flats 5 cm diameter x 1 cm
  thick, and these were cemented onto the Brewster-cut tube ends.  Ken
  was measuring gain with a spectrometer, adjusting mirror angles, gas
  mix, gas pressure, and discharge current, trying to find the magic
  combination but with no luck.  Then Ken realized that it was possible that
  the infrared transition at 3.391 um was depopulating the upper level of the
  transition we wanted to use.  After adding a borosilicate crown glass (BSC)
  flat (which blocks 3.391 um) to one of the windows with masking tape, and
  some realignment of the mirrors, it wasn't long before he got the first
  spark of red light - the first HeNe laser light in Tennessee!  Soon word
  got around and for the next day or two we had dozens of visitors to see
  this fascinating red sparkling light. (It was our opinion that Bell Labs
  did not know about the 3.39 um trap and that they were lucky to have tried
  BSC first.)
<p>
  The lasers we made were made to get that sparkly red light and we were not
  concerned about the mode structure (except for our theoretical physicist who
  was fascinated by all the different multi-mode patterns we could get with
  our wide bore tube and he had names for them all).  In fact, we soon
  abandoned using thick Brewster windows with optically flat surfaces, and
  sometimes used ordinary microscope slides.
<p>
  This work led to our development of a demonstration laser which we
  took to universities and a few high schools mostly over the eastern
  United States, and also to South America and Hungary.
<p>
  Everything can be found in the paper: "A Simplified Construction of a
  Helium-Neon Visible Laser", by K. L. Vander Sluis, G. K. Werner, P. M.
  Griffin, H. W. Morgan, O. B. Rudolph, and P. A. Staats in the American
  Journal of Physics, vol. 33(3), pp. 225-240, March 1965.
<p>
  (Here is another paper from the same group at Oak Ridge National Lab that
  should probably be in another chapter but I put it here: "Conversion of a
  Simplified HeNe Gas Laser to Pulsed Operation with Ar, Kr, and Xe", H. W.
  Morgan, P. A. Staats, P. M. Griffin, G. K. Werner, and K. L. Vander Sluis,
  American Journal of Physics, vol. 37(9), pp. 938-939, September 1969.

<p>
  My most important contribution to the effort was that I was the inventor
  of the Laser Alignment Card, which you allude to later in this chapter.  I
  could go on for several pages talking about lasers.  We old-timers love to
  talk and reminisce!"
</blockquote>
<p>
(George has since gone on for several pages talking about lasers and has
contributed several sections relating to the home-built HeNe laser,
amateur laser construction in general, and other laser topics.)
<p>
The HeNe laser presented in the paper is very similar to the SciAm design
which isn't terribly surprising given that it was published in the same time
frame.  A photo in the paper shows the minimalist approach to laser design -
the laser tube as well as the resonator mirrors supported by chemist's burette
clamps on wobbly ring-stands with a Tesla-type leak tester for excitation!
Well, maybe.  Some of may partially home-built laser test rigs were a lot
less stable. :)  OK, this isn't what they recommend building (or what is
described more fully in the paper and below) but it was included to drive
home the point that you don't need a lot of sophistication to construct a
working laser.
<p>
I really liked the suggested supplier list (with 1965 prices!) which was
thoughtfully included with my copy of the reprint of the paper.  Optical
windows for 25 cents; 1 liter flasks of He:Ne gas mixture for $6.50, and
(small) neon sign transformers for $9.95.  If only these companies were still 
n business today (using those same prices)!  What I would give for a working
time machine. :)  One interesting thing is that while some items were quite
inexpensive (if inflation wasn't taken into account), the dielectric mirrors
were priced quite high - after all, this was new technology!  And similarly,
semiconductor rectifiers, which are dirt cheap today, were 10 or 20 times as
expensive in 1965 dollars - much much more if inflation is included.
<p>
There is one piece of information that can be inferred from the paper
that is lacking from all of the SciAm articles: The actual optical
power output.  Based on their use of a silicon photodiode detector, I expect
that it peaked in the .5 to 1.25 mW range depending on gas fill ratio and
pressure.  This assumes a photodiode current sensitivity of .4 to .5 mA/mW.
Note that this was with mirrors that were about half as efficient as modern
ones (they had significant absorption losses) and they were both OCs so an
equal mount of power exited both ends.  Thus, it would appear that up to
about 5 mW may have been possible by using a modern HR/OC pair.  Maybe I
could use that time machine to take them a set. :)
<p>
Here is a description of the HeNe laser presented in the paper summarized
in my standard format.  Some of the dimensions below were estimated as there
is no dimensioned drawing in the paper.  The authors suggest a variety of
possible modifications as well.  While the title of the paper implies a
simplified approach, the authors did have access to a decent machine shop
(including lathe and diamond cutoff wheel) and glass working shop (the glass
fabrication looked perfect).  However, like the SciAm lasers, this really
isn't essential.

<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air.
<p>

    of 10<sup>-6</sup> Torr.
<p>

As noted, T2 is actually three, 3 KV, 18 mA, neon sign transformers wired in
parallel to obtain the 54 mA current rating.  Rb, the ballast resistor,
consists of 4, 25 K, 20 W resistors in series with taps to adjust the tube
current.
<p>
Note that the voltage ratings of C1 to C3 are marginal at best.  Should the
spark gap fail, the output voltage could easily climb to nearly 10 KV.

<h2>Additional Information on Home-Built HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="chnchn3">Estimate of Home-Built HeNe Laser Output Power</A></h3>

Given our knowledge of the construction of a modern HeNe laser tube and the
type of power supply used, it isn't surprising that the available output power
from this 35+ year old design will be less than optimal - probably a lot less!
<p>
A modern tube with a 34 cm discharge length would be rated about 5 mW when run
from a normal HeNe laser power supply (DC, constant current).

<ul>
<li>The actual bore of the HeNe laser from "Light and its Uses" is 34 cm in
  length with an ID of 2 mm.  For its ID, this is rather short for a modern
  HeNe tube even if it is a multi-mode (non-TEM00) type.  This is certainly
  going to affect efficiency but I have no way of really estimating by how
  much.
<p>
  For an HeNe tube, a wider bore doesn't necessarily permit higher power
  since the walls of the capillary apparently are important in depopulating
  higher energy levels.  Gain actually decreases (inversely) with increasing
  bore diameter.  I will assume that this is really equivalent to a 1 mm bore
  in a modern tube (and this may be optimistic).
<p>
  Loss factor: .5.
<p>
<li>The power supply for the home-built HeNe laser is AC from a 9,000 V, 18 mA
  (current limited) neon sign transformer run at about 85 percent input so it
  would probably be outputting about 7.65 kVRMS (10.8 kV peak, no load).  On
  each cycle, the discharge will occur once the voltage across the tube
  exceeds a several kV, possibly 5 kV or more.  Thus, a large percentage of
  each cycle is wasted.
<p>
  Loss factor: .5.
<p>
<li>Once the tube starts conducting, the current will be limited to 18 mA but
  may not actually be anywhere near constant.  The characteristics of the
  typical neon sign or oil burner ignition transformer is NOT a particularly
  good constant current source (though better than would be expected from
  a 'normal' transformer.  The actual current in the tube will be varying
  quite a bit during the period when it is conducting.  There is no way to
  know (without testing) over what portion of this variation the current is
  optimal or if the laser is even outputting at all!  HeNe lasers only produce
  an output beam over about a range of current of 2:1 or 3:1 and the portion
  of this range where output is optimal (with minimal detectable change in
  intensity) may be much smaller.  In fact, an output may be occurring mostly
  on some short portion of the rising and falling edges of the AC waveform!
<p>
  Loss factor: .5.
<p>
<li>Losses due to the Brewster windows, impure gas fill, quality (or lack
  thereof) of the mirrors, and so forth, will reduce output still further.
<p>
  Loss factor: .5.
</ul>
Funny how all the 'loss factors' are the same, huh?  Can you spell: WILD
GUESSES?
<p>
Based on these considerations, I would be surprised if the original design
produced more than .5 mW.  But the good news is that it might be possible to
approach 2 or 3 mW without too much effort using a narrower bore, large can
style cathode, and modern HeNe laser power supply.
<p>
The very similar design described in the Verder Sluis et. al. paper (see the
section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnslui">K. L. Vander Sluis et. al. HeNe
Laser</A>), had a maximum power on the order of 1 mW under optimal conditions
based on their measurement of power using a silicon photodiode.  So the wild
guesses aren't all that far off. :)  (However, it may have been capable of
as much as 4 or 5 mW using a modern HR/OC pair.)

<h3><A NAME="chnwnqw">Why Not to use Quartz Windows for a Visible HeNe
 Laser</A></h3>

(From: George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com).)
<p>
The SciAm article recommends using quartz windows because they
have the lowest losses.  We thought the same thing back in 1963 when we
were trying to build a laser like the one that had been demonstrated by the
Bell Labs people a few months earlier.  Ken Vander Sluis had built our
laser with two of our best quartz Fabry-Perot interferometer plates and
was trying for days to make it run, with no luck. 
<p>
Ken is a spectroscopist and understands how energy levels work, so he
thought about it, and reasoned that the 3.391 um transition might be
depopulating the upper level so that the visible transition wouldn't lase.
For the 3.391 um wavelength, quartz transmits well, but borosilicate and
other glasses do not. He got another pair of interferometer plates, made
of borosilicate crown glass, and put them over the quartz plates, fastening
them in place with masking tape.  After realignment he found an increase
in gain and before long he got that first sparkle of light, the first HeNe
laser in Tennessee!
<p>
So the moral of the story is: Don't count on quartz windows giving you the
best performance.  "But", you may ask, "What about those lasers with no
Brewster windows?"  I have never measured their reflectance, but my guess
is that the mirrors must have a multilayer surface that was designed with
two criteria: high reflectance at 632.8 nm and low reflectance at 3.391 um.
<p>
Even with glass Brewsters, the 3.391 um effect rears its ugly head in long
lasers, those with length of one meter or more.  In these the path length
in the plasma before encountering a window is long enough that the 3.391 um
density has a chance to build up to undesirable levels before meeting a
window.  It's called "superradiance" and can be suppressed with magnets
(preferential Zeeman splitting of the IR lines) and/or by grinding the
inner surface of the tube to scatter low-angle reflected light.  But, tubing
with a roughened interior is not as strong as standard tubing.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, that is exactly how they are designed.  With sufficiently high
transmittance at 3.391 um and possibly the frosted bore as well, the need
for magnets to split the energy levels via the Zeeman effect has also been
reduced or eliminated.  For example, even the Melles Griot 35 mW HeNe laser
(their largest model) does not need magnets even though the tube is almost a
meter long.

<h3><A NAME="chnchn4">Comments on Alignment Procedure in "Light and its
 Uses"</A></h3>

The second of the two articles on the HeNe laser: "More on the Helium-Neon
Laser" provides an alternative procedure for mirror alignment which may be
potentially hazardous (though realistically, the risk is probably minimal).
<p>
The alignment is performed with the laser powered but presumably not lasing
since a 'spoiler glass' - a glass microscope slide - is placed in the optical
path.  While this probably is fairly reliable with minimal risk for the low
gain HeNe laser described in the article, many other lasers - or even a longer
HeNe laser - may have high enough gain that the losses introduced by the
spoiler would NOT prevent lasing and a beam could appear without warning
(once the mirrors are aligned well enough) as the adjustment screws are being
tweaked!  I would NOT recommend the procedure as described for any laser
unless a more reliable method were used of preventing accidental lasing (like
the use of a 50 percent neutral density filter) or you were absolutely sure of
the maximum possible output power of your laser to be less than a couple of
mW.  Note that even with a spoiler, there is still a slight chance that a HeNe
laser will lase if the glass is nearly perpendicular to the optical axis (due
to constructive interference of the reflections from its surfaces).  A neutral
density filter would totally eliminate even this small possibility.
<p>
The description as presented is also somewhat ambiguous (but this is clarified
below).
<p>
Note that if you don't have 20/20 (corrected) or better vision, this procedure
may not be appropriate in any case since for the fine alignment, it's necessary
to view the reflection from the mirror at the far end of the laser through
its narrow bore - not easy with less than perfect eyes.
<p>
I would recommend using one of the other alignment techniques described in
"Light and its Uses" or in the chapters of this document on HeNe and Ar/Kr
lasers.
<p>
Having said all that, I am honored to have George Werner, the inventor of the
this alignment technique while at Oak Ridge around 1963, address the safety
issues and provide a clearer description of the procedure:
<p>
(From: George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com).) 
<p>
(The alignment card technique may have been independently invented elsewhere.)
<p>
First, the matter of safety.  If you are looking through the alignment
card at the time the laser starts to oscillate you will see a very bright
light, but it won't be the last light you ever see.  Have you ever looked
at a camera flash bulb when it went off?  Have you ever looked at the sun?
These sources are too bright for normal viewing so nature gives us a
defense for it - - we close our eyes immediately.  As for the laser's
brightness, the first burst of light, if adjustments are made slowly, is
much less than the maximum output. Even this exposure can be avoided, as I
will discuss later.
<p>
The alignment card I have used most recently has a hole about 2.5 mm in
diameter.  If you're worried about exposure you can make it smaller but
that makes precise seeing more difficult.  (In our report by Vander Sluis et
al, we used .5 mm)  The card stock is preferably heavier than normal
filing cards, but they will do.  The hole is made by drilling to ensure a
round shape, but this leaves paper fibers protruding into the hole, which
can be made to lay down by polishing the inner edge of the hole with wax or
maybe glue.  On the front side carefully rule a horizontal and a vertical
black line across the hole.  It is important that the intersection of these
lines be on the hole, and sometimes I think that is easier to rule the
lines first and make the hole afterward.  A piece of a red gelatin filter,
Wratten #29, is mounted on the back side of the hole.  I have stuck it in
place with a 1/2 inch circle of black masking tape with a 1/8 inch hole in
it.  Having an area of black around the hole as viewed from the back makes
it easier to find and look through.  In the deluxe model of card I use a
fluorescent red surface on the front instead of white.
<p>
The card is used in this way:  Position the card at one end of the laser,
viewing through the near reflector, so that you can sight through the card
hole and through the capillary to the far end.  (To facilitate this it may
help to place a strongly illuminated target beyond the end of the laser.
The fine print on the back of a credit card is good for this purpose.)
Holding the alignment card in this position, observe the crosslines as
reflected from the back side of the reflector and adjust the reflector so
that the pinhole image lies on the capillary axis.  Now the adjustment at
the near end is complete (we hope).
<p>
Next, take the card to the other end and repeat the operation.  Note that
at no time up to now has the laser been turned on so your eyes should be
perfectly safe.  NOW turn the laser on and it will shine with all its
brilliance (it says here). :)
<p>
If, however, the laser doesn't lase, make another inspection of the
adjustments.  This is where the red filter is needed.  If you try to sight
down the capillary while the laser is turned on, all you see is a cloud of
blue light if you don't have a red filter.  One experimenter reported the
red filter was ineffective.  I suspect that he wasn't using a Wratten #29.
The red cellophane from a box of Valentine candy won't work.  It passes too
much yellow. With a proper filter you can easily see to the far end of the
tube through the luminous plasma.   With the laser turned on, look through
the card and plan your next adjustment of the mirror but don't make it.
Then move your eye away from the pinhole and make the adjustment you
planned.  If it doesn't lase, you can look through the pinhole and repeat the
motion to see what is happening at the far end of the tube.  If your system
is geometrically correct but still not lasing, you will see a brighter (but
not brilliant) disc of light coming into position at the far end as the
final adjustment is made.  This is what is commonly called the "full moon"
effect.  If that bright spot is well centered when viewed from either end,
then you can be assured that no further mirror tweaking is called for and
you can turn your attention to gas pressure, current level and all those
other problems.
<p>
I mentioned the use of a red fluorescent alignment card.  What is the
advantage of that?  The only useful light reflected from a white card with
red filter is the red component of the illuminating light.  A  fluorescent
red card reflects the same red light but it also converts the blue, green
and yellow light to red, giving us a brighter image.
<p>
I haven't found a laser where it was not possible to see the far end of the
tube looking through the card.  Maybe the sighting hole was too small (like
1 mm or less) or maybe there was fuzz in the hole, or maybe as I have said
before the filter wasn't red enough.
<p>
In a very long narrow tube it is sometimes hard to determine straightness
because internal reflections of a curved tube can give false images of the
end opening.  The curvature of the tube focuses the light in one plane,
while at the same time in the other plane the strong focusing power of the
bore radius is decreased at grazing angles, so that there is a curvature
for which the reflected image has no astigmatism.  Once I made a little
light box to use as a target for this test.  In front of a 15w light bulb I
placed a wire screen mounted on a motor shaft to turn 6 rpm.   I set it so
that the target was moving left to right.  Then if I looked at it through
the capillary and saw an image moving right to left I knew that I was
looking at a reflection.

<h3><A NAME="chnvchn">Visually Checking the He:Ne Ratio to Test for Gas Fill
 Problems</A></h3>

(From: George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com).)
<p>
When you have confirmed good alignment and the windows are clean, you may
wonder if the gas mixture is right.  In lasers that have been sealed a long
time there is sometimes a noticeable loss of helium by diffusion through
the glass and through the Epoxy of soft-seals.  A good way to check the
He:Ne ratio is to view the discharge spectroscopicly.  I used to use a
transmission grating (600 lines/mm) for this.  In the yellow region you
will find two lines close together.  These are neon, 585.25 nm, and helium,
587.56 nm.  If the mix is right these two lines should appear approximately
equal in brightness.
<p>
For a sealed tube, the helium lost by diffusion can be restored by putting
the laser in an atmosphere of 100% helium (at 1 atm) for a day or two.  24
hours of inward diffusion this way is about equal to the outward diffusion
of a year.  (See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr1">Rejuvenating
HeNe Tubes</A>.)

<h3><A NAME="chngrn">So You Want to Build a Green HeNe Laser?</A></h3>

Recall that green (543.5 nm) is one of the lowest gain of all the common HeNe
lasers.  So, getting any sort of green laser to work will be quite a challenge.
<p>
I do have a working green HeNe laser using a special one-Brewster HeNe tube
with an HR optimized for green and a matching HR mirror.  OK, so the output
isn't anything to write home about - maybe a &micro;W - but the circulating
green photon flux is fairly impressive.  However, this setup is
just about perfect in every way with an optically contacted fused silica
Brewster window and super high reflectivity mirrors for both HRs.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chngrnob">A Green One-Brewster HeNe Laser</A>

tube will lase green at all!

The green HeNe lasing line was first observed by D. L. Perry.
See: "CW laser oscillation at 5433  in neon", D. L. Perry,
IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 7, no. 2, Feb 1971, pp. 102.
<p>
Summary: CW laser oscillation at 5433  has been observed in the He-Ne
laser. The transition is from the 3S_{2} to 2p_{10} level and is the 9th
in this group of nine allowed transitions to exhibit laser oscillation....
<p>
<blockquote>
 "Green #1 used a 65 cm long, 4 mm ID tube with a 7:1 fill ratio of He:Ne.
 Both optics had a 1% transmission at 594.1 (yellow) to kill that line.
 The current range was 16 to 40 mA (!!).
<p>
 The 611.8 nm (orange) line was used to align the laser (using red/orange
 optics).  Then the green HR mirror was installed in the beam to align it and
 then the red/orange optics were removed."

He obtained a power of 50 &micro;Watts with this setup.

<h3><A NAME="chnnog">A Home-Built HeNe Laser Requiring No
 Glassworking?</A></h3>

(From: George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com).)
<p>
Yes, it's possible because I have done it.  The trick is to mill or saw a 1/2
inch aluminum plate to hold the window at 56 degrees to the axis of a hole you
drill through it to receive the small bore laser tube.  A side hole connects
with this hole into which is glued a nipple for attachment to a vacuum system.
Drill and tap a 6-32 hole somewhere for a screw to attach a wire because this
piece is also an electrode.  The one I made had a few extra square inches
extending below so that I could put it in a beaker of water to dissipate the
heat from the electrode. The allowable temperature of the aluminum is limited
by the heat tolerance of the Epoxy you use to glue it together.  Mine was a DC
laser so only one end (the cathode) needed to be this large.
<p>
A photo of that part of the tube is shown in
<A HREF="noglwrk1.jpg">Cathode-End of Home-Built HeNe Laser Requiring No
Glassworking</A>.  The aluminum block cathode and negative power supply lead
can be seen with the Brewster window glued to its angled surface.  The glowing
bore of the tube extends toward the upper left corner.  For scale, the
platform is 3 inch aluminum channel and that's one of my early (white)
alignment cards in the lower right.
<p>
The anode was similar but without the heat sink and vacuum attachment.  Keep
the kids away from it and/or make arrangements to insulate the high voltage
electrode electrically but not thermally. 
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Sputtering at the negative electrode would be my other concern.  If it is
near the Brewster window or internal OC mirror, a metal coating could form
quite quickly, rendering the laser useless.  I would recommend locating the
cathode a few inches away - perhaps it could be a second aluminum block or an
aluminum tube attached to the end of a glass side-arm glued into the block
described above.  The advantage of this geometry is that there is no direct
line-of-sight path to the optics and thus sputtered material is much less
likely to land there.  Putting a few heat sink fins on this should provide
adequate cooling if it becomes more than warm to the touch.
<p>
Even simpler: Use common pipe fittings at each end, one being a "T" for a
side-arm mounted glass extension to which the aluminum cathode is attached.

<h3><A NAME="chn100m">How about a 100 METER Long HeNe Laser?</A></h3>

This one is probably for the fantasy department but, hey, perhaps that
unused LINAC tunnel you have in your basement left over from the defunct
SSC project could be put to good use. :)
<p>
(From: George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com).)
<p>
Here is a laser design that I planned 35 years ago but never built.  If
you want to try it out you are welcome to it.
<p>
If one wanted to make a really long laser, one way to keep the 3.391 um
radiation suppressed would be to stick a glass (not quartz, remember?)
Brewster window in the optical path every 50 to 100 centimeters.  Also, if
we want to maintain the conditions of a conventional laser, we need to
refocus the light rays periodically along the length.  So the Brewster
thing needs to be a lens rather than just a window.  But a lens tilted to 57
degrees would have terrific astigmatism.  OK, then have the window start with
a reverse astigmatism such that when tilted to 57 degrees the astigmatism
vanishes.  Or, use a normal lens that is AR coated.  If the AR coatings are
really good then tilt should be unnecessary.  (Note that the standard formulas
for reflectivity won't work at an AR coated surface - I don't know if there is
a Brewster angle for an AR coated surface.)
<p>
The change in focal length from tilt is a relatively simple matter for
concave reflectors (cosine for one direction, 1/cosine for the other), but
for lenses it is more complex.  I did a rough check on focus of a tilted
lens at 0, 30, and 60 degrees and it showed that the focal distance (can we
still call it focal length?) is the original focal length times the square of
the cosine of the tilt angle for focus in the plane of the tilt and times the
square root of the cosine of the tilt angle in the orthogonal plane.  Then
I did some more exact ray measurements on the computer and instead of
cos<sup>2</sup>.  I found it was closer to cos<sup>2.55</sup>. (Close,
but not exact).  I contemplated computing the focus in the other plane but
decided that was too much bother since I don't even know if anyone is going
to read this. (Well, read?, yes; build?, hmmm. --- Sam.)
<p>
Therefore the lens/window, if it is to have a tilted focal length of 50
cm, should have a conventionally-measured focal length of 220 cm in one
plane. and 67 cm the other way.  The practical way to get such a lens is to
deal with a manufacturer of spectacle lenses, so we have to translate to
diopters and  round to the nearest 1/8 diopter.  Thus we end up with a
refractive power of 0.50 diopters in one direction and 1.5 diopters in the
other direction yielding tilted focal lengths of 45 cm and 50 cm (close
enough).   I guess the optometrist would call for "sph. +.50 , cyl +1.00".
Make sure your lens maker understands that these curvatures are relative to
a flat surface on both sides, or you may find you are given a lens that is
strongly concave on one side as in standard spectacles.  Perhaps each
surface should be described as  sph +.25 ,  cyl +.50. Check with the lens man.
<p>
After having one made and checking it out, order as many as you want
for your laser.  Each section has its own power supply and glass system
(with a shared window)  and they  can be tested and added one section at a
time.  The completed design as I see it is a multiple confocal system with
end mirrors of 100 cm radius and intermediate lens/windows with 50 cm focal
lengths every 100 cm.  The windows nearest the mirrors are flat.  When
testing an incomplete assembly the second concave mirror should be 100 cm
away from the last lens/window.
<p>
In my imaginary design of this laser, each section has a glass ball joint
near a window so that each section can be adjusted to be collinear with the
rest, but I can also see it running as one huge glued-together contraption.
After enough sections are added, it should lase without a terminating
mirror, and this suggests that by that time it would have lost coherence.
Who'd like to predict how much power it will  produce?  Who'd like to
predict what limits the power?

<h2>Alternatives to Constructing an HeNe Laser from Scratch</h2>

OK, so you really want to play with an external mirror HeNe laser but don't
have access to the resources, a suitable work area, or more likely, the
determination to deal with the glassworking, vacuum, gas fill, and other
requirements of a totally home-built HeNe tube.
<p>
The following sections describe various ways of ending up with a working HeNe
laser that don't require quite as much in the way of support equipment and
supplies as building one from the ground up.  These include morphing a
commercial HeNe tube into a home-built HeNe laser, using commercial one and
two-Brewster HeNe laser tubes with your own resonator, and even a way of
converting a cheap barcode scanner HeNe tube into a precision frequency
stabilized laser.   While perhaps not quite as rewarding as doing everything
from scratch, the likelihood of success, particularly with the latter
approaches, is much much greater.
<p>
Taking an existing HeNe tube and using it as the foundation for an external
mirror laser would eliminate some of the hassle of constructing everything
from scratch.  Specifically, most glass work would be eliminated and by doing
things in stages, the risks are somewhat reduced.
<p>
If you don't want to even think about vacuum systems and gas supplies,
HeNe (and Ar ion) plasma tubes with Brewster windows for use with an external
cavity ARE available from various sources.  With one of these in-hand, and a
matching conventional power supply (commercial or home-built), you can still
experience the joy and frustration of constructing and aligning an external
mirror laser head.  I've even gotten lasing from a HeNe tube with a damaged
OC mirror using an external mirror though I doubt there is another similar
tube in the entire Universe so perhaps that isn't quite fair. :)
<p>
It then is *just* a matter of fabricating the laser platform and mirror
mounts, and obtaining a pair of suitable mirrors.  There would be NO excuse
for failure!
<p>
However, the problem is that since such tubes are a lot less common - and
mostly used as replacements in expensive high quality research lasers, their
cost is considerable.  Figure $600 to $1,000 or more depending on quality,
size, and supplier.  Check out the large well known HeNe laser manufacturers.
Perhaps, if you can convince them it is for an educational project, they might
let you have one that doesn't quite meet their specs for free or at cost.
<p>
Perhaps, after successfully constructing a laser head in this manner, you will
have the confidence to proceed with a totally home-built design.  The
continuing saga of my (so far less than entirely successful) experience with
this approach follows in the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsdiy">Sam's DIY External Mirror HeNe Laser - Some
Assembly Required!</A>.
<p>
The opposite situation is also a possibility: Build your own HeNe plasma tube
but mount it in a used resonator.  Depending on your resources, this might be
an easier task (though I find that hard to imagine!).  External cavity HeNe
laser heads with dead tubes seem to turn up much more frequently than the
other way around (for obvious reasons) and can often be obtained at attractive
prices.  In fact, the dead tube one of these contains might be a candidate for
regassing!

<h2>Sam's Three Part Process for Getting Your Feet Wet in Gas Lasers</h2>

The amount of preparation, acquisition of materials and equipment, and actual
work that will be needed to construct a gas laser from scratch can be
intimidating.  So, here is a way of getting into it somewhat gradually.
<p>
You will need the vacuum setup and a source of the HeNe gas mixture, but the
serious glass working can be postponed for another day.
<p>
The basic idea will be to start off with a laser resonator that once worked
(a commercial HeNe tube) using a regular HeNe laser power supply.  Inexpensive
HeNe tubes and power supplies are readily available and therefore, much of the
uncertainty can be easily eliminated so you can concentrate on the gas and
vacuum issues.

<h3><A NAME="chnchn6">Part 1: Regassing a Sealed HeNe Tube</A></h3>

This series of steps will allow you to replace or renew the HeNe gas in a
common sealed HeNe tube with minimal fuss.  If you are doing this to revive a
tube (rather than to build your own laser), then Step 1 won't be needed!
<p>
<ol>
<li>Locate a dead HeNe tube - or sacrifice one in the interests of science.
 (However, for the sacrifice, you <b>will</b> need to provide the
 appropriate chants and incantations to the "gods of dead lasers"!)
 What I mean by this is to start with a tube that is known to be in good
 physical condition - it worked out each day, took its vitamins, etc. :-)
 Maybe it is old and tired and needs new gas; perhaps it lases but is weak;
 or maybe you have 149 others like it and the overcrowding is unbearable.
 Since suitable HeNe tubes can be purchased for as little as $5 (possibly
 even less - see the chapter: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts
 Sources</A>) this isn't a huge investment.  However, it must have been
 known to work - messing with mirror alignment is NOT something you really
 want to deal with - trust me!  At least, not until Part 2.
<p>
 I would recommend something in the 5 to 10 mW range - large enough to be
 interesting but not so long as to possibly require magnets or other special
 attention to operate reliably.
<p>
<li>Very carefully breach the vacuum by nicking the end of the exhaust tube
 with a file - just enough so that the air goes in but you don't want to
 make a big hole yet because if there is any vacuum remining, it will suck
 in all sorts of junk.  File all around the (metal) tube just to the point
 where it is about to crack but not all the way through as this will deposit
 metal particles and who-knows-what-else inside the tube.  Once it is up to
 air, break off the tip and with as little delay as possible (i.e., minutes,
 not days), Epoxy a short length of metal or glass tubing to the remaining
 stub and cap the end until you will be actually pumping it down.  This is
 your new exhaust port.  With care, there will be only minimal contamination
 so an extensive bake-out will not be needed.  A high vacuum needle valve
 can be added to make it semi-removable (but don't *count* on long life from
 your regassed tube).
<p>
<li>Hook this up to your vacuum/gas supply system.  The gas valve to your HeNe
 bottle/cylinder/ampule should be closed and the vacuum valve to the pump(s)
 open.
<p>
<li>Pump it down as far as it will go (hopefully, this is a very small fraction
 of a Torr since you want it to be much less than the 2 to 5 Torr of working
 pressure for the HeNe mixture).
<p>
<li>Power it up using a power supply designed for the type of tube you are
 using!  Note: Make sure the negative output of your power supply is at
 ground potential - else it will try to discharge through the vacuum hose to
 the pump earth ground!
<p>
 WARNING: The anode will be at a kV or more with respect to everything else!
 Cover, shield, or otherwise insulated it from accidental contact.
<p>
<li>Close the vacuum valve and open the gas valve a smidgen while monitoring
 pressure to raise the pressure of the HeNe mixture in the tube to its
 operating range of 2 to 5 Torr.
<p>
<li>Watch the color of the discharge and look for a laser beam.  Once the gas
 fill has been purged of air and other contaminants and the pressure is
 within the required 2 to 5 Torr range, the color will stabilize with the
 familiar unsaturated redish-orange of a normal HeNe laser tube discharge.
<p>
<li>Depending on how high a vacuum your pump(s) can achieve and how much
 contamination was in the tube, you may have to repeat steps 4 to 7 several
 times.  If the interior of the tube was not exposed to ambient conditions
 for any significant time, hopefully, no actual baking of the tube will be
 needed.
<p>
<li>Where your vacuum system isn't that great (e.g., not able to get down to
 .01 Torr or better as with a single stage rotary pump) a flowing gas (or
 at least a flow through gas) system can be used - add a second port at the
 opposite end of the HeNe tube from the exhaust tube and use this for the
 gas supply.
<p>
 WARNING: Where this fill port is attached to the anode as is likely, not
 only must you take extreme care in working with anything connected to it,
 but there will have to be a long narrow gas flow path to prevent the high
 voltage from striking between the tube anode and the gas supply cylinder
 instead of the tube cathode.  Even if your gas supply system is electrical
 isolated from ground, its large capacitance to free space would make
 powering the HeNe tube difficult.
<p>
<li>Experiment with power supply voltage/current, gas pressure, and He:Ne ratio
 if you have that option.  Have fun!
</ol>
<p>
Note that while you should be to achieve a sufficiently pure gas fill for
the tube to lase, don't expect this to permit you to regas an old tired
HeNe tube, seal it off, and expect it to generate rated power or last any
significant amount of time (either just according to the calendar or hours
of use).  An extremely good vacuum, ultra-pure gases, bake out to eliminate
all contamination, a new or reactivated getter, and some luck would be
required for that to succeed.  See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr">Repairing Leaky or Broken HeNe Tubes</A> for
more information.
<p>
A nice description of HeNe laser reprocessing which includes this can be
found at <A HREF="http://www.technology.niagarac.on.ca/people/mcsele/lasers/LasersHeNe.htm">Mark Csele's Helium-Neon Lasers Page</A>.  There is even
info on adapting a commercial HeNe laser tube to run as a pulsed neon-only
laser.

<h3><A NAME="chnchn7">Part 2: Adding External Mirrors</A></h3>

Now that you have successfully regassed and 'revived' a commercial HeNe tube
(even if temporarily), it is time to go one step further: Replacing one or
both mirrors/mounts with Brewster windows and using the original
mirrors/mounts to build an external resonator.  In the following discussion,
I assume that both mirrors are replaced.  However, it would be much simpler
to just replace one - I would suggest the OC.  Then, with the HR untouched,
mirror alignment becomes much less of a hassle and unknown.  The result would
then be equivalent to a one-Brewster HeNe Laser.  See the sections starting
with: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsltb">Sam's One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube
Conversion</A>.
<p>
Note: For this to work, both mirrors must be planar (which is difficult to
align especially for a long narrow bore resonator) or must have a focal length
significantly longer than the original tube length - otherwise, the added
distance between them when mounted externally will mess up the cavity
relationship that would have been present where one or both was concave.
<p>
In addition, it is almost certain that the reflectivity of the Output Coupler
(OC) mirror - the one at the output-end of the laser that were part of the HeNe
tube in the first place - will be too low for anything approaching optimal
performance (and perhaps not even have enough gain to lase at all) once the
losses through the Brewster windows are taken into account (especially those
that aren't perfectly clean, high enough quality, and not exactly at the
correct angle).  Therefore, higher reflectivity optics for the OC with a
curvature optimized for an external mirror HeNe tube similar in length to your
creation should probably be used from the start to avoid a lot of frustration.
<p>
Note, however, that for clean, fused silica, very flat Brewster windows set
at the proper angle, losses can be very low and even short one-Brewster HeNe
tubes (e.g., 10 inches between HR and Brewster window) have enough gain to
lase easily with quite low reflectance OCs (e.g., 97 or 98 percent - typical
of the OCs in 25 to 30 inch internal mirror HeNe tubes.  So, you may get away
with using the original OCs if your Brewsters cooperate. :)
<p>
Another option is to forgo red entirely until you have something that lases at
all and go for one of the IR lines: 1,162.3 nm, 1,523.1 nm, or 3,391.3 nm.
I may be easier to get a short tube to opaerte - even one that won't work at
all for red, especially at that last one - which will even lase superradiantly
(without mirrors) in a moderate length tube.  Of course, suitable
optics will be needed as well as some means of detecting the IR.  A silicon
photodiode, CCD camera, or IR detector card can be used for the 1,162.3 nm
wavelength; a phosphor plate or something else for the longer ones.  Take
special care if you do this as the IR is, of course, invisible, but can still
cause eye damage.  Personally, I'd go with the red - it's challenging but
doable.

<ol>
<li>Fabricate a pair of Brewster window assemblies.  These can be made from a
 glass or metal tube 1 or 2 inches long cut at the required Brewster angle
 for the type of optical material you will be using for the flats.  Quartz
 or fused silica optical flats are best for the windows since the these
 absorb less light (which is converted to heat) but also transmit the usually
 unwanted 3,391 nm wavelength.  (See the section:
 <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnwnqw">Why Not to use Quartz Windows for a Visible
 HeNe Laser</A>.)  For visible wavelengths, borosilicate crown glass flats
 are nearly as good.  High quality super clean microscope slides may also
 work with suitable mirrors (though probably not that well).  See the
 section: <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao1">Optical Windows</A>.
<p>
 One possible inexpensive or free source for high quality Brewster windows
 is a defunct external mirror HeNe tube - but if you had one, you would
 probably be using <i>that</i> to build this apparatus entirely!  Another
 possibility is a dead one-Brewster HeNe tube or a Hughes style polarized
 HeNe tube (which may actually be a one-Brewster HeNe tube with an external
 OC mirror glued to its Brewster stem).  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao2">Determining Brewster angle</A>.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>A metal tube for mounting the Brewster window can be cut using a
  hacksaw or band saw and then carefully filed or sanded smooth and flat
  (at the required angle) and cleaned.  A glass tube is best cut on a
  diamond wet saw though the jig described in "Light and its Uses" for the
  HeNe laser can also be used.  It will then need to be lapped to make a
  nearly gas tight fit.
<p>
 <li>For a permanent assembly, the inside diameter of this tube should be
  such that they can be slipped snuggly over the portion of the mirror
  mount attached to the ends of the HeNe tube once the adjustable section
  has been removed.  For testing, it may better to make the diameter about
  the same as the mirror mount stub and use a short piece of vacuum hose
  and hose clamps to attach the Brewster window assembly to the tube.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Use Epoxy to attach the windows to the tubes and let them set for a
 couple of days.  Then clean them inside and out with denatured alcohol.
<p>
<li>After allowing air to enter the tube slowly if it wasn't already up to air,
 remove the mirrors from both ends of the tube (or one end only if you want to
 take this gradually).  If you want to save the mirrors, see the section:
 <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpsplt">Salvaging Parts From a Laser Tube</A>.  Else,
 you can use more violence to remove just the glass from the ends of the
 mirror mounts.  Retaining the restricted section will permit the Brewster
 angle to be adjusted slightly even for the permanently attached Brewster
 window assemblies.  However, there is risk that the mirror(s) may break or
 chip during removal.
<p>
 Or, to keep the mirrors intact and mounted, use a file to score around
 the thin section to the point just before the metal is penetrated.  Snap
 off the mount and immediate cap the end(s) of the tube to minimize the
 possibility of contamination.  Don't remove the mirror glass from the metal
 mounts - they are more convenient to handle.  Put each mirror/mount in s
 little plastic bag and set them aside in a tightly capped container until
 needed.  (Even if, as recommended, you start with an OC mirror designed for
 use with an external mirror HeNe tube, after you get the thing lasing, you
 can go back and try the original OC to determine if it will work at all.)
<p>
<li>After making sure the inside surfaces of the Brewster windows are super
 clean, attach the assemblies to the ends of the tube using Epoxy (permanent)
 or the piece of vacuum hose and hose clamps (temporary) taking.  For the
 permanent connection, it is critical that the angle is properly set!
<p>
<li>Fabricate one of the mirror mounts described in the sections starting
 with: <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao4">Adjustable Mirror Mounts</A> or
 any of those constructed for the lasers described starting in the section:
 <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnchn9">The Half-Way Approach for a Home-Built
 HeNe Laser</A>.  Attach the mirror(s) of your choice to the movable plate
 with glue, clips, or screws.
<p>
<li>Use one of the alignment techniques from "Light and its Uses" or a green
 HeNe laser as described in the section:
 <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argail">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Cleaning and
 Alignment Techniques</A> (these apply to other lasers as well) to align the
 mirrors without the modified HeNe tube installed.
<p>
<li>Mount the modified HeNe tube in position between the mirrors, fire up the
 pumps and power supply and have fun!
</ol>

Make sure EVERYTHING is immaculate!  With a low gain laser like this (a red
HeNe), even a speck of dust in the wrong place can cut output power way down
or kill lasing entirely.  At best, it will make alignment much more difficult;
at worst it will make it impossible to ever get any kind of beam.  See the
information on optics cleaning in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrcln">Cleaning of Laser Optics</A>.  This isn't like
an internal mirror HeNe laser where you can mess up the quality of the beam
with a strategically located smudge but it will still lase just fine - that
fingerprint will make it impossible for enough photons to bounce back and
forth to maintain oscillation at all!
<p>
If you really want to experiment, are doing this with an HeNe tube that was
originally 30 cm or longer, and have a high frustration threshold, obtain
a set of mirrors designed for an 'other color' HeNe tube and see if you
can get something other than coherent red light from your contraption!
<p>
Note that even getting a short external mirror HeNe laser (e.g., bore length
less than 30 cm or so) to operate on the red 632.8 nm wavelength may be
difficult unless everything is perfect.  And, there aren't that many commercial
external mirror HeNe lasers in 'colors' other than red or IR - the gain is
even lower than for red on the orange, yellow, and green lines so losses must
be cut down to as near zero as possible!  The very slight reflection from even
high quality Brewster windows may be enough to prevent lasing unless the bore
is long.  Hint: Green has to lowest gain of the common 'other HeNe colors' so
I would suggest avoiding that, at least until you have succeeded at yellow or
orange! :)

<h3><A NAME="chnchn8">Part 3: Using Your Own HeNe Glass Work</A></h3>

Now that you have a working 'Frankenstein' HeNe laser - one using a few
transplanted parts - it should be a simple matter to substitute a fully
home-blown tube of your own.  I would recommend using a bore length of
around 30 cm for a 632.8 nm visible red output with standard dielectric HeNe
laser mirrors.  This is long enough to produce a decent output power but short
enough so that the tendency to oscillate at the very strong IR spectral lines
is manageable without the use of arrays of magnets - thought these could be
added to improve performance.
<p>
You can use a pair of identical electrodes and the AC power supply described
in "Light and its Uses".  However, it would also be possible (with just a
little more glass-work) to provide a large side-tube (which also provides a
much greater gas reservoir) and aluminum (can) cathode as in commercial tubes
with a regular HeNe (DC) laser power supply.

<h3><A NAME="chnsltb">Sam's One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube Conversion</A></h3>

The following is a preliminary works-in-progress:
<p>
I have had a 30 inch long HeNe laser tube with a broken-off OC mirror (from
overzealous attempts at alignment, don't ask!) sitting in a box in the attic
for a couple of years now.  It never really worked quite right anyhow with
erratic power fluctuations and didn't come anywhere near its 20 mW rating even
when all the planets were precisely aligned. :)  The cause is unknown -
possibly low gain due to a contaminated gas fill resulting in low gain.  This
tube seemed like it would be ideal for creating a nice long semi-home-built
one-Brewster laser.  And, I wouldn't feel at all guilty about making
irreversible modifications - no chants or incantations required for the "gods
of dead lasers" either! ;-)  The HR mirror is known to be in good condition and
properly aligned and there is a nice hole where the OC mirror used to be (the
OC has since been reassigned to other projects and works fine so the tube's
original problems weren't due to the OC).  The exhaust tube is nice and long
(about 3 inches) - apparently, this tube never actually was totally completed.
It is also one of those peculiar HeNe tubes described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henish1">Segmented HeNe Tubes</A>.  I expect this to be
an advantage since the gas reservoir ends up being distributed throughout the
bore and there should be less 'pumping' of gas from one end to the other by
the current in the discharge.  (Since I have a couple of other more normal
tubes from the same source that also experience the lack of power and
instability, I don't believe that is related to the segmented design.)
<p>
A diagram of the proposed assembly is shown in <A HREF="obtconv1.gif">Sam's One
Brewster Helium-Neon Laser Tube Conversion</A>.
<p>
To accommodate my mediocre vacuum system, I intend to construct this as a
flowing gas system.  So, I will drill a hole for the gas fill port in the
end-plate at the anode-end of the tube (the exhaust tube is, as usual,
at the cathode-end) and attach a piece of metal capillary tubing to it
with Epoxy.
<p>
I will attach the well cleaned Brewster stem salvaged from a Hughes style one
Brewster HeNe tube to the OC mount stump.  Although the diagram shows a sleeve
and Epoxy seal, I may use a threaded pipe fitting so that the Brewster window
can be easily removed or replaced if needed, or some other optic like an OC
mirror could be substituted if desired.  For initial testing, I have installed
a piece of clear plastic tubing and a pair of small pipe clamps.  This
probably won't retain a decent vacuum but should work for flowing gas
operation.  And, the angle of the Brewster window can be adjusted if needed!
<p>
The external OC mirror will be mounted on an adjustable plate with everything
attached to a rigid base.
<p>
My SP-255 exciter on a Variac should be satisfactory for powering this
laser.
<p>

<h2>Sam's DIY External Mirror HeNe Laser - Some Assembly Required!</h2>

As noted in the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnchn9">The Half-Way Approach
for a Home-Built HeNe Laser</A>, if you aren't really into glasswork and
vacuum systems, it is still possible to experience much of the challenge and
feeling of accomplishment by building a laser using a commercial tube and
external resonator.
<p>
I acquired an external mirror HeNe tube for this exact purpose.  Physically,
the body of the tube looks like a Melles Griot internal mirror type (but
no manufacturer label).  Probably the closest current model would be the
05-LHR-120 HeNe tube used in the 05-LHR-121 laser head which is rated at
2 mW.  Additional info can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht0">Typical HeNe Tube Specifications</A>.
<p>
However, instead of the normal mirror mounts and internal mirrors, it has a
pair of Brewster windows.  Although such HeNe tubes are manufactured for
use in research lasers, I suspect this was a one-of-a-kind for another reason:
In Magic Marker on the side is printed: He<sup>3</sup>, Ne<sup>22</sup>, 2.8,
which I assume refers to the isotope of helium and neon used in the gas fill
and the gas fill pressure (2.8 Torr).  Ordinary HeNe tubes may use normal
He<sup>4</sup> and Ne<sup>20</sup> so my guess is that this was manufactured
for someone's thesis project with a title like: "Determination of How Lasing
Spectral Characteristics are Affected by Gas Isotope".  The consensus is that
isotope differences will have only minimal effect - and this is supported by
my measurements.  See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioispg">Performing
the Single Pass Gain Test</A>.
<p>
Actually, having said that before I know what I was talking about (assuming
I do now!), the upper energy state of He<sup>3</sup> is slightly
closer to that of Ne<sup>20</sup> so energy transfer is more efficient
and thus gain will be modestly higher for a given tube length.  This is
particularly critical for "other-color" HeNe lasers where every bit of gain
is critical.  But apparently, virtually all modern HeNe lasers, regardless
of color, are now filled with He<sup>3</sup>.  See the additional comments
below.
<p>
Tubes with Brewster windows are available from several companies including
<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.jodon.com/">Jodon</A>.  Sizes from 10 cm to over 100 cm
(between the centers of the Brester windows) are available which will operate
at the 632.8 nm (red) HeNe wavelength.  My funny tube has a length of about 25
cm so it is well within this range.  This tube appears to be similar to a
Melles Griot 05-LHB-290 Brewster tube except for the strange gas fill.  Thus,
if manufactured properly (e.g., with the proper Brewster angle and properly
aligned windows), it should work!

<h3><A NAME="chndhbr">Description of the Home-Built Resonator</A></h3>

To make use of this tube, I needed to construct a resonator and mirror mounts
and provide mirrors.  This is shown in <A HREF="twobrew1.gif">HeNe Laser Tube
with Two-Brewster Windows Mounted in Home-Built Resonator</A> (not to scale)
and <A HREF="twobrp1.jpg">Photo of Home-Built Two-Brewster HeNe Laser</A>.
<p>
For the resonator frame, I used some aluminum scrap from an old chart recorder
and 9 track tape drive (Like the perverbial cow, I use nearly everything!).
Low expansion InVar or something else equally exotic and expensive would be
better, but given my machine shop or lack thereof, I would much rather deal
with aluminum!
<p>
<ul>
<li>The baseplate is 13"(L) x 2-3/4"(W) x 5/16".
<li>The end-plates are 2-3/4"(W) x 3"(H) x 5/16".
<li>There are also a pair of stabilizing rods 13"(L) x 1/2" x 3/8"
</ul>
Once drilled, tapped, and screwed together, this assembly is VERY rigid.
<p>
The mirror mount assembly consists of three parts: a fine adjustment plate,
a coarse adjustment plate, and a small slotted adapter to which the mirror
optic itself is attached.
<p>
<ol>
<li>On each end is an adjustable mirror plate similar to the design shown in:
 <A HREF="mmount2.gif">Adjustable Mirror Mount 2</A> except that instead of
 thumbscrews and springs, it uses cap screws (hex wrench adjustment) and split
 washers, respectively.  This is similar to the scheme used with the ALC-60X
 argon ion laser head.  The total adjustment range is only about 1 degree but
 this should be more than enough once the coarse adjustment is done.
<p>
<li>The coarse adjustment is similar to the fine adjustment but is smaller and
 attaches on to it with three smaller cap screws again using lock washers
 instead of springs.
<p>
<li>The optics are mounted on a plate with oversize holes to permit some
 adjustment in X and Y to line up the center of the mirror with the bore of
 the tube.
</ol>
<p>
The tube itself (henceforth called the 'Tube Under Test' or TUT) is mounted by
a couple of aluminum brackets and Plexiglas plates with the anode-end on
ceramic insulators.  The ballast resistor is also mounted on the frame with a
Plexiglas cover to prevent accidental contact with the high voltage terminals.
There is even a HV Warning sticker - what a concept!  Power is provided via a
4 foot HV coax terminated in a male Alden connector.
<p>
Once this was all constructed, I checked that it would power up and then
evaluated the TUT for gain.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioispg">Performing the Single Pass Gain Test</A>.

<h3><A NAME="chnssmi">Salvaging Some Mirrors</A></h3>

To get it to actually lase, I of course, need mirrors.  My intention is to
initially select mirrors that will give me the greatest chance of getting some
coherent output - even if it is weak.  Ideally, this means high reflectance
for the OC to minimize gain requirements and some curvature to ease alignment.
In the end, what I selected were mirrors from a certifiably dead-dead
Melles Griot 05-LHR-002-246, a 5 inch long .5 to 1 mW internal mirror tube, a
type used in HeNe laser based hand-held barcode scanners.
<p>
This one in particular must have been dropped since the capillary had broken
completely off of its attachment at the anode-end of the tube and was rattling
around inside.  Given this state of affairs, I would expect the "gods of dead
lasers" to understand the need for the sacrifice since I could think of
absolutely no way it could ever be made to lase again (but I did provide the
appropriate chants and so forth just to be sure!).
<p>
After evaluating several options on exactly how to remove the mirrors
(retaining various amounts of the rest of the tube), I decided to cut them off
at the narrow section of the mirror mount.  This would minimize the possibility
of damage to the optics while at the same time providing a convenient metal
collar to attach to my mirror mount plate.  To minimize contamination, rather
than using a hacksaw or file, I scored a line with a sharp pair of wire
cutters and then snapped them off.  Then, I cleaned up the rough edges with
a file after stuffing a the hole to prevent the entrance of metal particles.
<p>
Well, since I pulled those mirrors off the little dead tube, I haven't heard
of any global disasters so I guess the "gods of dead lasers" (GODLs) are
satisfied with my chants. :)  I did break a set of wire cutters trying
to score a line (maybe that was my payment to the GODLs).
<p>
To mount the mirrors, I drilled a hole in each of my plates so they would
retain their position by a press-fit.  Then, with all the mirror mount screws
tightened down, the plates with the mirrors were attached.  To confirm that
the mirrors were seated approximately correctly, I used my alignment HeNe
laser to check for a return beam down the bore of the TUT.  It didn't have
to be exact (the coarse and fine adjustments will take care of that), but
I wanted to be sure it wasn't really far off.  A bead of Epoxy then assured
that each mirror would stay in the proper position.
<p>
However, now I have 3 unknowns:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Mirror alignment - This <b>will</b> be a real !@#$.  My frame is about 15
 inches long and they are planar mirrors. :(  It was enough of a pain in the
 you-know-what aligning my ALC-60X which is (1) shorter, (2) has a curved
 OC, and (3) passes HeNe red for alignment.  I really don't want to fire up
 an argon ion laser for this.
<p>
<li>Absolute single pass gain of funny tube.  I really can't measure that as
 noted previously beyond saying that it looks close.  So while I believe it
 to be positive, unable to confirm or quantify.
<p>
<li>Reflectance/transmission, quality, and cleanliness of mirrors.  With less
 than 2 percent gain, it doesn't take much to kill lasing.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="chnaa1">Attempting Alignment 1</A></h3>

I already knew that alignment would be quite difficult, especially with
planar mirrors.  What I really need is a set of mirrors with a radius of
curvature about equal to the length of my resonator to form a confocal
cavity.  this would be much easier to align than a planar-planar configuration.
Until then, I am stuck with what I have.
</ol>
I played with alignment for a few hours but without any flashes.  So, I
decided to measure the transmission of each of the mirrors I had available.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Transmission of OC from 5 inch HeNe tube: .7 percent.
<li>Transmission of OC from large-frame Spectra-Physics HeNe laser: .6 percent.
</ul>
<p>
All the HRs tested at less than .1 percent transmission.
<p>
I know that I only have 2 percent to play with excluding losses through the
Brewsters!  So, these mirrors at least should be acceptable as long as the
losses through the Brewsters are less than 1.3 percent or so.  However, to
have the best chance, I can just use an HR from another little tube (already
have it so no need for sacrifices as someone else already went through that
ritual) to see if I can get it lasing at all, then worry about the OC to get
some power out at one end.  Or, use Sam's special means of extracting power -
a plate inside the cavity at almost the Brewster angle - 2 beams for the price
of one! :)
<p>
(From: Daniel Ames)
<p>
Maybe my BEFIA (Beam Expansion for Interference Alignment Method) might come
in handy with this one.  (I guess that title sure could use some rewording, as
the abbreviation sounds like a "beef processors union". :)
<p>
Important note: Be sure to offer the HeNe alignment chant, FIRST!
<ol>
<li>Secure the reference laser (R-Laser).
<p>
<li>Mark the exact spot of the beam on the (stationary) viewing card with a
 cross.
<p>
<li>Add to the beam (past where the TUT will be), your best lens and center so 
 you get the most concentric looking pattern, centered on the cross and secure
 the lens (with tape).
<p>
<li>Insert the TUT into the beam and by monitoring the (new) position of
 the  beam's spot and the interference patterns, produced by reflection off
 the TUT's cavity walls, try to get the spot back to the "center" of the cross.
 Then fine tune the TUT's alignment to make the interference patterns
 concentrically on axis with the cross's center.
<p>
<li>The TUT must be secured (without moving it). I found that Steve
 Roberts' idea of using tape, preferably the 2" wide packaging tape, works
 pretty well for this.
<p>
<li>Now align the mirror that is closest to the R-Laser, so that you get more
 interference - from the reflected beam from the R-Laser's OC and back through
 the TUT and lens, when viewed against the cross.
<p>
<li>Fine tune the first mirror to get the new interference more centered with
 the  cross and the interference rings to look as symmetrical as possible.
<p>
<li>Now, repeat steps (6) and (7) on the 2nd mirror without moving anything.
</ol>
<p>
NOTE: This can be done with the same color HeNe, but the reflections will be 
substantially reduced in intensity.  So, if using the same color R-Laser,
(HeNe) use a bright fluorescent sticker or card for the viewing screen and dim
the lights.
<p>
This procedure should only take a minute or two of your time, or forever.
Your mileage my vary. :)
<p>
On your alignment jig, have you thought of any way other than the manual 
(slip and slide) method for lateral adjustment?
<p>
Geometrically speaking, it is much easier to move the TUT for aligning, 
than the reference laser. It works out to be a much less critical movement.
The distance of movement of say 1/100th of a degree times the distance 
between the two lasers, is much greater than 1/100th of a degree times
the length of just the TUT.  It makes dialing in the alignment much easier,
especially if the distance between the two lasers is more than the absolute
minimum. 
<p>
My (unorthodox) method:
<p>
It's reversed from the norm. I put the TUT on the alignment jig, and the 
reference laser was just positioned and secured at the approximate center of
the jig's vertical and horizontal travel.  
<p>
Although with my (unorthodox) method, the TUT still needs to somehow secured 
to the Jig. 
<p>
Either way, what about putting a piece of metal, maybe aluminum, under the
TUT for a smoother lateral positioning?  Just a thought, maybe you already
thought of this. :)
<p>
But I'm sure that you have a plan. :)
<p>
(From: Sam)
<p>
Right...  I am quite convinced that alignment of the A-Laser relative to the
TUT's bore really isn't a problem at this point.

<h3><A NAME="chnaa2">Attempting Alignment 2</A></h3>

After a few weeks, off and on, of attempting to obtain output from this laser,
I am wondering if I need to go back and seriously attempt to determine whether
the tube has a net greater than unity absolute single pass gain.
<p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried several different sets of HeNe mirrors including a pair of
 HRs from some unknown model internal mirror HeNe tubes donated to the cause
 (no sacrifices required), the OC from the 20 inch resonator of an ancient
 HeNe laboratory laser, and combinations of these with the mirrors from my 5
 inch HeNe tube.
<p>
 I would have expected the reflectivity of the OC from that old laser to be
 similar to what was required for my funny tube because although its tube
 was (past tense, no longer intact) much longer, the bore was about twice as
 wide resulting in lower gain/inch.  That OC is also curved which should ease
 alignment requirements.  Unfortunately, I couldn't try the HR because it had
 been damaged.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henish4">A Really Old
 HeNe Laser</A> for a description of that laser.
<p>
<li>My home-built resonator frame is quite stable - more so than I had at
 first expected.  It is possible to set the mirrors very precisely and they
 stay put.
<p>
<li>I am quite sure that I am getting the far-mirror (from the A-Laser) aligned
 well enough that adjustment of the near-mirror should result in lasing if
 conditions support it.  The HR mirrors all seem to have some 'wedge' which
 complicates the alignment of the near-mirror somewhat (using the reflected
 beam method) but I don't believe this to be the problem as I've rocked it
 enough to cover the slight offset that results from the wedge.
</ul>
<p>
However, there have as yet been no confirmed sightings of any flashes
regardless of which optics were used, the phase of the moon, or wishful
thinking. :(
<p>
At this point I am therefore left with 2 of the 3 unknowns: Absolute single
pass gain of the funny tube and the curvature, quality, and cleanliness of the
mirrors.  Or....
<p>
I just noticed that there is some possibility that the funny gas fill with
the non-standard isotopes of helium and neon might have been used to make this
HeNe tube producing a green beam at 543.5 nm.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht2">More on Other Color HeNe Lasers</A>.  However,
for all my tests, I have used red probe beams and mirrors designed to reflect
red at 632.8 nm.  Perhaps my problem all along is that I should have gone
green!

<h3><A NAME="chnsucc">Finally, Success (More or Less)!</A></h3>

Drum-roll please!  Is the crowd ready?? :)
<p>
After a pleasant interlude of getting a HeNe tube with a single Brewster
window to work (see the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henoneb">A One-Brewster
HeNe Laser Tube</A>), I returned to this effort.  I suspected that part of the
problem was that I hadn't paid enough attention to the cleanliness of the
Brewster windows.  With the one-Brewster tube, even a single spec of dust or
fine coating of who-knows-what could drastically reduce the output power.
With two Brewsters, such effects would be much worse.
<p>
So, I went back to optics from the large-frame Spectra-Physics laser (and are
what are shown in the photo, above).  I hoped
these would have the best chance of lasing short of a pair of long focal
length HRs which I currently don't have.  (The OC from the old lab laser might
be even better if it has higher reflectivity - I may try that in the future.)
<p>
I discovered that by watching the scatter from the Brewster window closest to
the alignment laser (A-Laser), it was possible to tweak the mirrors so that
the spot caused by the beam from A-Laser and the return from the HR mirror
at the other end of the tube could be superimposed.  If this was done with
the OC's reflection smack in the middle of the A-Laser's output aperture,
there would be an increase in intensity and fluctuations in intensity due to
mode cycling of the A-Laser and light bouncing back and forth between the
A-Laser's OC and the OC of my resonator.  At this point, alignment was really
very close.
<p>
While gently rocking the mirrors I got what were unmistakable flashes for the
first time.  More cleaning and blowing off of dust and I was finally able to
get a few photons of coherent 632.8 nm light coming from the funny tube.
<p>
Actually, a grand total of about 19 &micro;W.  (That's 19 whole microwatts - not
milliwatts or megawatts!)  It's a nice TEM00 beam - just not very bright! :)
<p>
Part of the problem may be that the inside of the Brewster on the cathode-end
of the funny tube seems to have a lot of scatter - about as much as I get from
the Brewster window of the one-Brewster tube with perhaps 100 times as much
circulating light flux between the Brewster and the OC.  How do you clean the
inner surface of a Brewster window on a sealed tube? :(
<p>
Another and perhaps more significant characteristic is that when first turned
on, the output power may be more than 2-1/2 times greater (more than 50 &micro;W!!)
and then decays to the lower value over the course of a minute or two.  If it
is turned off for a minute or two, the behavior will repeat.  This could
indicate a gas fill problem as I've seen similar behavior with an old
Spectra-Physics 084-1 soft-seal HeNe tube.  The mechanism would be that
discharge current is causing the gases to be redistributed to the detriment of
lasing gain or the optical power that can be extracted from the population
inversion (sounds impressive at least!).  The color of the discharge isn't
obviously incorrect but could be a bit more pink than normal, though the
spectrum appears normal.  However, I may attempt to reactivate the getter in
any case but this will have to wait until I get my induction heater working -
there is no way to do this easily with my solar heater or by loading the
entire laser into the microwave!  However, I have tried the RF exciter test
for gas fill problems and the results would seem to indicate that there is no
detectable contamination.
<p>
I do believe at present that my OC reflectivity is marginal and I should be
able to get a bit more power out of this tube by locating a mirror with
99.6% or greater reflectivity.  As noted, I have tried a couple of HRs (which
would certainly satisfy the reflectivity criteria) without even a single pair
of coherent photons being ejected from the laser but since they originated
from small internal mirror HeNe tubes, their focal lengths may have been too
short.
<p>
Anyhow, this is success!  I don't know how much more I can squeeze out of
it regardless of optics but at least the entire effort resulted in a working
laser - even if you do need to have someone point out the location of the
beam!
<p>
I have left the two-Brewster laser as well as the A-Laser (just in case)
set up against the back wall of my laser lab bench and turn it on from
time-to-time just to be sure I wasn't imagining things.  It continues to work
at about the same power (or lack thereof) level, generally without requiring
any mirror tweaking to peak it, only brushing off the Brewster windows.

<h3><A NAME="chnctbt">Comments on the Funny Two-Brewster HeNe Tube</A></h3>

I finally got around to asking Steve Roberts if he had any additional info
on this thing:
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
You've got a research tube.  And, being as short as it it, probably one
designed for a single longitudinal mode.  The foggyness on a hene is bad
news...  Do you get chaotic fluctuations as the mirror is moved slightly or if
you put your finger on the tube?  If so you have dirt in the path.
<p>
I suspect your tube was designed for spectroscopy games, or perhaps to be
locked to a iodine or methane cell as a standards laser for metrology.  Or
maybe somebody was redoing the isotope work to see if anybody missed something.
<p>
Your best bet on the isotope thing is to contact
<A HREF="http://www.spectra-gases.com/">Spectra Gases</A> and ask them what
isotopes they sell in the hot HeNe mix.

<blockquote> 
 "and a single isotope of neon (Ne<sup>20</sup>) is used to keep the gain
  bandwidth to a minimum and thereby increase the gain."
<p>
 "Using a natural mixture of neon will reduce the gain by approximately
  10%.  Additional modes will then only develop from the Ne<sup>22</sup>
  isotope if the much smaller gain in the frequency range of that isotope
  exceeds the losses within the laser cavity."
<p>
 "The shift between Ne<sup>20</sup> and Ne<sup>22</sup> is approximately 1
  GHz, whereas the bandwidth due to doppler broadening is on the order of
  1.5 GHz".
</blockquote>
<p>
From what I can tell, Ne<sup>22</sup> has a difference in gain of -9.8% in the
mix (best guess on the sign, as the graph in the text is ambiguous.  Naturally
occurring neon is: 90.8% Ne<sup>20</sup>, (10 neutrons), .26% Ne<sup>21</sup>
(11 Neutrons), and 8.9% Ne<sup>22</sup> (12 neutrons).
<p>
Naturally occurring helium is 99.9998% He<sup>4</sup> and .00013%
He<sup>3</sup>, so somebody wanted a real shift in the hyperfine spectrum of a
HeNe laser,  I would suggest asking why on the USENET newsgroup
<A HREF="news:scl.physics.research">scl.physics.research</A>.
<p>
I don't know about the chance of the other color lines lasing on a short tube
like that, but I'd get two pieces of Newport BD-1 coated mirror and find out.
It's 99.99% reflectivity across the visible spectrum and well into the IR. I
doubt you'll see green in less then a 1 meter tube with brewsters but yellow
is a strong candidate. 
<p>

<p>
I see that Spectra Gases does list He<sup>3</sup> and Ne<sup>22</sup> on their
<A HREF="http://www.spectra-gases.com/LaserGases/visinfraredgases.htm">Visible
and Infrared Laser Gases Page</A> but you have to call for more info.
<p>
As suggested, I posted to the USENET newsgroup sci.physics.research (as well
as alt.lasers).  Here is the one reply so far:
<p>
(From: Excimer (species8672@email.com).)
<p>
My good friend Chris Leubner - laser expert extraordinaire - was very
interested in your laser:

<blockquote>
 "I think you have found a very unique HeNe laser tube.  Helium 3 comes from
 tritium.  He<sup>3</sup> also has a higher energy state than normal
 He<sup>4</sup>.  So the laser is quite efficient at operating at an otherwise
 weak line.  It is most likely designed to operate at a wavelength of 1.523 um.
 This wavelength is used for infrared spectroscopy and fiber analysis.
 It most likely came from some sort of spectrometer or fiber optic
 analyzer.  Definitely hold on to this laser!  It is a very rare find!"
</blockquote>
<p>
PS: Try and see if it would work with other types of mirrors...  You
never know...
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
OK, so now I need a set of mirrors good for 1.523 um.... :)
<p>
But now, perhaps the final word:
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
Most HeNe lasers are filled with He<sup>3</sup> and an equal mixture of
Ne<sup>20</sup> and Ne<sup>22</sup>.  This broadens the gain curve and
provides a little more power.  Some want just Ne<sup>20</sup> or just
Ne<sup>22</sup>, usually for frequency references.
<p>
The center of the gain curve for Ne<sup>20</sup> and Ne<sup>22</sup> are
(can't remember for sure) about 500 MHz apart.  If you want a precise
frequency reference, you wouldn't want the mixed neon isotopes because the
center frequency could vary anywhere in that 500 MHz range.
<p>
As for the He, no one really uses He<sup>4</sup> in HeNe lasers any more - only
He<sup>3</sup>.

<h2>Sam's Instant External Mirror Laser Using a One-Brewster HeNe Tube</h2>

So even the only partially home-built HeNe laser described in the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsdiy">Sam's DIY External Mirror HeNe Laser - Some
Assembly Required!</A> is still too complex?  How about one that can be put
together in an hour or so and be made to lase with almost anything better
than a shaving mirror?  Such a laser can be built easily using a commercial
HeNe laser tube with an internal HR mirror and Brewster window in place of
the OC mirror.  While such tubes are very expensive if purchased new, they
are available surplus from various sources at reasonable prices.  In fact,
a few linearly polarized HeNe tubes (like some Hughes models) may actually be
one-Brewster tubes with the OC mirror mount fastened to the end of the tube
externally with Epoxy.  Thus, if you have one of these, it may be possible to
remove the mirror without damaging the rest of the assembly to use just the
one-Brewster tube alone.
<p>
This should be the experimenters' dream laser combining low cost, ease of use,
safety, simplicity, flexibility, and a visible beam while still providing
convenient access to the inside of the resonator.  With only very modest metal
working skills and a hacksaw, file, drill, and tap, a one-Brewster HeNe laser
tube and compatible power supply can be turned into a an external mirror (well,
one mirror at least - which is really all you probably need in most cases)
laser for experimentation with the high photon flux inside the resonator;
effects of mirror reflectivity, curvature, and location; or just the thrill
of seeing several hundred mW to several <b>WATTs</b> of HeNe laser light
bouncing off specs of dust - along with the frustration of knowing that you
can't really get at it! :)
<p>
The safety aspect in particular of this design makes it an ideal laser for
experiments requiring access to the cavity.  There are no high voltages near
the Brewster window and mirror mount assembly, the tube is fully enclosed in a
robust aluminum cylinder, and the output beam power will generally be well
below the Class IIIb threshold.  Even though there is Class IIIb power inside
the cavity, it is in a sense 'virtual' - if anything interrupts that beam,
including an unsuspecting eyeball, it simply disappears as lasing stops.
<p>
And, unlike most commercial external mirror HeNe lasers which locate the
mirrors as close to the ends of the tube as possible, you can mount the mirror
for your one-Brewster HeNe tube at almost any distance to provide either easy
access to the circulating photons or to just show off with a several hundred
or more mW beam visible in the air.  For example, with the 60 cm radius of the
HR typically found in these one-Brewster HeNe tubes, a planar mirror will work
as far away as about 30 cm (~1 foot) from the Brewster window; another 60 cm
mirror could in principle be mounted up to 90 cm (~3 feet!) away though
adjusting its alignment would be quite a treat. :)  In the design described
below, we'll be a bit less ambitious, but see the section:

Laser Tube</A>.

<h3><A NAME="chnsiobp">One-Brewster HeNe Laser Parts and Assembly</A></h3>

A drawing of a typical one-Brewster HeNe tube is shown in
<A HREF="onebrew1.gif">HeNe Laser Tube with Internal HR and Brewster Window
with External OC</A> mounted in its laser head along with the external mirror

<p>
I have a limited quantity of CLIMET 9048 laser heads (with or without power

(Not listed is any hardware required to mount the laser head and mirror mount

<p>
The left photo in <A HREF="oblaser1.jpg">Sam's External Mirror Laser Using One
Brewster HeNe Laser Head</A> shows the complete system with mirror mount and
an SP-084-1 OC mirror installed in the <A HREF="mircel1.gif">Simple Mounting
Cell for Salvaged HeNe Laser Tube Mirrors</A>.  A Melles Griot 05-LPM-379
power supply brick set for 6.5 mA provides the excitation.  The middle photo
shows the adjustable mirror mount and support standoffs.  This assembly can be
easily swapped to another similar one-Brewster HeNe head requiring at most a
touch-up of the mirror alignment.  For the right photo, an SP-084-1 HR mirror
has been installed in place of the OC to maximize the internal circulating
power.  The scatter of the 500+ mW circulating photons from the random dust
particles (in a relatively dust-free office environment) is quite visible.
<p>
Note that this HeNe tube operates reliably from a small HeNe laser power
supply like the Melles Griot 05-LPM-379 because it has a wide bore and thus a
low operating voltage (1,470 V from the power supply at 6.5 mA assuming a 68K
ballast resistance).  However, the 05-LPM-379 would appear to be a bit
marginal for starting (8 kV instead of the 10 kV listed for the tube) and
one recommendeded Melles Griot power supply is actually the 05-LPM-939 which
has a somewhat higher maximum starting (and operating) voltage.  While these
tubes will work on either supply, starting is very quick with an 05-LPM-939
even for a tube that might (on a bad day) take a minute or more to start using
an 05-LPM-379.
<p>
<A HREF="mmplts1.gif">Mirror Mount Plates for One-Brewster HeNe Laser</a>
has the mechanical details for compatibility with the CLIMET 9084.  The only
critical dimensions are the locations of the 4 corner holes and center hole.
Everything else can be modified for use with your particular mirror(s).  If
you don't have some aluminum scrap, even Plexiglas or other rigid plastic can
be used in a pinch.  The hardware should be readily available from any
electronics distributor or your junk box. :).  The fixed aluminum plate
and 4th standoff can be eliminated with a slight reduction in stability as
shown in <A HREF="onebrew5.gif">Anode-End One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube Mounted
in Test Fixture</A>.  (This also happens to be one of the less common tubes
with the Brewster window connected to the high voltage.)
<p>
If your junkbox is bare and you don't want to 'invest' in standoffs, 6-32
threaded rods or long screws and some extra nuts and washers could be
substituted instead with slightly lower rigidity and ease of set up, but the
standoffs are really much better.  In any case, don't be tempted to use too
thin a material for the mirror mount plate (not less than 1/8" for aluminum)
as the adjusting screws may warp it enough to really confuse things. :(
<A HREF="onebrew4.gif">One-Brewster HeNe Laser Head with Very Simple Mirror
Mount</A> shows such a setup with a piece of a barcode scanner spinner
mirror for the OC (though it actually is more of an HR in terms of
reflectivity).  This arrangement isn't fancy or elegant but is quite stable
and relatively easy to align.
<p>
Here is the parts list for the simplified setup:
<p>
<ul>
<li>1 - CLIMET 9048 (or equivalent) one-Brewster HeNe laser head.
<li>1 - HeNe laser power supply with Alden Connector, 1.5 kV, 6.5 mA.
<li>1 - Dielectric barcode scanner spinner mirror chip glued to 1/2" diameter
 washer.
<li>3 - 6-32 x 2" threaded machine screws.
<li>9 - 6-32 nuts.
<li>1 - Aluminum plate 2 x 2 x 1/16" (or thicker).
<li>2 - 4-40 x 1/4" screws for the mirror retainer.
</ul>
<p>
Or go a bit less basic as shown in <A HREF="wsoblh1.jpg">Enhanced Simple
Mirror Mount for One-Brewster HeNe Laser Head</A>, built by Dave
(Ws407c@aol.com) for one of these (purchased from me).  He added springs
and wing nuts which allow for easy adjustment (possibly too easy though as
bumping one will mess it up!).  Actually, the photo makes the mirror mount
look much spiffier than it does in person. :)
<p>
Almost any planar or high Radius of Curvature (RoC=r, more than about 12
inches) high reflectivity (R, more than about 94 to 96 percent at 632.8 nm)
good quality first surface mirror will result in lasing action if mounted next
to the Brewster window.  However, the range of positions beyond this for the
resonator to be stable will depend on the actual RoC as noted above.
Here are the rules:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The resonator is stable if L is less than the smaller of (60 cm,r).
<li>The resonator is stable if L is between the larger of (60 cm,r) and
 (60 cm + r).
</ul>
<p>
Where:
<ul>
<li>L = the distance from the internal HR mirror to the external mirror.
<li>r = the RoC of the external mirror.
<li>60 cm = the RoC of the internal HR mirror.
</ul>
<p>
In practice, lasing may not continue quite to the limits but should come close.
<p>
While OC mirrors from 5 or 6 inch barcode scanner HeNe tubes have adequate
reflectivity, their RoC may be so short (typically 26 cm for the OC) that no
lasing is possible until the mirror is more than 60 cm from the internal
HR (more than a foot from the Brewster window).  And, some longer
HeNe tubes like the Siemens LGR-7641S use the same 26 cm radii for the OC
mirror so tube length alone is no guarantee of a suitable OC curvature.
<p>
Some examples of the approximate range of positions (*) where an external
mirror (e.g., OC) of a particular RoC should work with the internal HR having
an RoC of 60 cm:

<PRE>
 Distance to HR: 0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100 110 120 130 140 cm

       80 cm OC: (        =\*************         ***********************
      Planar OC: (        =\*************
</PRE>

<p>
Dielectric mirrors are much better than aluminized mirrors but the latter may
work in a pinch (though not that well, and some just don't have the required
reflectivity even though they may look identical).  I've gotten several
mirrors from HeNe laser based barcode scanners and an old HeNe laser based
laser printer to work with these HeNe tubes.  A high quality dielectric mirror
with very high reflectivity (e.g., greater than 99.9 percent such as a HeNe
laser HR) and low losses should result in a great deal of circulating power
inside the resonator - possibly up to a <b>WATT</b> or more and a very visible
beam in there unless you are in a clean-room, but only a weak output beam.
The OC from a typical medium length HeNe tube will result in a more modest
300 or 400 mW inside the resonator but a useful output beam of 1.5 to 5 mW.
A mirror from that laser printer produced 750 mW inside the cavity with a
0.9 mW output.  And those barcode scanner spinner mirror chips result in very
high circulating power with only a few hundred mW of output.  As a matter of
fact, it is likely that these non-laser dielectric mirrors are actually
probably better quality than the laser-quality mirrors of the 1970s.
<p>
Even with just a bare tube or laser head without the external mirror mount,
it is quite easy to test a mirror by holding it about 2 to 3 inches away from
the Brewster window positioned so that the reflection of the light of the
discharge from the bore is centered around the Brewster mount.  Then, rocking
the mirror about this position should yield flashes quite quickly if the
mirror has adequate reflectivity and is of high enough quality.  Thus the
lasing ability of a newly acquired one-Brewster tube or head can be easily
determined without constructing the mirror mount as long as a suitable mirror
is available.  Or, evaluating a newly acquired mirror using a known good
one-Brewster tube.
<p>
These HeNe tubes usually can produce a beam which is TEM00 or multimode
depending on the mirror and a stop inserted inside the cavity.  (This should
happen on a red HeNe laser when the ratio of the aperture diameter to mode
radius is about 3.5:1.)  The higher order mode structure is quite interesting
(not just a rectangular array).  Higher quality mirrors will result in a more
well defined mode structure.  There is enough gain that additional Brewster
angle optics (even a cheap microscope slide) can be introduced inside the
resonator to act as an etalon, and possibly optics that are just AR coated
as well.
<p>
Note that there should generally be no need to touch the alignment of the
internal mirror to get these to lase unless someone before you had mucked
with it.  I don't particularly recommend attempting this alignment though
since unless the output beam is obviously non-circular (oval or cut off)
even with the external mirror aligned for maximum output power, any benefit
will be minimal.  However, where there is a locking collar present, some
careful tweaking (basically walking this mirror and your external mirror)
is relatively low risk and may result in some additional output power by
centering the intracavity beam in the bore.  Only attempt this while
the tube is lasing (unless you enjoy going through the entire alignment
procedure using an external alignment laser) and take care with the
high voltage!  Where there is no locking collar, a standard Melles Griot
locking collar from a dead HeNe laser tube can be installed.
<p>
However, with a mirror and lens for the external mirror, it can be even easier
to get these things lasing with basically no alignment.  The mirror and
lens are rather special though.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrcats">Cat's Eye Mirror for Hassle-Free Alignment</A>.
I need to scrounge something along these lines. :)

<h3><A NAME="chnsiobt">Initial Tests and Mirror Evaluation</A></h3>

The one-Brewster HeNe tube I have is part of a CLIMET 9048 laser head,
original application unknown (but likely particle counting or something like
that).  The actual HeNe tube is a Melles Griot 05-LHB-570 rated at 4 mW output
with a matched OC mirror.  (Since there are previously owned tubes, getting
that much output power may be optimistic but the ones I've tried will all do
at least 2 mW with sub-optimal mirrors, see below.)  In order to test it, I
constructed a mirror mount similar to the one described in the previous
section.  This enabled various mirrors to be easily installed and aligned and
provided access to the inside of the laser cavity.  Small mirrors could be
'quick checked' for lasing ability by positioning them inside the cavity (in
front of any mirror that is already in place) and then attached to permit
fine alignment.
<p>
First, I fired the unit up on a Melles Griot 05-LPM-379 power supply brick to
confirm that the tube was intact and had the correct discharge color.  It did,
though I figured this power supply might be a bit marginal.  From the bore
diameter of at least 1.4 mm, it would appear to be a tube which would tend to
produce a beam with multiple transverse modes and would require a higher
current than typical for narrow bore TEM00 HeNe tubes for maximum power output.
During the subsequent tests, I used an adjustable HeNe laser power supply
(the one described in the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat2">Aerotech
Model PS2B HeNe Laser Power Supply (AT-PS2B)</A> with a Variac (and its
internal regulator disabled).  A tube current of about 7.5 mA resulted in
maximum power output.  Note, however, that Melles Griot actually recommends
6.5 mA for the tube current and it turns out that the 05-LPM-379 power supply
brick will provide this with no problem.)  I don't know how life expectancy
will be affected by runnnig at the higher current and the ballast resistor
supplied with the CLIMET 9048 laser head may overheat after awhile.
<p>
The OC-end of the laser head has a flange with conveniently located holes to
attach the external optics.  I used 4, 2-1/4" x 1/4 threaded spacers to mount
a pair of 2"x2"x1/8" plates, the second of which is adjustable via using a
hex wrench via cap-head screws and split washers used as springs.  My mirror
mount. :)  See the <A HREF="onebrew1.gif">HeNe Laser Tube with Internal HR
and Single Brewster Window and External OC</A>.
<p>
Based on the geometry (assuming that the HR mirror has a radius of curvature
of 60 cm as I had been told and later verified), a stable resonator should
result for an external mirror at a 30 cm distance from the HR as long as its
radius is between +30 cm and planar (concave) or -30 cm and planar (convex).
This means that except for some short radius barcode scanner HeNe tube
mirrors, almost anything else with enough reflectivity at 632.8 nm should
work.  At this point, I didn't really know the value of the required
reflectivity to achieve threshold.
<p>
I had several possible mirrors to try both from deceased internal mirror HeNe
tubes as well as from a couple of external mirror HeNe lasers.  Initially, for
rough alignment, I used another HeNe laser (the A-Laser) firing down the bore
of the 9048 without the OC in place.  The returned a strong nicely focused
reflection which (indicating a curved/concave OC) and centered in the A-Laser's
output aperture.  Then, without disturbing anything, the candidate OC-mirror
was installed and the mirror mount adjusted to center its reflection in the
A-Laser's output aperture.
<p>
I first tried the OC from a dismembered tiny barcode scanner HeNe tube - a
Melles Griot 05-LHR-002-246.  No amount of fiddling resulted in any output
beam.  Nor did the use of its companion HR.  (Using an HR mirror in place of
the normal OC to test a laser results in the lowest lasing threshold since it
maximizes round trip gain.  Thus, it should be easiest to get going where
losses are unknown.  For a high power laser, this can be risky since the
oscillations in the resonator could build up to a sufficient level to
actually damage the optics.  However, for a low power (at least) HeNe laser,
such effects are unlikely.)  I assume that these mirrors were unsuitable
either because the reflectance was too low (for the OC) and/or they were
curved with a radius of curvature that was too small (almost certainly the
latter).  (Later I did achieve lasing with that same HR.  I don't really know
what caused it to fail the first time.)
<p>
Next, I tried the HR mirror from an unidentified (but probably Hughes)
internal mirror HeNe tube, using the same alignment technique.  And, almost
as soon as I touched the adjustment screws to center the its reflection, a
beam appeared!  I almost missed it shining back into the A-Laser but then
noticed the really bright scatter off of the Brewster window.  With the a bit
of tweaking and HR mirror adjusted for maximum output, the beam was weak
(maybe 10 &micro;W, just the minimal transmission through the HR that is normally
considered waste!) but this was success!  While not exactly strong, it was
stable.  Of course between the OC and the Brewster window, there was probably
several hundred mW bouncing back and forth as evidenced by the dancing
illuminated specs of dust. :)
<p>
As expected, the laser produced a beam with multiple transverse modes - perhaps
TEM44 though somewhat jumbled (not a nice rectangular or hexagonal array).
<p>
Well, a 10 &micro;W beam isn't anything to write home about (unless it is the first
one you ever got from a semi-home-built laser of this type!), so as much as I
didn't want to disassemble a working setup, I decided to try the one remaining
good mirror from the small external mirror HeNe lab laser described in the
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henish4">A Really Old HeNe Laser</A> (the other
mirror was damaged due to a cleaning attempt since they were soft-coated as I
found out the hard way).  I really didn't know whether it was the OC or HR.
<p>
With the wide bore of the 9048's tube, I discovered that if a mirror candidate
was going to work, I could pretty much dispense with the rough alignment.
Just holding the OC in my hand next to the mirror plate and rocking it would
result in flashes!  And, for this mirror, the beam was definitely much
stronger than the previous attempt so I assume it was the OC of the lab
laser.  When mounted as shown in the diagram, the result was a TEM77 (or
thereabouts - again not like would be shown in a textbook!) beam of about
1 mW output power.
<p>
Next, I tried the OC from a large frame Spectra-Physics HeNe laser,
possibly an SP-125 (I don't really know for sure where it came from).  This
proved to be the best so far.  A similar or perhaps even more complex and
wonderful mode structure but with over 2 mW of output power.
<p>
The acquisition of this head represented a pleasant interlude to my otherwise
frustrating experience (so far at least) with the funny two-Brewster tube I
had been attempting to get to lase.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsdiy">Sam's DIY External Mirror HeNe Laser - Some
Assembly Required!</A>.  Knowing that the CLIMET 9048 had been a
commercial product and thus known to work in some application gave me
confidence that only minimal fiddling would be needed to get it to produce
a beam.  And, as it turned out, it was even easier than I had expected.
<p>
Watching the beam between the OC and Brewster window is entertaining in
itself knowing that more than 350 mW is circulating there but not being able
to tap it!  (2.25 mW out for a mirror with 99.4% reflectivity.)  The amount of
power is evident from the visibility of light scattered from the specs of dust
as noted above.  Of course, moving anything (including a finger - since the
power can't be extracted, you won't feel anything - trust me!) in to block
any portion of the circulating beam results in a reduction in the output power
and the number of transverse modes present (reducing the diameter of the beam).
<p>
As an experiment, I introduced a microscope slide as a second Brewster window
between the OC and the tube's Brewster window.  This also resulted in a
significant reduction in output power and the number of transverse modes but
not to the point of killing lasing entirely (at least as long as the slide was
immaculate and arranged close to the optimal angle).  (When doing this, some
very slight mirror adjustment will be needed if the OC is curved since the
refraction inside the second Brewster shifts the location of the beam
slightly).
<p>
I later dug up an etalon from a large frame ion laser and tried that - I could
get reasonably strong lasing when held very carefully with its optical axis
nearly parallel to the tube's axis.  I don't currently have a suitable mount
for the etalon so further experiments with this will have to wait.
<p>
And, even a single spec of dust may reduce power by 10 percent or more.  Just
sitting in my not-so-sterile basement lab resulted in a steady decrease in
power over the course of a few minutes (after cleaning) as dust collected on
the optics.  In fact, I suspect that a proper cleaning of both the Brewster
window and OC with spectroscopic grade methanol in a dust free environment
would result in substantially more output power.  I was just using using 90%
isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs!  (With enough work, the scatter off of
the outer surface can be made less intense than the scatter from the
supposedly pristine inner surface (inside the tube) of the Brewster window.)
I have not done <i>any</i> cleaning of the OCs themselves beyond blowing off
dust with an air-bulb since I don't have the proper cleaning supplies and
they are a lot less robust than the Brewster window.
<p>
I then positioned the OC from a poor old deceased Spectra-Physics 084-1 HeNe
laser tube (it didn't survive baking in the microwave oven! :)  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt6">An Older HeNe Laser Tube</A>) in my
hand between the Brewster window and OC mounting plate to see if it would work
- and got flashes immediately.  So I installed it.  With full alignment and
optimization requiring somewhat less than 1 minute, I'm getting spoiled by the
eagerness of this setup to lase!  This mirror performed at least as well as
the large-frame OC peaking at more than 3.0 mW with a well dusted Brewster
window:

<ul>
<li>Output beam power after 10 minute warmup with clean optics: 3.2 mW.
<li>Power lost from Brewster window reflections: .06 mW x 2 (up and down)
 = .12 mW.
<li>Circulating power: 300+ mW (based on known OC mirror reflectivity of 1%).
</ul>

The OC from a deceased 20 mW internal mirror HeNe tube produced an output beam
of about the same power level despite its reflectivity being only 97.7 percent.
<p>
As noted, testing and aligning these mirrors is very easy with this wide bore
HeNe tube.  The 'holding the mirror in your hand and rocking it trick' doesn't
work nearly as well with a narrow bore 05-LHB-270 one-Brewster HeNe tube.
That tube has a bore that is less than 1 mm and produces a TEM00 beam using
the same SP-084-1 OC but mirror alignment is definitely more challenging!

<h3><A NAME="chnslunm">Lasing Using Non-Laser Mirrors</A></h3>

A few weeks later, on a hunch, I decided to try a couple of other mirrors that
were never intended to be used inside a laser resonator.  Someone had sent me
several cartons of supermarket checkout barcode scanners and parts (most HeNe
laser based) which naturally include many mirrors, all first surface.  Some
dielectric coated but most are just aluminized.  I couldn't resist trying a
couple of the smaller mirrors from an IBM 4687 just to see what would happen
using the "hold the mirror approximately in front of the HeNe tube" approach.
:)  The IBM 4687 is the full size (often with electronic scale) scanner used
at many supermarkets (at least until they are replaced with something more
modern).

<ul>
<li><b>Dielectric mirror:</b> - This is used in the beam return path and is
 thus quite large compared to what is needed here - approximately 1.5" x 2" -
 so you could get <b>many</b> laser mirrors from one of these with the use of
 a glass cutter!  It is dielectric coated for the 632.8 nm wavelength and
 appears to be of very high quality.  First, I tested it to determine
 approximate reflectivity using another HeNe laser.  Result: At least 99.3
 percent.  After removing that wonderful SP-084-1 OC and setting it aside, it
 took all of 5 seconds, to obtain a nice beam and dancing dust particles inside
 the resonator.  Its intensity appeared to be stronger than that using the OC
 from the large-frame HeNe laser or SP084 tube - possibly as much as 1 W by
 eyeball.  The output beam was somewhat weak - perhaps .2 mW.  At some point,
 I will determine these more precisely.  So, this mirror would make a nice HR
 for experiments requiring a high photon flux inside the resonator.
<p>
<li><b>Aluminized mirror:</b> - This is the 'first turn mirror' - used to
 fold the beam path from the scanner's HeNe laser.  Being aluminized, it
 really has no business working as a resonator mirror at all in a low gain
 HeNe laser - but it did, with almost the same ease.  However, the performance
 was not nearly as good as with the dielectric mirrors.  The internal
 circulating power might have peaked at (just guessing) 10 or 20 mW (compared
 to the several hundred mW for the SP084 and possibly much more for the 4687
 dielectric mirror, above.  (Of course, with the aluminized coating, there was
 no output beam at all.)  Just the fact that it worked testifies to eagerness
 with which this tube likes to lase!
</ul>

Both these mirrors are, of course, planar.  They are also quite old but in
pristine condition.  I just used some rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol for cleaning.
<p>
I then tried a dielectric mirror ripped from a little somewhat bedraggled
multifaceted motorized scanner, origin and purpose unknown.  I mounted this
one properly so I could actually tweak the alignment and expect it to stay
put.  It also had very high reflectivity, similar to the dielectric barcode
scanner mirror:

<ul>
<li>Output beam power after 10 minute warmup with not particularly clean
 optics: .5 mW.
<li>Power lost from Brewster window reflections: .1 mW x 2 (up and down)
 = .2 mW.
<li>Circulating power: 500+ mW (based on Brewster reflection power relative
 to SP084-1 OC, above).
</ul>

In fact, this mirror would work even when mounted with its <i>back</i> (glass)
side facing the HeNe tube!  Not as well - output of about .15 mW but that it
did anything is still kind of amazing!
<p>
Next, I installed the dielectric turning mirror from an old large HeNe
laser-based laser printer, manufacturer and model unknown:

<ul>
<li>Output beam power after 10 minute warmup with relatively clean optics:
 .9 mW.
<li>Power lost from Brewster window reflections: .15 mW x 2 (up and down)
 = .3 mW.
<li>Circulating power: 750+ mW (based on Brewster reflection power relative
 to SP084-1 OC, above).
</ul>

This printer yielded a number of mirrors that with adequate reflectivity but
some of the others had a frosted back surface so they wouldn't make very good
OCs but would be fine for HRs and inside-the-cavity experiments.
<p>
Some time later, I acquired a cosmetic reject HR mirror for a 1,000 W (!!)
copper vapor laser made by Coherent for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
(sent to me courtesy of <A HREF="http://www.sro-optics.com/">Sterling Resale
Optics</A>).  This mirror was just a bit of overkill in the diameter
department: 76 mm (3 inches)!  It must have cost the U.S. Government more than
you would care to imagine. :)  While designed for the wavelength range 511 to
578 nm at 45 degree incidence (better than 99.996 percent, 1/20 wave surface
finish), since the reflectivity wavelength function shifts up about 50 nm when
going to 0 degree incidence, I expected it to work well at 632.8 nm - and the
results were most impressive.  Although it was somewhat difficult to tell by
just holding the mirror in my hand (heck, I don't have a mount for a 3 inch
diameter mirror!), the circulating power appeared to be higher than anything
tested previously with only a small fraction of a mW of output.  I was unable
to measure its reflectivity.  My 2 mW HeNe laser's beam could barely be
detected visually (on a piece of paper) after passing though the mirror and
didn't register on my laser power meter.  It's reflectivity is certainly
better than 99.95 percent.
<p>
I then remembered that I had a nice new Nd:YAG 45 degree HR mirror someone
else had sent me and tried this, also with great success.  Its reflectivity is
about 99.4 percent for 632.8 nm at 0 degree incidence - more appropriate for an
OC, and produced 1 to 2 mW of output power (not measured).
<p>
Later, I did build a universal mount of sorts for the mongo mirror so I could
stabilize the beam.  I didn't measure either the intra-cavity or output power
but they were as high and as low, respectively, as I've seen with this one
Brewster head.  The beam, all 10 or 20 &micro;W of it, was multimode as expected,
but a sort of doughnut in this case.
<p>
Perhaps, I will have to try a shaving mirror next. :)  However, this probably
won't work.  Some other first surface aluminized mirrors (from an Orion 300
barcode scanner) were just on the hairy edge of the lasing threshold resulting
in a very weak beam even when optimally aligned.  In all fairness to the
physics, an HeNe tube of this size would have a single pass gain of about
2 to 3 percent and thus a round trip gain of about 4 to 6 percent (based on my
measurements of the single pass gain of a two-Brewster HeNe tube of slightly
shorter length.  See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioispg">The Single Pass Gain Test</A>).  With a high
quality HR and Brewster window (to be expected on a tube of this type), those
would result in minimal losses so nearly the entire 4 to 6 percent would be
available to squander on the external mirror!

<h3><A NAME="chndem1b">Demonstration One-Brewster HeNe Laser</A></h3>

I acquired a 3 mW HeNe laser that was built into a wonderful Plexiglas box
with an output fiber-coupler.  This was the aiming laser for some sort of
big dye or YAG laser.  Since 3 mW HeNe lasers are somewhat boring, even with
exposed innards, I decided to replace the tube with one of the bare
05-LHB-570s and the fiber-coupler with an adjustable OC mirror.  The result
is shown in <A HREF="demolas2.jpg">Demonstration One-Brewster HeNe Laser</A>.
The adjustable OC mirror mount is just the platter stack hold-down plate from
a defunct harddrive seated on an O-ring with 4 screws.  The OC mirror itself,
installed in one of my standard mirror cells, is from an SP-084 HeNe laser
tube.  (I saved the fiber-coupler and fiber for future use - it has the
standard hole pattern for mounting on most Melles Griot cylindrical laser
heads.)  Although not perfectly sealed, the Plexiglas cover provides enough
protection so the Brewster window doesn't seem to require cleaning even
after months of sitting on a shelf in my dusty basement, err, laser lab. :)

<h3><A NAME="chngrnob">A Green One-Brewster HeNe Laser</A></h3>

A few months after constructing my one-Brewster HeNe tube test fixture
(see the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnslttf">HeNe Laser Tube Test
Fixture</A>), I was given an 05-LGB-580, a tube identical to the very high
quality 05-LHB-580 but with an HR mirror optimized for green (543.5 nm).
Popping this tube into the test fixture along with a matching green external
HR mirror, it took only about 5 minutes and there were piles of green photons
bouncing back and forth between the mirrors!  However, having previously
gotten a HeNe tube with an obliterated mirror coating to lase (see the
section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnwtl">External Mirror Laser Using HeNe
Tube with Missing Mirror Coating</A>), I figured I could even make
a carrot lase, so this green tube really wasn't much of a challenge at all!
<p>
The setup is shown in <A HREF="onebrew3.gif">Hughes Style One-Brewster HeNe
Laser Tube Mounted in Test Fixture</A>.
<p>
To align the mirror, I first set the mirror adjustment screws so the mount
was just snug.  Then, while gradually tightening the Y adjustment screw, I
rocked the mount in X by (pressing and releasing the plate near the X
adjustment screw) until there were flashes of green light reflecting off the
Brewster window, and then tightened the X adjustment screw to obtain a stable
beam.  Fine tuning of X and Y peaked circulating power by maximizing the size
of the beam scatter on the Brewster window's surface (and thus the number of
transverse modes).
<p>
Note that since this tube has a glass Brewster stem (the part that holds the
Brewster window), it isn't possible (or at least easy) to view the reflection
of the bore light back from the mirror (the glow from inside the tube is too
bright.)  One option is to put a shroud over all but the central area to
block this light.  However, an alternative way to align the mirror is to
view the reflection of the bore light from the mirror off of the Brewster
window (from the direction shown in the diagram for "Reflections from Brewster
Window").  When this lines up with the reflection of the center of the mirror
itself, alignment should be close enough for lasing - you will see flashes.
Then, fine tune.  CAUTION: For a low power laser like this, viewing the
reflection is safe even if it is lasing at full power as what comes off the
Brewster window is much less than a mW.  However, don't even think about
looking at any such reflection for higher power lasers!
<p>
Since both mirrors are very high quality HRs, not much comes out the ends
(perhaps a &micro;W or so) but the 4 reflections off the Brewster must total 0.1 mW.
This thing came right up with difficulty (or lack thereof) of alignment and
mode structure similar to the red one-Brewster tubes but lases green!  There
is probably several hundre mW, perhaps more than a 1 watt of circulating power
based on the brightness of the green photons bouncing back and forth in there.
It's nice and stable except that dust just loves to collect on the Brewster
windows.  Now, what can I do with high green photon flux?
<p>
I tried inserting a microscope slide at the Brewster angle as well as nearly
perpendicular but all variations killed lasing entirely - not surprising given
the gain (or lack thereof) for the green line.  And, as confirmation of how
low the gain really is, while I can leave a red one-Brewster laser out for
a week and have it come right up with nearly full power (at least by eyeball),
I usually have to dust off the the Brewster window on this green one to get
anything after only a few minutes (or less depending on conditions in my
'lab').  But then I'm still amazed that such a short tube can do green at
all! :)
<p>
I wonder what the reflectance of a OC would need to be for optimum output
(rather than maximum intra-cavity flux)?  I've obtained the mirrors from a
physically broken 05-LGP-170, a large green internal mirror HeNe tube.
(Don't ask but not mine, courtesy of "Dr. Destroyer of Lasers"!)  These
should make for some interesting experiments. :)  The OC probably won't be
optimal, having originated from a 16 inch long tube.  But since the 05-LGP-170
was a polarized tube, it did have a Brewster plate inside so that at least
will be similar in terms of losses.  Hopefully, the OC will still have a
high enough reflectivity to lase.  If it does, almost <i>any</i> output beam
would be stronger than what I have now!
<p>
But, so far, it doesn't look too promising.  I can barely get flashes from the
salvaged HR and only with a super clean Brewster window - after 30 seconds to
a minute of just sitting, enough dust (or something) collects on its surface
to kill lasing totally.  And, I can't get anything from the OC.  Now, I
haven't yet mounted them solidly - I'm just holding the mirrors (in their
mounts) in my hand so this hasn't been exactly what you'd call a highly
controlled experiment.  However, with the high gain (relatively speaking) red
one-Brewster tubes, it would be more than adequate to test out a candidate
mirror.  And, I was able to evaluate the matching green HR that came with
the one-Brewster tube without difficulty in this manner.  So, it must be a
super high quality high reflector even compared to what goes inside green
internal mirror HeNe tubes.  Assuming a circulating power of over 100 mW and
an output of 1 &micro;W, its reflectivity must be greater than 99.999%!  Since the
gain for green is only a small fraction of the gain for red - much less than
1/10th its value, the reflectivity of the mirrors is super critical, even
more so with the not absolutely sterile Brewster window inside the cavity.
That last decimal point of reflectivity is significant as there just isn't
much headroom and even a very small difference between the two HR mirrors
can determine whether any lasing occurs at all.
<p>
There is a very slight possibility that the salvaged 05-LGP-170 mirrors are
damaged (say from running with reverse polarity) or defective ("Oops, Joe,
you know that batch of dud green tubes, we installed the wrong mirrors!") as
they did come from a tube that didn't lase and may have been a manufacturing
reject to begin with.  I could understand the OC not having high enough
reflectivity since it was supposed to be for a much longer bore tube but I'm
rather surprised that the HR is causing problems.  The next step - to mount
the HR and see if I can get sustained lasing without an automatic Brewster
window wiper - is thus far proving to be very frustrating and so far my 'by
hand' approach isn't working - there is no way to know if the Brewster window
is clean enough for lasing without the mirrors being aligned and lasing.  So,
lack of flashes could be bad alignment or a dirty window - a "catch-22"
situation.
<p>
Even after setting up a red HeNe alignment laser, I have been unable to get
the 05-LGP-170 HR (or even my super LLNL mirror) to do anything.  With this
rig, I can pop in the matching HR and get green flashes consistently but not
at all for the other mirrors.  In fact, I can't get any flashes from the
05-LGP-170 HR at all at this point - clean Brewster or not.  Apparently, the
mirror must have collected a film of crud or dust or something just sitting
around and in a bag or from when it was out for testing.  It certainly looks
pristine but won't cooperate! :)
<p>
I have subsequently tested the 05-LGP-170 mirrors for reflectivity of the
green and yellow HeNe lines (using working HeNe lasers to provide the probe
beams).  For green, they appear to be quite good, at least to the extent
that they reflect the green wavelength.  Both reflect virtually 100 percent
of green light - passing too little green to register on my laser power meter.
For the HR, it is just barely possible to detect photons leaking out by eye.
But I guess this is still inferior to the HR mirror which works with the green
one-Brewster tube.  However, the salvaged HR passes the yellow wavelength
almost as though the mirror isn't there (less than 25 percent reflectivity)
while the OC's reflectivity for yellow is about 98 percent.  Either is low
enough to kill the lasing on the yellow (and any other visible) HeNe lines
entirely - which is surely the intent.  Unfortunately, the HR inside the
one-Brewster tube also reflects less than 99% of yellow so there will be no
hope of getting it to lase yellow or any other non-green colors.

<h3><A NAME="chnstune">Sam's Tunable HeNe Laser (Hopefully)</A></h3>

This is another works-in-progress since I haven't actually detected anything
but 632.8 nm red - yet.  Encouraged by confirmation that at least some
versions of the Melles Griot 05-LHB-570 One-Brewster HeNe tube incorporate an
HR mirror that has a reflectivity of better than 99.9 percent from 590 to 680
nm, I salvaged the wavelength tuning assembly - a Brewster prism and mirror
mount - from my discombobulated Carson laser (see the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argold0">The Really Strange Carson Dual Tube Ion
Laser</A>.  Normally, this is used at the HR-end of the laser but I don't
have that option with a One-Brewster HeNe tube so it will be at the OC-end
instead (though I will using mirrors with high reflectivity for initial tests
at least).  One disadvantage of this arrangement, however, is that any output
beam will exit at a steep angle (around 50 degrees) and this will change
slightly as the tuning prism assembly is adjusted to select wavelength.
<p>
I constructed a bracket using my standard 1 inch hole spacing so it could be
attached to the optics mount of any of my One-Brewster HeNe lasers.  The
existing mirror mount allows for movement side-to-side (yaw or X) using its
X adjustment screw while the Brewster prism assembly can be moved up-and-down
(pitch or Y) on its pivots or by using the Y mirror adjustment screw.
<p>
So far, this contraption lases happily at the usual (now quite boring) 632.8 nm
red wavelength using both one of my barcode scanner mirror 'chips' and the
HR mirror from a Spectra-Physics 084-1 HeNe tube.  The first of these isn't
the greatest quality and the spectral reflectivity curve of the 084-1 HR isn't
known.  I hope to dig up a proper broadband HR, perhaps from a diseased
Hughes style One-Brewster HeNe tubes.
<p>
Unfortunately, the losses from passing through 3 optical surfaces (the
tube's Brewster window and the two sides of the Brewster prism) take their
toll and cleanliness becomes even more important than before.  And, the
surfaces collect a noticeable power reducing coating in my not so pristine
lab (or lack thereof) conditions quite quickly.  However, it still seems to
produce a circulating and output power which are at least of the same order
of magnitude as without the tuning prism. :)
<p>
With the Brewster prism itself mounted about 6 inches from the
Brewster window, adjusting its vertical angle (pitch) causes the mode
structure to change as the mode volume shifts position in an attempt to
continue lasing.  This may be part of the difficulty in getting other
wavelengths to lase - the dominant 632.8 nm line is sucking all the power
even when the mirror/prism assembly isn't well aligned with the bore and
internal HR mirror.  It may also be the due to reflectivity characteristics
of the external mirror I'm using in conjunction with cruddy optical surfaces.
<p>
I then moved the wavelength tuning assembly to the laser described in the
section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsmotj">Mirror/Optics Test Jig Using
One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube</A> since it could be mounted more than 18
inches from the tube's Brewster window which should restrict the mode
options.  Even with a pair of .040" diameter stops in the internal beam path
(one at the Brewster window and the other just before the wavelength tuning
assembly) - which makes alignment much more of a pain - I still cannot obtain
any confirmed sightings of non-632.8 nm wavelengths.
<p>
Part of the problem is that I don't know if I'd really recognize something
that was just another shade of red like 640.1 nm and certainly not 629.4 or
635.2 nm as different colors so I would really have to use a spectroscope
to be sure - which I don't have.  A simple diffraction grating won't work
(at least not easily) since adjusting the tuning prism also moves the beam
(that gets through the HR mirror) with this arrangement.  This would confuse
any measurements of angle or position.  Only if I were to have two wavelengths
lasing simultaneously would I see it with a diffraction grating - and that
hasn't happened as far as I can tell.  Orange at 611.9 nm would be easily seen
as a different color but the gain of that line is quite low - about 1/7th of
632.8 nm and 1/3rd of 640.1 nm.  That one has the highest gain of any visible
line except 632.8 nm and is thus my best hope.
<p>
One option would be to attempt to use a diffraction grating on the reflection
off the tube's Brewster window but even that will move around somewhat as the
mode structure changes.
<p>
So, I still have the following unknowns:
<p>
<ul>
<li>One-Brewster HeNe tube HR spectral reflectivity curve - I am still not sure
 that this mirror has the needed broadband response.  The data I have are for
 newer versions of the 05-LHB-570 and may not apply to the tube in my surplus
 head.  A quick test with a yellow (594.1 nm) HeNe laser indicates a high
 reflectivity at 594.1 nm - perhaps 99.9% - but that could be off by an
 order of magnitude.  So an inadequate internal HR is still a possibility.
 And, of course, there is absolutely no chance of green (543.5 nm) lasing
 since the HR reflectivity at 543.5 nm will be way down and green gain may be
 even lower than that of yellow.
<p>
<li>External mirror spectral reflectivity curve - The SP084-1 HR mirror I am
 using may be designed to kill non-632.8 nm wavelengths.  I have now tested
 the SP084-1 mirrors using that yellow probe beam: The HR and OC are 99% and
 98.5% reflective at 594.1 nm, respectively.  The HR's 99 percent is much too
 low to permit yellow lasing.  I haven't tested the orange (611.9 nm) and
 other red (640.1 nm) wavelengths but suspect that the reflectivity for
 orange will also be inadequate though 640.1 nm may have a chance.  In any
 case, I need to find myself a decent broadband HR.
<p>
<li>Wavelength tuning assembly selectivity - This includes the dispersion of
 the prism in conjunction with the mode volume of the HeNe tube and mode
 structure accommodation that is taking place.  I don't have the option (at
 least not easily) with the one-Brewster tube of also tweaking its HR mirror
 alignment in an attempt to suppress the unwanted 632.8 nm wavelength as
 would be possible with a two-Brewster tube.
<p>
<li>Overall system losses - The three uncoated external surfaces (the tube's
 Brewster window and the two sides of the Brewster prism), external mirror
 and inside of Brewster window.  Contributing factors include not quite
 perfect Brewster angle, dust, and gunk on the optics.
<p>
<li>Use of Mark-I eyeballs as wavelength measuring instrument. :)  This would
 only apply to other red lines.  629.4 is not likely present.  But, 640.1 nm
 may have high enough gain to lase and be close enough to 632.8 nm that I'd
 miss it.  I'd certainly detect orange or yellow.
</ul>
<p>
Well, I have yet to see a single photon of non-632.8 nm coherent light (though
I guess I wouldn't recognize 629.4 nm), even using my LLNL 99.996 percent
broadband HR mirror, two one-Brewster tubes in tandem, as well as using the HR
from another high quality one-Brewster tube (all without the tuning prism).  If
anything should produce other color photons, it would be the tandem arrangement
since that should be about equivalent to a single one-Brewster tube with an
ideal (perfect broadband reflector) external HR mirror.  I though I'd at least
see 640 nm since that should be a strong line.  With the Brewster prism tuner,
I get a decently strong red beam, but nothing else even with a stop in the beam
to restrict the modes and the tuner located a foot and a half away from the
B-window to give it more sensitivity.  I can see the reflection of the bore
light of the tube come back and hit the stop and its color changes nicely
without affecting alignment as the tuner is adjusted, just no lasing except
at 632.8 nm.
<p>
I wonder if the older 1-B tubes had significantly crappier mirrors or the
gain of that relatively short (10") tube is just too low.  I did try to
determine the reflectivity of the 1-B tube's HR at 594.1 nm from a yellow
HeNe laser but the results were inconclusive - high enough to possibly be
satisfactory but not nearly perfect.  There are also a bunch of other
variables which I may not have gotten all just right yet.
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
<blockquote>
"On the multiline experiment, any idea on the order of magnitude losses on
 your optics?  I.e., scatter and absorption?  Not that the actual number is
 that important, but it can kill you in a hurry when you're looking for
 non-red light. Make sure that puppy is ultra clean, too. I'd tend toward
 lasing massively multimode red (make it scream), then bounce the output beam
 off of a grating.  The other lines should be in there - you almost can't
 escape getting 640 nm, and 612 nm isn't that tough.    
<p>
 I've also got multiline lasing by stacking two HRs together (one behind the
 other).  Actually, get it lasing with one HR, then put the second behind it
 and tweak appropriately.  It's not stable by any means, but you can get it
 to lase.  Finally, when you are tuning (I assume tilting) the prism, are you
 sure you're not walking-off, out of alignment as you tune?  Bottom line, try
 to get multiline lasing first, worry about tuning to a single line later.  A
 wavelength tunable HeNe is a bitch!   
<p>
 Anyway, the older B-tubes definitely had crappier mirrors."
</blockquote>
<p>
From data acquired from my multiline HeNe laser experiments (see the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hengowi">Getting Other Wavelengths from Internal Mirror
HeNe Laser Tubes</A>), I now believe that the SP084-1 mirrors are quite
selective for the 632.8 nm line and their reflectivity drops off enough
to suppress other wavelengths.  I also know that even a Climet 1-B tube
with a Hughes 1-B HR or another Climet 1-B tube in tandem will not produce
a single non-633 nm coherent photon.  If none of these configurations result
in even unstable lasing at other wavelengths, there will be little hope
of doing so with the tuning prism assembly.
<p>
More to follow.

<h3><A NAME="chnobhlr">One-Brewster HeNe Laser Resonator
 Considerations</A></h3>

Here are some guidelines for construction of a resonator and for
experimentation with the Melles Griot 05-LHB-570 one-Brewster HeNe laser
tube like the type inside the CLIMET 9048 laser head.  Other models may
differ somewhat but this should be a good starting point.

<ul>
<li><b>Minimum mirror reflectivity:</b> The round trip gain of this HeNe tube
 is between 4 and 6 percent).  Therefore, R must be greater than 96 to 94
 percent respectively, for any lasing to occur.  As noted in the previous
 sections, there are a wide variety of readily available mirrors that meet
 this requirement.
<p>
<li><b>Mirror reflectivity for maximum output power:</b> This will be in the
 range where R is 98 to 99.5 percent.  I don't know exactly where the peak is
 but R = 99% works quite well.
<p>
<li><b>Mirror reflectivity for maximum intra-cavity power:</b> Obviously, this
 will be where R is as close to 100% as possible.  However, above about 99.99
 percent, it probably doesn't make that much difference and mirror quality and
 Brewster window cleanliness dominate.
<p>
<li><b>Acceptable mirror types:</b> High quality dielectric mirrors
 with the desired reflectivity at 632.8 nm are by far the best.  However,
 some metal coated mirrors will also work - barely.  I have confirmed this
 with what appear to be either protected aluminum or enhanced aluminum
 mirrors from barcode scanners but no other types.  I rather suspect the
 latter because the peak reflectance would be around 95 percent, compared
 to 90 percent for typical protected aluminum.  This based on a chart from
 Melles Griot.  (There will, of course, be no output beam with any of these
 since aluminum is quite opaque.)  However, aluminum mirrors are not all
 created equal and many won't work at all due to low reflectivity or poor
 quality or both.
<p>
<li><b>Mirror radius of curvature:</b> The radius of curvature (r) of the
 HR mirror in the Melles Griot 05-LHB-570 HeNe tube inside the CLIMET 9048
 laser head is 60 cm.  Based on the g1*g2 parameters (see the section:
 <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioigef1">Resonator Stability</A>) and experiments,
 a planar mirror will work almost up to L = 60 cm and a mirror with r = 60 cm
 (concave) will work almost up to L = 120 cm.  I leave it as an exercise for
 the reader to determine the usable range for a convex mirror. :)
<p>
<li><b>Transverse mode structure:</b>  This HeNe tube will operate multimode
 unless forced to do otherwise (with a stop inside the cavity).  The actual
 mode structure will depend on a variety of factors, the most important being
 the radius of curvature (r) of the external mirror and the distance between
 mirrors (L).  Shorter radii result in more complex mode patterns and in
 general, none of them look much like what you will find in a laser text!
 You can use a short focal length positive lens to expand the beam to view the
 mode pattern on a screen.
<p>
<li><b>Wavelengths:</b> So far, I've only been able to obtain lasing at 632.8
 nm, the common 'red' HeNe color.  I suspect that 640.2 nm should also be
 possible since this may have 1/2 the gain of the 632.8 nm line and the HR
 mirror should still have decent reflectivity but it may take the combination
 of a line selecting prism and a special OC mirror which suppresses the 632.8
 nm line.  I have no idea about other colors but suspect the HR mirror isn't
 broadband enough.  Too bad. :(
<p>
<li><b>Resonator construction:</b> With its wide bore, resonator rigidity
 and precision isn't as critical as with a similar length TEM00 laser.  To
 get something built quickly, a thick base made of high quality laminated
 hardwood will even suffice.  This can be reinforced with a couple of metal
 strips like those used to hang shelving.

<h2>Other Things to Build with One-Brewster Laser Tubes or Heads</h2>
<h3><A NAME="chnsobtt">One-Brewster HeNe Laser Heads in Tandem</A></h3>

For my next strange experiment, I decided to attach a pair of these one
Brewster HeNe laser heads together - Brewster windows to Brewster window to
see how high the circulating power could go.  As long as the radium of
curvature of the internal HR is greater than the distance between the two HRs,
the resonator should be stable.  A way to confirm this is to try a flat mirror
as the external OC/HR.  If the tube lases and can be aligned to a stable
peak output power, the HR radius should be at least double the distance to
the that flat mirror.  Although there will be double the losses through the
pair of Brewster windows, the gain will be more than double that of a single
tube.  The net effect should be nearly equivalent to a one-Brewster HeNe tube
of twice the length with an optimum (super reflectivity) external HR.
<p>
With only one HeNe tube powered, the round trip gain is about 4 to 6 percent
and with the additional Brewster loss, the beam won't be quite as strong as
with just an external HR mirror.  However, with both tubes powered, there will
be a total 8 to 12 percent gain.  This will result in a stronger photon
flux inside the resonator and also provide enough gain margin to allow a
variety of optics like etalons to be inserted into the cavity.
<p>
I attached the two tubes using 3 inch threaded standoffs with lockwashers
between these and the flange of one of the tubes - a sort of oversize mirror
mount where one of the tubes in its entirety is the mirror!  The orientation
is with the Brewster windows both facing the same way so hopefully, any offset
of the bore will cancel.  Lateral alignment is a challenge but with the large
(1.4 mm) bore, it should be close enough to lase initially.  Then, tweaking
can be done once the basic alignment has been achieved.  The configuration
looked similar to <A HREF="dobtlas1.gif">High Photon Flux Laser Using a Pair
of One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tubes in Tandem</A> though perhaps not quite as
polished.  At least, that is what I thought originally.
<p>
However, this scheme will only work if the Brewster windows on the two tubes
are oriented exactly the same way.  On these laser heads, this is not always
the case since it didn't matter for the original particle counting application.
Thus an adapter would need to be added between them to allow for their
relative angle to be adjusted precisely.  Otherwise, the planes of
polarization won't line up and there will be additional losses.
<p>
What I didn't realize initially was that the Brewster window alignment
on my pair of one-Brewster heads was off by 15 or 20 degrees using the
existing bolt holes.  Since I wasn't <i>that</i> determined to construct
additional parts for this initial test, I ended up just holding the tubes in
position using the treaded spacers attached to one of them for guidance.
Needless to say, this wasn't very stable.  But, I did manage to get the
combination to lase, if erratically.  It looked like the potential was there
for a high photon flux but without precise adjustment of the 5 degrees of
freedom (X and Y between the bores; relative pitch, yaw, and roll) - plus
cleaning the Brewster windows - there was no way to do anything consistent
to optimize circulating power.
<p>
So, I constructed an adapter plate to correct for the difference in Brewster
orientations.  Instead of using a set of 4, full length threaded spacers, I
used 2 sets of shorter spacers.  They are attached using an aluminum plate with
offset holes.  With this contraption, I am able to obtain stable output.
Apparently, the bore of the HeNe tube in each of these laser heads is aligned
quite precisely with the axis of the cylindrical case - alignment is optimized
when all the adjustment screws are tight.  So, the only variables are X and
Y position to center one bore relative to the other.
<p>
Given the distance between the two HR mirrors - about 60 cm, this turns out
to be close to a confocal cavity.  The beam waist is in the center and quite
narrow - perhaps 0.75 mm - considering the large diameter bores.  The assembly
will lase with either tube energized but circulating power increases
substantially when both are powered as expected.  However, I was somewhat
disappointed in that the circulating power and reflections from the Brewster
windows doesn't seem to be that much more, if any, than with a single laser
head and decent external HR mirror.  But, I guess this is what should be
expected: There will be double the available (real) power but also double the
total losses so the circulating power remains about the same as with one tube
and an external HR.  What it does permit, though, is the placement of optics
with much greater losses inside the cavity without causing lasing to cease
entirely.  For example, a high quality clean microscope slide can be inserted
almost perpendicular to the laser axis and then tilted gradually resulting in
periodic angles where there is lasing, thus acting as a sort of mode filter or
etalon.  For an explanation of this phenomenon (which shouldn't work at all
just based on reflection losses), see the section:
<A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioipuwl">Perpendicular Uncoated Windows in a Low Gain
Laser</A>.  Too bad there isn't any way to extract useful beam power - the only
outputs at present are the 2 pairs of reflections from the Brewster windows.
<p>
I then decided to see what would happen if the area of the circulating flux
was shielded from air currents by wrapping the tubes with some clear plastic.
Without the wrap, any dust particles in the air would just cross the beam
almost instantly without being affected in any detectable way.  Now, however,
if not actually being attracted to the beam, the dust particles were at least
lingering there for a very long time.  Perhaps it was may imagination or
inspired wishful thinking or just a manifestation of the internal convection
currents set up by the warm tube-ends, but it appeared as though some of the
individual bright specks would tend to travel along the beam, occasionally as
far as the Brewster windows, before disappearing.  Perhaps this is a
poor-man's version of <i>optical tweezers</i> where high photon flux can be
used to capture and manipulate small objects like biological cells or aerosol
particles.  (Such a scheme would also work, of course, with any other
sufficiently high power beam but the tandem dual tube setup allowed the area
of the beam to be easily enclosed.)

<h3><A NAME="chnsmotj">Mirror/Optics Test Jig Using One-Brewster HeNe Laser
 Tube</A></h3>

If the internal HR mirror of a one-Brewster HeNe (or other) laser tube has a
long enough radius (RoC = 2 times the focal length), it should be possible to
extend the resonator quite a distance out from the Brewster window.  With a
flat external mirror, this would be to R distance from the HR, longer with a
curved mirror external mirror.
<p>
So, I am building a jig that would allow a mirror (or other optic) to be
fastened in position and aligned, and then moved along the axis of the tube, 
from just beyond the Brewster window to about 30 cm further away while
maintaining alignment (more or less).  See <A HREF="obtjig1.gif">Mirror/Optics
Test Jig Using a One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube</A>.  For the optical rail, I
salvaged the ball bearing slides and pen carriage from a defunct strip chart
recorder (the same one that yielded the metal stock for my two-Brewster laser
and other projects, very useful!).  This isn't quite the equivalent of a
$2,000 Newport slide but scroungers can't be too selective. :)  I mounted a
mirror/optics mount similar to others I've used for laser resonators (a fixed
and movable plate fastened at 3 corners using cap screws and lockwashers for
the springs) rigidly to the carriage.  The mounting surface will accomodate
both the endplates of HeNe tubes like the SP-084-1 as well as the
<A HREF="mircel1.gif">Simple Mounting Cell for Salvaged HeNe Laser Tube
Mirrors</A>.
<p>
To align the entire rig, I installed a planar mirror for an OC on the carriage
and aligned it for maximum output.  Then, using the beam spot visible on the
OC, I adjusted the height of the one-Brewster laser head at both ends (just
using the slop in the bolt holes) and the side-to-side position of the rails
so that the spot was centered at both ends of the carriage's travel.  It isn't
perfect but I can pretty much maintain lasing from end-to-end with only minor
fluctuations due to imperfect alignment.  The simple mirror mount is quite
precise and quite adequate for fine adjustment even at the far end of the
rails.
<p>
This test jig will permit various mirrors to be installed in an adjustable
length resonator and provide easy access to an extended space inside the
cavity. And with an external HR mirror and resulting high photon flux, this
setup should work reasonably well as a high-tech insect attractor (with unknown
consequences at present) though I bet insects are blind to 632.8 nm light. :)
<p>
Some initial experiments:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Using a planar mirror, lasing could be maintained with almost 30 cm between
 the Brewster window and the mirror (greater than 55 cm between mirrors).
 Assuming the HR mirror is curved, the cavity will be stable until r = L (thus
 forming a hemispherical resonator configuration) where r is the radius of
 curvature of the HR and L is the distance between the HR and OC).  These
 results would be consistent with an HR that has a radius of curvature of 60 cm
 as I've been informed for these one-Brewster HeNe tubes.
<p>
<li>The mode structure changes as the distance between mirrors is adjusted.  At
 the limit just before lasing ceases at maximum L, the beam is quite narrow and
 may approach TEM00 though I haven't actually confirmed this.  In between, the
 number and configuration of the mode spots varies dramatically.  But why
 should I spoil all the fun!  You will have to do the experiments yourself. :)
<p>
<li>With the OC from another deceased SP084-1 HeNe tube, lasing would continue
 over the full extent of travel of my test rig.  Since this mirror is curved,
 the cavity could be stable until L = r(HR) + r(OC) at which point it will form
 a spherical cavity.  I guess I need a longer setup.
<p>
 But something absolutely fascinating happens when L equals exactly 60 cm. :)
</ul>
<p>
An alternative to the ball bearing slide which should really be just about
as good and can be made almost any length desired is to use 1"x1" right angle
aluminum stock for the rail (with the corner up) and a similar short piece
positioned on top of it holding the mirror mount.  Or, find a defunct printer
and salvage the tracks and head mounting.  Or, better yet, a pen plotter:
The pen assembly is mounted on a ball bearing carriage which moves on tracks
that are very precise and may be quite long (e.g., greater than 34 inches for
an E size plotter!).  And, no one wants those beasts nowadays having replaced
them with faster lower hassle ink jet technology.
<p>

Using One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube</A>.

<h3><A NAME="chnslttf">HeNe Laser Tube Test Fixture</A></h3>

I have also built a setup similar to the basic one-Brewster tube laser using
the salvaged aluminum tube from a different (deceased) one-Brewster laser head
which originally housed a Hughes style one-Brewster HeNe tube that had been
broken in half.  As far as I can tell, it may have been in a fire as two
other laser heads were destroyed in a similar manner and one of them had a
very melted Alden connector!  I got them from a laser surplus place (free
along with some other stuff), who of course, didn't have any idea what
happened.  The label on the head (which also appeared to be heat damaged) said
LHB-568 which probably meant it was the Melles Griot model 05-LHB-568 (surplus
places may drop the '-05').  The tube looks similar to my 05-LGB-580 (green,
see below) but with a normal (red) HR - a high Q (and no doubt very expensive)
design with an optically contacted fused silica Brewster window (I saved that
at least!).
<p>
The head is of slightly different construction than the CLIMET 9048 and
includes two sets of Nylon screws (4 each) about 6 inches apart to support and
fine adjust the position of the actual HeNe tube.  After removing the remains
of the old tube and a thorough cleaning the aluminum cylinder turned out to be
ideal for use in testing one-Brewster and 0 degree window HeNe tubes.  Bare
tubes can be easily installed and then fine adjusted with four degrees of
freedom (front X,Y and rear X,Y) to precisely center and align the bore to
the mirror or other optics.

 similarly configured.  (For details on this tube, see the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmdim">Damage to Mirror Coatings of Internal Mirror
 Laser Tubes</A>.)
</ul>

Both Melles Griot and Hughes style tubes can be easily installed.  Initially,
I used this setup to test several bare 05-LHB-570s (one from a disassembled
CLIMET 9084, a pair of similar tubes from another source, and another pair
of similar size tubes that had the Brewster window at the anode-end (stay
clear of the high voltage!).
<p>
A very similar setup can be built using the aluminum cylinder from a defunct
HeNe laser head or other sort of pipe and 8 nylon thumbscrews with blunt ends.
Carefully drill and tap sets of 4 holes equally spaced around the perimeter
of the cylinder at 2 locations selected to hold your tube(s) securely.  As
with the commercial laser head described above, 4 rather than 3 screws allow
for more intuitive adjustment of tube position for fine alignment.  The entire
assembly can be secured with clamps or (via additional holes) with screws and
brackets.

<h2>External Mirror Laser Using HeNe Tube with Missing Mirror Coating</h2>

I was given a Melles Griot 05-LHP-120 HeNe laser tube which had a most unique
problem - the coating on the inner surface of the OC mirror had vanished,
probably due to the discharge taking place at times to the mirror mount instead
of the cathode can due to a bad internal connection.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmcv">Mirror Coating Vanishes</A> for more information
on this tube.  Except for the residual annular ring of good mirror coating on
the OC (see <A HREF="lhp120-1.jpg">Melles Griot 05-LHP-120 HeNe Laser Tube with
Missing OC Mirror Coating</A>), this tube could be mistaken for something
like a Melles Griot 05-WHR-570, a real window HeNe tube.
<p>
Although everyone including my inside contact at a major HeNe laser company
said it would be impossible to get anything out of the damaged tube, I refused
to give up even though none of my initial tests resulted in any coherent
photons.   However, the appearance of the window (formerly, the OC mirror)
was just soooo perfect that I couldn't give up. :)

<h3><A NAME="chnwtl1">Persuading the Tube to Lase</A></h3>

I can now report some success in getting this tube to lase with an external
mirror - though just barely at first.  Using the setup shown in
<A HREF="winhene1.gif">Window HeNe Laser Tube Mounted in Test Fixture</A>, I
was able to get perhaps two to three whole <i>microwatts</i> (that's 2 to 3 &micro;W
- count 'em all!) of output power at 632.8 nm - just detectable on my laser
power meter - with the HR mirror from a deceased Spectra-Physics 084-1 HeNe
tube.  I used a 1 mW HeNe laser to confirm that the internal HR mirror was
correctly adjusted by lining its beam up with the window tube's bore and
checking that the reflected spot was centered in its output aperture.  Then,
without moving anything, I installed that SP-084-1 HR mirror and tweaked it
so that the spot reflected from it was also centered.  After powering up the
window tube and a bit of jiggling, I got the weakest imaginable flashes -
evidence of lasing -  erratically while the discharge was going to the mirror
mount.  At first I thought it needed the extra gain of the discharge inside
the mirror mount to kick it over the threshold but later I got it to lase when
the discharge reverted back to its proper home in the cathode, though possibly
with lower power (if that is possible!).  In both cases, everything must be
extremely borderline because even after fine tuning the HR and external mirror
alignment, the output never quite settles down but varies in intensity and
comes and goes seemingly at random.  Even a slight change in the alignment of
the window (by adjusting the locking collar) affects output power (what of it
there is!).  Oh well, an interesting exercise if nothing else but perhaps not
worth writing home about.  But I think I could get a carrot to lase at this
point.  :)

<h3><A NAME="chnwtl2">Obtaining Respectable Output Power</A></h3>

A few days later, I tried the OC mirror from one of those SP-084-1 tubes.  To
my surprise, that worked much better in the output power department - up to
.15 mW (yes folks, that's milliwatts!).  Then I moved the OC mirror about an
inch closer to the end of the tube - now about 1 inch away - and that boosted
the peak power to about .3 mW!  But it still appeared to be very erratic -
flickering and coming and going at random even when the discharge was
perfectly stable.  And, even just blowing past the end of the tube changed
output power noticeably!  Had it been operating just at threshold with the HR
mirror, I would not have expected <i>any</i> output at all with the additional
loss of close to 1 percent of the OC mirror (which has around 99 percent
reflectivity).  What this suggests is that the losses from the original OC
glass are low enough that the laser is operating well above threshold for the
tube's gain but between the reflections from the front and back surface of the
OC mirror glass and, several longitudinal modes are competing for attention.

<h3><A NAME="chnwtl3">Analysis of the Strange Behavior</A></h3>

Here is the configuration:
<p>
<PRE>

            Internal              Original OC     External
               HR                   X1   X2     SP-084-1 OC

                | ===============    )    )          )
                &lt;-------- L1 -------->
                &lt;---------------- L2 ---------------->

</PRE>
<p>
In fact, it appears that the contribution of the slight reflection from the
inner surface of the OC glass (X1) is actually necessary for lasing.  But,
this forms a dual Fabry-Perot resonator with 3 reflective surfaces.  Ignoring
the AR coated outer surface of the original OC glass (X2), these are the
internal HR mirror, the inner surface of the original OC (X1), and external
SP-084-1 OC mirror.  With such a configuration, the alignment and even length
of each half of the cavity becomes extremely critical.  As confirmation,
pressing on the mirror mount toward the tube (not changing alignment) resulted
in the beam coming and going as the length of the overall resonator (between
the tube's HR and external OC) changed ever so slightly and the permitted
modes shift compared to those inside the HeNe tube (between its HR and X1).
In essence, what is created is an interferometer which includes the inside of
the HeNe tube.  Each cycle represents a shift in position of the order of a
wavelength of 632.8 nm light - gentle pressure on the supposedly rigid mirror
mount would cause it to go through a dozen such cycles!
<p>
(A fully accurate mathematical treatment of the topic of multiple cavity
effects is way beyond the scope of this document but should be present in
a comprehensive laser text.  What follows is more along the lines of
hand-waving to just give the general idea.)
<p>
The combination of the critical alignment of the intermediate and external
mirrors, and the continuously changing lengths of the parts of the resonator
made any determination of causes of the erratic behavior very confusing.
Observing the fluctuating output power in this new light (no pun....), a cycle
of about 20 seconds to a minute became apparent - almost certainly due to the
heating and expansion of the tube cavity length (L1) relative to the total
resonator length (L2).  So, if I were to wait until the temperature of the
tube stabilized, much of the erratic behavior should disappear.
<p>
The general resonator arrangement is shown in <A HREF="dualres.gif">HeNe Laser
Resonator with Intermediate Mirror</A> (not to scale).  The L1 and L2 modes
drift past each other as the tube expands and the distances change.  When a
peak of the weak L1 mode function coincides with an L2 mode at a portion of
the HeNe gain curve with a sufficiently high gain, output power is at a
maximum.  For the setup above, the overall gain is sufficient for lasing only
about 20 percent of the time.  However, that cycle isn't sinusoidal since the
L1 and L2 modes are moving with respect to the HeNe gain curve and each-other.
In the center of the gain  curve, there is a smooth from 0 output to maximum
power and back again. However, where two L1 modes are approximately balanced
on either side, lasing could start with one and jump to the other resulting in
the more random behavior described above. 
<p>
And as if that's not enough, the curvatures of the middle surfaces (X1 and X2)
complicate matters!  There should be an optimal distance from the external
(also curved) OC to the tube where the wavefronts will have the same shape
for best constructive reinforcement.  However, given that the curvature of
the original OC was designed to produce a parallel output beam, it may be that
a flat external OC would match the wavefront best, though I've yet to get a
flat external mirror to work at all.
<p>
Assuming the reflection from X2 can be ignored, the change in L1 relative to
L2 is the major cause of the instability and fluctuating output power with
contributions from wavefront shape due to the (curved reflective surfaces) as
well as the presence of an internal Brewster plate (not shown) in this
linearly polarized HeNe tube.  What a mess! :)
<p>
I later noticed that this analysis is somewhat incomplete.  There is also
reflection from the OC to X1 which needs to be in phase with the other two.
This will happen automagically when an integer number of wavelengths fit
between the HR and OC AND HR and X1.  However, given this additional condition,
I believe the response function will be more peaked with narrower areas of
lasing with respect to X1 position - which would appear to agree with the
observed behavior.  How's that for hand waving? :)
<p>
It has been suggested that this power fluctuations are simply due to normal
model cycling with a low gain resonator.  I don't believe this to be the
case for two reasons:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The original OC mirror glass of the 05-LHP-120 must be properly aligned
 to get the most output power, perhaps to get any output power.  If it weren't
 involved in the lasing process, shifting it slightly off axis should have
 had no significant effect.
<p>
<li>The general behavior is very similar whether an HR or OC (about 1 percent
 transmission) are used for the external mirror.  If simple modes cycling were
 to blame, I would have expected a much higher percentage of on-time with the
 HR than the OC since the overall losses would be much lower.  I later tried
 an OC with over 2 pecent transmission (from a 20 mW HeNe tube).  While output
 power was a tad less than with the 1 percent OC, everything else was similar.
</ol>
<p>
It is well known that an optical flat or etalon with two uncoated surfaces
can be inserted into a low gain laser cavity like this with minimal losses if
positioned at an angle close to the perpendicular such that destructive
interference takes place for the lasing wavelength at its surfaces resulting
in almost no reflections.  The mechanism for this is explained in the section:
<A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioipuwl">Perpendicular Uncoated Windows in a
Low Gain Laser</A>.  Perhaps what I should do is find a plate with one AR
coated surface and attach this to the OC - which should be equivalent
to a pair of non-AR coated surfaces.  Then, just maybe, the combination would
permit this laser to operate more normally. :)

<h2>Inexpensive Home-Built Frequency or Intensity Stabilized HeNe Laser</h2>

So you need a frequency stabilized HeNe laser?  Or, maybe you'd just like
to be able to impress your friends by saying you have a laser with a
frequency of exactly 473.61254 THz!  Here's how to do it cheap
with similar performance to systems costing thousands of dollars.
In fact, a perfectly usable stabilized HeNe laser can be built with 
less than 10 parts in addition to the laser tube and its power
supply!
<p>
First, some of the issues involved in stabilizing a HeNe laser are addressed.
<p>
After that, its on to stabilization using a single photodiode and very short
HeNe laser tube.  This is the simplest approach since only a single
photodiode and no polarizing beamsplitter is needed, it requires a very
short HeNe laser tube.
<p>
Then, several sections deal with the more common and only marginally more
complex two mode stabilization techniques that provide better performance
and allow for greater flexibility in selecting a suitable HeNe laser tube.
<p>
There is also information on two-frequency Zeeman split HeNe
lasers and intensity stabilization without regard to frequency.

<h3><A NAME="chnsmdms">Single Mode or Dual Mode Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

It might seem intuitively obvious that building a single frequency stabilized
laser using a tube that operates on only a single longitudinal mode would be
easier, better, or perhaps even essential.  But this isn't true at all.
<p>
The issue here isn't necessarily whether a HeNe laser tube operates on a
single longitudinal mode, or more than one.  But, rather whether the
feedback circuitry uses a single photodiode to monitor the amplitude of
1 mode, or two photodiodes to monitor the amplitudes of 2 orthogonal modes.
<p>
Starting with a tube that supports 2 or 3 (or sometimes even 4) modes as long
as there is a way of extracting a single mode so single frequency operation
is guaranteed when the laser has stabilized has advantages:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Using the ratio of the power in two adjacent modes, rather than the
 power of a single mode, provides superior frequency stability.
 The ratio - usually set to be 1:1 - will remain quite constant with respect
 to absolute frequency but the power in each mode may vary as the tube warms
 up and over the tube's lifetime as it ages with use.  However.  The exception
 is when the laser is to be intensity stabilized.  Then, a single mode
 (rather than the ratio of two modes) is compared to a reference in the
 feedback loop.  Since adjacent modes are generally orthogonally polarized
 in a random polarized HeNe laser, it is a simple matter to use a polarizing
 beamsplitter to provide two photodiode channels which will then represent
 adjacent mode signals.
<p>
<li>Likewise, separating out a single mode for the single frequency output
 is easily done using a polarizing filter or polarizing beamsplitter.  Even
 a 9 inch (225 mm) tube will only oscillate on at most 3 modes when one of
 them is nearly centered on the gain curve.  When these lasers are frequency
 stabilized with 2 adjacent modes of equal power (ratio of 1:1), this
 prevents any other modes from oscillating.  For intensity stabilization,
 the dominant mode is locked closer to the center of the gain curve and there
 may be 2 other modes lasing, but they won't appear in the final output since
 they are orthogonally polarized relative to the dominant mode and blocked by
 the polarizing optics.
<p>
<li>HeNe laser tubes supporting 2 or 3 modes are much more common than true
 single mode tubes.  In fact, true single mode tubes are virtually
 non-existent.  Even tubes as short as 4 inches (about 100 mm), produce
 two modes during part of the  mode sweep, though they are probably single
 mode much of the time.  And the longer tubes can be designed to have
 much higher output power.
</ol>
<p>
As general guidelines assuming the doppler-broadened neon gain curve is
about 1.5 GHz FWHM and gain is insufficient for lasing beyond the FWHM:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maximum of 1 mode:</b> The tube would need to be under 4 inches
 (100 mm) between mirrors so that the modes are more than about 1.5 GHz
 apart.  Such tubes do not exist commercially.  The reason is that aside
 from the low power that would be available from such tubes, the mode sweep
 would be 100 percent - the output would vary periodically from nothing to
 full power as the tube warmed up!
<p>
 If such a tube did exist, it could be stabilized but would still require
 a polarizer between the tube and the photodiode to guarantee that the
 output was always polarized the same way when it stabilized.
<p>
<li><b>Maximum of 2 modes:</b> The tube would need to be under 8 inches
 (200 mm) between mirrors so the modes are more than 750 MHz apart and
 three modes would not fit.
<p>
 This tube could be stabilized using either the 2 mode ratio or 1 mode
 amplitude technique almost anywhere desired on the gain curve.
<p>
<li><b>Maximum of 3 modes:</b> The tube would need to be under 12 inches.
 (300 mm) between mirrors so the modes are more than 500 MHz apart and
 four modes would not fit.
<p>
 This tube could be stabilized using the 2 mode ratio technique with a
 ratio near 1:1.  It could also be stabilized using the 1 mode amplitude
 technique if the dominant mode were positioned near the center of the
 gain curve and the output polarizer only passed that mode.
<p>
<li><b>Maximum of 4 modes:</b> The tube would need to be under 16 inches.
 (400 mm) so the modes are more than 375 MHz apart and five modes would
 not fit.
<p>
 This tube could be stabilized using the 1 mode amplitude technique if the
 dominant mode were positioned near the center of the gain curve.  However,
 attempting to stabilize 2 modes with a 1:1 ratio would allow all 4 modes
 to oscillate, which would be unacceptable.  However, such a tube could still
 be used with more sophisticated frequency stabilization techniques such as
 Lamb-dip or Pound-Drever-Hall locking.  This is for the advanced course. :)
</ul>
<p>
Now in reality, the gain may be sufficient beyond the FWHM of 1.5 GHz
so that additional low amplitude modes could be present.  Thus, the
maximum lengths given above may be overly generous.  A 9 inch (225 mm)
such as used in commercial stabilized lasers like the SP-117A, will
generally have a rather strong presence of a 3rd mode popping up at
times.
<p>
It should be noted that when the stabilization is optimized for frequency,
the intensity will still be maintained nearly constant, and vice-versa,
but not quite as good as when it's the primary feedback variable.  In
principle, both frequency and intensity could be stabilized at the same
time by adding a feedback loop for laser tube current to output power
independent of mode position, but I don't know of any commercial
HeNe lasers that provide that.
<p>
Beam sampling can be done using the waste beam from the HR-end of the tube
if it is of adequate power and the power relative to the output beam
doesn't change significantly with a change in tube temperature.  The
advantage of waste beam sampling is that it doesn't reduce the available
output power and the sampling optics don't affect the main beam.
However, some tubes produce a very low power waste beam
or one that changes relative to the output beam as the tube warms up.
(This is generally due to etalon effects inside the mirror glass between
the mirror coating and uncoated outer surface modulating HR reflectivity
as a function of temperature.)
The main beam out the front can also be used but will result
in some reduction in output power, and the sampling optics have to be
of high quality and very clean so as not to degrade the output beam.
Any technique that obtains the desired
polarization components will work.  These include polarizing beamsplitters,
non-polarizing beamsplitters followed by polarizers, and Brewster-angle
plates.  One advantage of using the latter is cost since pieces of a decent
quality microscope slide or cover slip will work fine to sample the main
beam by producing near-zero reflection of one orientation and 10 or 12
percent reflection of the other to the photodiode.
<p>
The electronics required for stabilization using 1 mode (1 photodiode with
or without polarizer) or 2 modes (2 photodiodes and polarizing
beamsplitter) isn't all that much different and as noted above, either
technique can be used with a 2 (or 3) mode tube.  The two mode approach
is better for frequency stabilization while the single mode approach is
better for intensity stabilization, though not by a huge amount.
<p>
The output beam may consist of only a single mode - the other may be
blocked by the beam sampling optics (if on the OC-end) or an
optional polarizing filter (if beam sampling is on the HR-end).  Other
stabilized HeNe lasers may use a special tube with an internal heater or
piezo transducer to control cavity length.  See the sections:

Lasers</A>.
<p>
While it is very easy to construct a laser that locks to one or two modes
keeping them generally stationary as described in subsequent sections,
providing performance comparable to commercial systems - order of 1 part in
10<sup>8</sup> - requires careful attention to design and implementation:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Take time in selecting the HeNe laser tube:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Where output power is important, a tube up to 9 or 10 inches will
  result in at most 2 lasing modes and an even longer tube may
  still have few enough modes when stabilized.  See the previous section.
<p>
 <li>Check for a "wedged" HR mirror by looking for a ghost beam along with
  the waste beam out the back of the laser tube.  If a ghost beam is NOT
  present, there is no wedge, and the backreflections from the outer
  surface of the HR mirror will both tend to destabilize the laser as
  well as cause the waste beam power to vary due to the temperature
  of the tube and thus not track output beam power (important if the
  waste beam is to be used for mode sampling).  Minimal power
  variation is particularly critical if intensity (one mode) stabilization
  is to be implemented.  Most high quality HeNe laser tubes are at least
  supposed to have a wedged HR mirror (though mistakes have been known to
  happen!).  But many barcode scanner tubes have the
  problem of varying waste beam power with respect to output beam power
  due to lack of wedge in the HR mirror.  The Spectra-Physics 088s I've
  tested don't have this problem.  But LGR-7641s and 098s - which are
  often used interchangeably in barcode applications - do.  Indeed, many
  if not the majority of 6 inch barcode scanner tubes have variable waste
  beam power.
<p>
  So whatever waste beam peculiarities may be present with one sample
  of any model tube doesn't necessarily mean they all will behave similarly
  since what happens at the back of the tube or even the slight output beam
  ripples would not impact the laser's important specifications.  Checking
  for wedge and then testing the tube is the only sure approach.
<p>
  Adding a wedge to a problem tube is theoretically possible, but the
  index matching has to be near perfect - even a 0.001% residual reflection
  at the parallel surface boundary will result in more than a 1 percent
  waste beam power variation.
  Where the HR mirror is frosted, rippled, or fine ground (non of these
  are common but may be present in rare cases), adding index matching cement
  and a wedge will still be desirable to minimize backreflections, though
  the effects uncorrected won't be anywhere as severe as with a plane
  parallel HR mirror glass.
<p>
  More on this issue including an analysis and plots showing the waste
  beam behavior of otherwise normal red laser heads, as well as possible
  remedies, can be found in the section:
  <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrpvdl">Power Variations Due to Lack of HR Wedge</A>.
<p>
 <li>Monitor the mode sweep as the tube warms up.  The most desirable tubes
  will be those that are not "flippers" (they have smooth mode sweep), and there
  must be no erratic behavior.  Testing can be done with a polarizer
  of some sort to select one of the polarized modes, a simple photodiode,
  and a multimeter on the mA range.  Enclose the tube in some sort of
  thermal insulation so it will get at least as hot as when installed with
  a heater in your stabilized laser.  The mode(s) should change smoothly
  from close to zero to maximum and back in a periodic but slowing cycle
  with no jumps either way.  The use of a data acquisition system would make
  this much less of a hassle than watching a meter readout for an hour! :)
<p>
  However, note that a flipper that always flips on the same slope of the mode
  sweep regardless of temperature or the presence of small magnetic fields,
  will also work fine.  A tube that switches from flipping to non-flipping
  behavior, or vice-versa depending on temperature may also be suitable.
  All that's required is to be able to select the feedback polarity to lock
  on the slowly varying (non-flipping) slope of the mode sweep.  This can be
  done in the electronics or by using the appropriate polarization(s) in
  the beam sampler.  But some flippers are inherently unstable and extremely
  sensitive to environmental conditions and back-reflections, so this would
  need to be checked.  The only downside would seem to be that the option to
  lock on the "blue" side (upper frequency) or "red" side (lower frequency)
  of the gain curve won't be available for each mode, so the desired one
  (should this matter to anyone!) will have to be selected optically with
  a polarizer.
 </ul>
<p>
 Unfortunately, I don't know of any way to select a tube by make, model,
 or length to guarantee acceptable performance in this applcation.
 Where a particular characteristic like variable waste beam power
 is irrelevant for the intended application, even tubes with identical
 model numbers may differ dramatically in waste beam behavior and stability.
 Spending some time to identify the best available tube will avoid
 loads of frustration later.  The tubes used in many commercial stabilized
 HeNe lasers are common models that have been specially selected for good
 behavior.
<p>
<li>Provide adequate optical power to the photodiode(s) from the waste beam
 if possible, or from a beam sampler in the output beam.
 A minimum of 10 &micro;W to each photodiode is probably comfortable.
 But, sampling the output beam, while more complex and reducing the
 usable output power by 5 to 10 percent, may be less trouble
 in the long run since there are no issues of inconsistent waste beam and
 output beam power.  Non-polarized beamsplitters can also be used with
 polarizing filters in front of each photodiode.  You don't need to buy
 polarizing filter stock - every LCD panel has a polarizing film pasted
 to the front and back surfaces.  Their extinction ratio is typically only
 about 30:1 but that's adequate for this purpose.  And I bet there
 are plenty of dead gadgets around your place with LCDs! :)  Careful use
 of a razer blade will free the film and WD-40 will clean up the adhesive
 residue.
<p>
<li>Prevent back-reflections into the laser tube from the photodiode(s), 
 polarizer(s), or output optics.  Angle all optics and the photodiode(s).
 Block room light from hitting the photodiode(s).  Include apertures to
 only allow the waste or sampled beam to pass, not the bore light.
<p>
<li>Provide thermal isolation of the tube assembly from rapid environmental
 changes such as air currents.  An aluminum head cylinder or Plexiglas
 case will work.  But don't insulate the laser to the point where heat
 can't excape - that is needed to enable the feedback loop to be closed!
<p>
<li>Provide mechanical isolation of the tube assembly using resilient
 mounting techniques (springs, RTV silicone, etc.).
<p>
<li>Use a regulated HeNe laser power supply for the tube.  Although some
 commercial systems use special low noise power supplies, not all do.
 But one of those would be even better.  A high quailty supply that runs
 on low voltage DC may be almost as good.
<p>
<li>Use regulated linear DC power supplies for the controller.
<p>
<li>Use proper analog design and construction techniques to minimize noise
 pickup.  These include a single point ground and shielding, twisted pairs,
 and/or filtering of low level signals.
</ul>
<p>
In fact, typical commercial stabilized HeNe lasers are really quite
simple despite their high price, burying a common HeNe laser tube inside
their expensive laser head with not much more electronics in their
main feedback loop than a couple of op-amps.  For example, the Coherent
model 200 uses a standard Melles Griot HeNe laser tube but it has been
selected to be a non-flipper and so forth based on criteria similar to
those presented above.  It produces two longitudinal modes, an external
heater, and orthogonally polarized beam sampling.  (Yes, the
tube is from Melles Griot, not Coherent!)  The Spectra-Physics models
117 and 117A (and identical Melles Griot 05-STP-901) use an SP-088-2
or the equivalent Melles Griot 05-LHR-088 tube, similar to
those in barcode scanners, but higher power.  Using both polarizations
provides better frequency stability since their ratio can be easily
maintained to be equal, independent of output power, which can vary
as the tube warms up and as it ages with use.  The 117A and 05-STP-901
also can be intensity stabilized which maintains the output constant
based on feedback from a single mode.  Many other companies have sold or
still sell these types of stabilized HeNe lasers including Newport before they
merged with Spectra-Physics (and probably acquired the technology from
a long defunct company called Laseangle), Zygo, Teletrac, Nikon, Micro-g
Solutions, SIOS, NEOARK, Nikon, Mark Tech, and many more.

<h3><A NAME="chnshlts">Stabilizing a HeNe Laser Tube Using a Single Mode</A></h3>

By using a short HeNe laser tube with a large mode sweep percentage
(or with the addition of a polarizer to isolate a single
mode), the laser can be locked to a specific power of the waste beam (or
sampled output beam) with minimal circuitry.  This results in the simplest
implementation.  But if you want to build a stabilized laser,
consider one of the two mode approaches described later in this chapter.
They are only slightly more complex but potentially can provide
better performance.
<p>
The following description was inspired by the paper: "A Very
Simple Stabilized Single Mode HeNe Laser for Student Laboratories and Wave
Meters", B. Stahlberg, P. Jungner, and T, Fellman, American Journal of
Physics 58(9), September 1990, pp. 878-881.  Copyright American Association
of Physics Teachers.  I have edited the description just a bit and extended
it to allow the use of a wider variety of tubes.
<p>
(Portions from: Steve Roberts.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find a 0.5 to 1.5 mW (actual output power) random polarized HeNe tube in
 the range of 4 to 9 inches (100 to 225 mm) from mirror to mirror.  Barcode
 scanner tubes work just fine.  These are readily available from surplus
 dealers and on eBay.
<p>
<li>Test the HeNe tube by installing it in a steady mount with no drafts
 or air currents around it.  Apply power and check the following as it
 warms up for at least 20 minutes.  Check for the following:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Adequate output power:</b> If the main beam isn't strong enough for
  your needs, then there's little point on using the tube.  However, simply for
  an experimental stabilized laser, this is generally of little consequence.
  However, a tube longer than 9 or 10 inches may have too many longitudinal
  modes to allow stabilization with a single mode output.
<p>
 <li><b>Well behaved mode sweep:</b> Slowly rotate a polarizer (e.g., Polaroid
  sheet) in the output to locate the axis of the polarization for the modes.
  Most random polarized HeNe laser tubes will have adjacent modes which are
  othogonally polarized with a fixed orientation.  As the modes sweep through
  the neon gain curve, the output power from the polarizer should vary
  smoothly from a minimum to a maximum with a cycle that gets longer as the
  tube gets warmer and the rate of expansion slows.  At 4 orientations 90
  degrees apart, the output power will vary the most and for a short tube,
  will likely go to zero and stay there periodically.  This is good.  Mark
  these orientations on the tube for future reference.  But if the output
  power changes erratically, abruptly, very little, or not at all, the tube
  should NOT be considered suitable for the stabilized laser project.
<p>
 <li><b>Consistent waste beam and output beam power:</b>  If the waste beam
  will be used for sampling, this is important for your sanity.  It also
  has implications for stability even the waste beam is not being used
  for anything.  Monitor the power in the waste beam and output beam
  simultaneously to assure that they track each-other fairly closely.
  With some mirrors, the temperature of the mirror has a strong effect
  on reflectivity due to etalon effects inside the mirror glass between
  the mirror coating and uncoated outer surface resulting in a periodic
  variation in effective HR reflectivity as a function of temperature.  As an
  example, for a 1 mW tube with an HR mirror reflectivity of 99.97 percent
  producing 30 &micro;W in the waste beam a change of even 0.01 percent (from
  99.97 to 99.96 percent) would result in an increase of 10 &micro;W in the
  waste beam.  If the waste beam was used for intensity stabilization,
  that would be a 33 percent change in the amplitude!  But, it may be
  difficult to find a tube that is really perfect in this regard since
  it's not something that most applications care much about.  An even simpler
  initial test is to shine the waste beam on a white card in a dark room and
  look for a ghost beam off to the side.  If one is present, then the
  HR mirror was ground with wedge and is less likely to suffer from
  this problem.  If there is no wedge, it will be necessary to add
  an angled plate to the HR mirror using an index matching cement (5 minute
  Epoxy may be satisfactory if care is taken not to trap bubbles in it
  during mixing.)
 </ul>
<p>
 The best way to do these tests is to use use a data acquisition system or
 laser power meter with a graphing display capability to monitor the output
 of one of the polarization orientations (through a polarizing filter) for
 the main beam and waste beam.  The power should appear
 along the lines of either the red or blue plot of
 <A HREF="lhr640m2.gif">Plot of Melles Griot 05-LHR-640
 HeNe Laser Tube During Warmup (Polarized)</A>.  The 05-LHR-640 is a
 very short tube so the valleys of the plot may not be as flat or even
 go to zero power on yours.  But the power should always vary smoothly
 with no abrupt changes.  Compare this to
 <A HREF="oem1rfm1.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
 During Warmup</A> and the closeup of flipping behavior in
 <A HREF="oem1rfm2.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
 During First Part of Warmup</A>, which are the mode power variations
 of an otherwise healthy 1 mW HeNe laser head with a chronic case of
 flipperitis for much of the warmup period. :)  The flips are virtually
 instantaneous, probably order of a few hundred photon round trips in the
 laser resonator.  Also note that the frequency of the mode cycles for
 a flipper is double that of a normal tube - each mode would normally be
 what resulted from tracing the continuous curve and not taking the
 discontinuities as is evident in
 <A HREF="oem1rfm3.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
 During First Part of Warmup (Combined)</A>.  So following red-blue-red, etc.,
 ignoring the green lines.
<p>
 However, at some point in the warmup period something very interesting
 occurs: The tube seems to revert to being well behaved!  This only happens
 within a half dozen or so mode sweep cycles of thermal equilibrium and is
 consistent from run to run.  The cause is unknown, nor is it known whether
 the tube would continue to behave if stabilization was attempted.
 It may indeed behave since the temperature at which it would run is well
 above the transition point.
 <A HREF="oem1rfm4.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
 at Transition to Normal Behavior (Combined)</A> shows the abrupt change
 from flipper to non-flipper in stark detail.  Note that the "envelope" of
 the mode plot is virtually unchanged at this point but the green transitions
 have disappeared.  There are at most 3 or 4 additional complete mode cycles
 beyond what is shown and then the temperature of the tube is in equilibrium
 with its surroundings with only small slow fluctuations remaining.
<p>
<li>Obtain a metal film type lab heater that will run off of your power
 supply, or wind a bifilar heating element using resistance wire or even
 fine magnet wire.  A bifilar winding is desirable to cancel the magnetic
 field from the heater and is made by carefully wrapping a pair of wires
 side-by-side for the length of the winding.  Short them at one end and
 drive the coil via the two wires at the opposite end.  Since equal and
 opposite current is flowing along the pair of wires, virtually no
 external magnetic field is generated.  However, an even better arrangement
 (but one very difficult to do by hand) is longitudinal back and forth
 glued to the tube.  This results in a much higher bandwidth and more
 predictable response.  But that's for the advanced course. :)
<p>
 As a guideline, the maximum heater power should be about the same or a bit
 more than that of the HeNe laser tube.  So, for example, if the laser tube is
 4.5 mA at 1,400 V (6.3 W) like the SP-117A, a 7 or 8 W heater should work.
 For a 12 V power supply, this would have a resistance of around 20 ohms.
 The paper actually suggests double this - about 15 W - which is fine as well
 and would provide a wider operating temperature range and faster warmup,
 but also results in higher power dissipation in the driver.
<p>
 A home-built heater can be made from magnet wire salvaged from a relay,
 solenoid, or other similar device.  Magnet wire can also be purchased from an
 electronics distributor.  Or, thin film heaters can be purchased from
 suppliers like <A HREF="http://www.minco.com/">Minco</A>.  Home-built heaters
 are less expensive and easily customized to the desired dimensions and
 resistance/power, but commercial heaters are more convenient since they
 can be moved from one tube to another without unwinding a hundred turns
 or more. :)  But if your time isn't factored in, they are also much more
 expensive - $30 or more for a single heater!
<p>
<li>Mount the tube at its center with a long aluminum ring and RTV Silicone,
 or two rings near the ends as long as the tube is free to expand slightly
 (it doesn't need much - about 0.1 mm!).  However, the center ring mound
 may better isolate the tube from the environment.
<p>
<li>Install this assembly in a tight metal box that keeps out stray light
 and lets the tube reach thermal equilibrium.  Painting the box black inside
 might help to minimize stray reflections causing instability but really
 isn't necessary as long as the sampling optics/photodiode are enclosed.
 You can even put the entire thing in a box with a Plexiglas cover.
<p>
<li>Poke a hole for the output beam in the box.  Use the waste beam off the
 rear mirror to illuminate a broad area photodiode. Using such a photodiode
 eliminates the effects of beam wander on the sensor surface.
 It is very important to arrange the photodiode so there are no
 back-reflections into the laser tube.  Even a very small amount of power back
 into the laser cavity can destabilize it.  At the very least, it will
 increase the noise level, but might also cause the modes to flip
 polarization at random times even for an otherwise well-behaved
 tube.  To prevent back-reflections, angle the photodiode
 (and polarizer) and don't mount them too close to the mirror.  To
 help this, as well as to minimize bore light shining on the photodiode,
 attach something opaque to the mirror that has a hole only large enough
 for the waste beam to pass.  A red filter to block out most of the bore
 light would also be desirable.
<p>
<li>Although a short tube may have up to a 20 percent output power variation
 with mode sweep, most are lower and may make reliable and stable locking
 rather finicky.  More importantly, without some means of locking to a
 specific mode polarization, the polarization of the output when stabilized
 will randomly be one of the two orthogonal modes.
 Therefore, I (Sam) recommend adding a polarizer between the
 tube and photodiode, oriented based on the mark placed on the tube, which
 will result in a much larger signal swing and fixed polarization orientation
 when stabilized.  The paper mentions the use of a polarizer, but sort of
 as an afterthought.  The polarizer can just be a tiny piece of a Polaroid
 sheet.
<p>
<li>Any garbage op-amps can be used - 741s, LM358, etc.  Use regulated
 +/-15 VDC power supplies.
<p>
 The photodiode has its anode grounded and its cathode feeds the negative 
 input of the first op-amp and the positive input is grounded.  The value
 of the feedback resistor will depend on the actual amount of power in
 the waste beam or sampled beam.  The paper used 330K ohms for a BPW34
 photodiode and their specific tube, with a 47 pF shunted across the
 330K ohms to assure stability.  (This may not be needed but won't hurt.)
 For typical short Uniphase tubes, 1M or even higher may be desirable to
 obtain a nice large signal swing.
<p>
 The differential amp is a second 741 with a 1M ten turn pot as its feedback
 resistor, and two 10K resistors as its inputs, one on the - terminal and
 one on the +. The plus terminal is fed off the ten turn 50K pot which has a
 1M trim pot on its high side, to set the upper limit. The high side is
 fed to +15 V through the 1M trimmer, and the low side is of course
 grounded.  The negative terminal goes straight to the trans-impedance
 converter's output via the second 10K input resistor.
<p>
 The second op-amp then feeds a Darlington transistor pair made with a small
 signal NPN and a 2N3055 that has the heater in its collector circuit. Use a
 1K between the opamp output and the Darlington base.  Put an ammeter on the 
 heater.
<p>
 And, of course, shield everything.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Principle of operation:</b> When the tube contracts the mode tens to drift
to a higher frequency and thus the intensity of the output beam decreases,
provided you start with a mode on the high side of the gain profile. As the
converter voltage falls it approaches the set point of the pot and the
heater is energized more (set quiescent heat for about 4 watts) the tube
expands, forcing the mode frequency to decrease and sliding the beam to a
higher gain point of the curve.  To ensure your single mode, run the
polarizer test again, adjust the set point so you only have 1 mode with no
drift.  (For the longer tubes, getting a single mode may not be possible
at a reasonable set-point.  So, just add a polarizer in the output.)
<p>
The authors of the original paper achieved a stability of 50 MHz with this
method, over long periods of time, as compared to a commercial polarization
stabilized HeNe using a beat frequency method. This will get you a better
then 1% amplitude (or intensity) stability.  God only knows what it does to
the coherence length, as I have no way to measure that. 
<p>
I (Steve) didn't come up with this, I just built it, and have seen similar
methods used on a surplus measuring interferometer. The nice variation is to
run this beam through a 40 MHz AOM, and beat the frequency shifted beam against
a non-modulated sample, then phase lock it to a 40 MHz crystal, but thats
time consuming and needs a critically designed RF amp and photodiode
circuit as the second order correction. I used a short aerotech tube that
is no longer made.
<p>
The original article gives full theory. They showed a drift as little as 2 MHz
over 15 minute time spans, and as little as +/-6 MHz over an hour compared
to the reference laser, and the locking frequency is repeatable to 50 MHz if
you switch the unit on and off.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
That 50 MHz uncertainty could probably be reduced greatly if the temperature
of the tube was monitored during preheat and then the feedback loop was
enabled at the same temperature every time.
<p>
Note that the feedback loop described above is for all intents and purposes,
pure gain or proportional control.  The paper does suggest using an integrator
and more sophisticated techniques but I suppose since the intent was to
do the simplest possible implementation, there were no details.
<p>
I would expect the coherence length of this laser (or of any other home-built
thermally stabilized HeNe laser) to be quite long at
any given instant - possibly hundreds of meters or in the same league
as a commercial stabilized HeNe laser - if the tube is isolated from
vibration and AC magnetic fields, and the power supply is well
filtered.  What is not available with this scheme, which may be used
in some commercial models, is high bandwidth piezo control of mirror
spacing so there's no way to deal with short term fluctuations.
However, the commercial stabilized HeNe lasers I've seen just use the
heater approach.  I do think that you could do better than the authors
of the paper have achieved and match or exceed the performance of
typical commercial systems with enough care in construction,
particularly with respect to these factors above, as well as feedback
for thermal control, and providing adequate thermal insulation (but
not total isolation).
<p>
By using two longitudinal modes and straddling them on either side of
the gain curve (see the next section), it should even be possible to spec
an <i>absolute</i> wavelength/frequency to 9 or 10 significant figures.
What other device can you build at home that can claim such precision?! :)

I am considering making a kit of parts available to construct a basic one or
two mode stabilized HeNe laser.  This would be suitable for an advanced
hobbyist or an university undergraduate course project.  It would use a
preselected non-flipper 6 inch (150 mm) tube with 12 VDC input HeNe laser
power supply, microscope slides used as Brewster plate polarizing
beamsplitters for the main beam, photodiodes, and a wrap-around heater
for the tube (type to be determined).  I may also include the required
electronic components.  The electrical schematic from which to start
would be the same as that given in the next section, but could be
enhanced if desired to provide separate s and p polarization signals,
for example.  Mounting would be up to the ingenuity of the
student.  Most of the parts are not very expensive but having them
all from one source would simplify things.  And starting with a HeNe laser
tube that is known to be well behaved would eliminate a lot of potential
frustration.  I welcome comments on whether there would be any interest
in such a kit.
<p>
The parts list would go something like:
<p>
<li>Tested HeNe laser tube guaranteed NOT to be a flipper.  0.8 to 1.5 mW,
 150 mm length, mode spacing of 1,063 MHz typical.
<p>
<li>Beam sampler plates (2), to be used at the Brewster angle to provide
 approximately 10 percent of the output power to each polarization from
 the output-end of the tube.
<p>
<li>Silicon photodiodes (2), relatively large area, 0.4 A/W typical
 sensitivity.
<p>
<li>Wire to construct a heater or thin film heater for the tube with
 approximately 25 ohm resistance.
<p>
<li>Quad op-amp, MJE3055T heater driver, assorted resistors and capacitors.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="chnsshnl">Sam's Stabilized Two-Frequency Helium-Neon
 Laser</A></h3>

The approach above can be extended to use a somewhat longer HeNe laser tube,
one having a longidtudinal mode spacing as low as 600 to 700 MHz or one with
a magnet to perform Zeeman splitting, to build a
two-frequency stabilized HeNe laser similar to commercial models.
Before you get too excited about maybe having a HeNe
laser that outputs red and green light, the two frequencies I'm talking about
will differ by 600 MHz to 1 GHz (less than 0.0015 nm at 632.8 nm) for the laser
described in this section and up to only 2 MHz or so (less than 0.000003 nm)
for the two-frequency laser based on Zeeman splitting, below.  Looking at a
600 MHz signal may be stretching it for a home lab but a 2 MHz beat signal can
easily be seen with very modest equipment.
<p>
A two-frequency laser can be built by using a HeNe tube that will support a
pair of longitudinal modes (maybe the same tube as the one used above
or one that is slightly longer) and monitor the two polarization orientations
of the waste beam (from the HR) with with a pair of photodiodes.  A suitable
servo system would then control the heater temperature to equalize the
intensity of the two outputs.  This would result in operation with a pair
of adjacent longitudinal modes of orthogonal polarization separated by a
frequency of c/(2*L).  Whether an 'even' mode and next higher 'odd' one
or an 'odd' mode and next higher 'even' one is stable would depend on the
sign of the feedback equation.  Such a feedback system would not be much
more complex than the one to maintain a single frequency output.  I have
thrown together a very simple and <i>preliminary</i> design which can be
found at <A HREF="stbhene1.gif">Sam's Stabilized Helium-Neon Laser 1</A>.
I was intending to construct it at some point but ended up building the
even simpler one described in the next section instead. :)
<p>
The HeNe laser tube should be one that's random polarized and between 5 to 9
inches in length, rated about 0.5 to 2 mW with a mode spacing of between 1.2
GHz and 600 MHz.  From some quick tests, the shorter tubes seem to have very
pronounced cycling of polarization with almost perfect nulls,
but 3:1 or 4:1 even with the 9 inch tube.  Having the nulls is fine
but the tube has to be able to support two modes simultaneously which means
that there should be some times at which there will be little or no evidence of
polarization of the beam indicating that more than one mode but hopefully
only two modes are oscillating.  Even if up to 3 modes oscillating
at timnes is acceptable if one of them is near the center of the gain curve.
Keeping the tube length below 9 inches should guarantee this.
The tube will be enclosed in a thermal control system consisting of
a bifilar wound heating element, aluminum heat
distribution layer, and outer isolating layer.  Note that this must
<b>not</b> be a totally insulated (adiabatic) system since there is no
way to cool the tube actively.  Thus, thermal conduction to the ambient
is a requirement.  The purpose of the outer layer is to isolate
the tube from air currents and other disturbances that would produce
frequency fluctuations that would occur too quickly to be handled by
the thermal control system.
<p>
The mode sweep behavior of any candidate tube should be tested by monitoring
its output through a polarizer, oriented to produce maximum change from
minimum to maximum signal during mode cycling as the tube warms up.  The
power should vary more or less smoothly without any abrupt jumps or dips
which would indicate that the tube is a "flipper" - one where the modes
suddenly swap polarization states as described above.
<p>
The beam from the HR-end of the tube is passed through a polarizing beam
splitter to create the S and P oriented beams for their respective
photodiodes.  The TL072 op-amp implements a differential integrator
feeding a darlington heater driver.  At first, I was going to use an SG3524
PWM controller chip but then realized that the AC switching frequency would
result in both electrical noise and some residual magnetic fields even with
the bifilar wound heater coil.  Thus, I changed it to a linear regulator.
Depending on the heater power (and thus the maximum power dissipated in the
regulator, a large or forced air-cooled heat sink and/or multiple pass
transistors may be required.
<p>
The heater would be driven during initial warmup at a constant current
around half of what it can safely handle.  At this
power level, the warmup time is not critical as long as it is long enough,
allowing the temperature to stabilize to the point of near equilibrium.
The feedback loop would be off until the tube is close to a
steady state condition due to the balance between its discharge
current heating, thermal input from the heater, and thermal leakage to
the environment.  This point could be determined by detecting when
mode cycles take more than 20 to 30 seconds.  Then, the heater will
have to run at around the same power to maintain lock.  Using a
higher heater power would get to this point faster, but if you wait too
long, the heater will have to run near full power to
maintain it - or may not be able to at all even at full power.
Switching over when the heater can run below half its
maximum current (1/4 power) is probably better.
<p>
After preheating, the control system
would be enabled and will seek a stable point equalizing two
adjacent modes.  If by chance, it started with a pair of modes which
resulted in increased imbalance with higher temperature (greater
distance between mirrors), it would stabilize at the next pair.  If
the feedback loop was switched on too early (even from a cold start!),
the behavior would be dominated by the warmup-expansion due to the
discharge current heating, but even then, it would probably stabilize
eventually.  Experimentation is welcomed. :)

<h3><A NAME="chnh117s">Sam's Home-Built SP-117 Compatible HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The Spectra-Physics model 117 was one of the classic commercial stabilized
HeNe lasers with its successor, the 117A (and the OEM 117C), still in
production.  For more info on this laser, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstsp117">Description of the SP-117A Stabilized Single
Frequency HeNe Laser</A>.  (The SP-117 and SP-117A are similar except that
the latter can operate with intensity stabilization or frequency
stabilization.)  I have constructed a frequency stabilized
HeNe laser from junk parts that consists of a laser head and bare-bones
controller.  The laser head will also operate from an SP-117 or SP-117A
controller, and my controller will also run a stock SP-117 or SP-117A laser
head, with at most minor adjustments to the premap gain settings.  (This
also applies to the Melles Griot 05-STP-901 which is identical to the
SP-117A except for the color of the case and front panel layout.)
<p>
The special - and no doubt very expensive SP-117 (or 117A or 05-STP-901)
laser head, should you need to replace yours - is of the typical design
described above - a common random polarized HeNe laser tube (probably a
Spectra-Physics 088-2 or Melles Griot 05-LHR-088) surrounded by a heater
with polarizing optics and photodiodes to generate feedback signals for
two orthogonal longitudinal modes.
<p>
I used a common barcode scanner HeNe laser tube, a Spectra-Physics model
088 (about 1.4 mW).  This is about half the power of the 088-2 but it
was available. :)  Almost any other random polarized tube would work as long
as it was 9 inches or less between mirrors.
<p>
The heater is about 50 feet of #36 AWG copper magnet wire wound bifilar-style
around the tube on top of the original aluminum wrap after adding a layer
of clear packing tape as insulation insurance.  The bifilar winding
is used to minimize the magnetic field of the heater that would result in
Zeeman splitting - not desirable for this version of the stabilized laser.
The length of wire was chosen to result in approximately the same resistance
as the heater in the SP-117 laser head - about 20 ohms.
<p>
The photodiodes are common types found in barcode scanners and similar
equipment (similar to the
<A HREF="http://www.photonicdetectors.com/pdf/pdbc107.pdf">Photonics
Detectors</A> PDB-107.)  A Polarizing BeamSplitter (PBS) is used to
separate the two modes of the waste beam from the HR mirror.  The
photodiodes are set at an angle to prevent reflections back into the laser.
<p>
The SP-117 controller's HeNe laser power supply runs at 1,700 V at 4.5 mA
for the 088-2 tube.  Therefore, the ballast resistance for the 088 tube was
made 160K so that the power supply in the SP-117 controller would see
about the same operating voltage.  The 4.5 mA is nearly optimal for
this tube as well.
<p>
One concern was that the waste beam may not have enough power for the
photodiode preamps inside the SP-117 controller.  About 25 microwatts
for each of the two polarizations after the beamsplitter is the minimum
that will work reliably with unmodified Spectra-Physics or Melles Griot
controllers.  This is because the feedback resistors are 500K ohm pots
in the preamps.  With 25 &micro;W and the typical 0.4 A/W sensitivity of silicon
photodiodes, this will result in a voltage swing of 5 V.  If the power is
much less than this, additional amplification will be needed.  Or, sample
the output beam instead.  The power of the waste beam from the 088-2 is
about 3 times that of the 088, so this was a concern.
<p>
Final assembly went very smoothly and the completed unit is shown in
<A HREF="sg117s1.jpg">Photo of Sam's SP-117 Compatible Stabilized HeNe Laser
Head</A>.  Some windings of the heater are visible under the plastic covering.
The small black cylinder on the left is the polarizing beamsplitter, borrowed
from an SP-117 laser head.  The photodiodes are attached at the rear and
underneath.  Awhile after the photo was taken, I found a half dead very small
PBS in a Hewlett Packard 5500C interferometer laser head and substituted that,
freeing up the SP-117 PBS to go back to its original home or for other
purposes.  (Part of the coating on the critical diagonal surface had
rotted but there was enough remaining for beam sampling.)  Yes, that's
a piece of quad twisted pair blue Ethernet cable and the highly stable
base is laminated hardwood with a suger maple stain.  Who says optical
systems can't be built on real breadboards. :)
<p>
The system powered up just fine.  Even the polarities of the photodiodes were
correct.  The voltage swing of the photodiodes was much better than I had
feared, about 2.5 V end-to-end (more on this later).  The behavior during
warmup was about the same as with the genuine SP-117 laser heads.  And, after
approximately the normal warmup time, it was quite clear from the photodiode
voltages no longer changing, and the modes no longer changing (as determined by
a polarizing filter), that the tube had locked.  However, the Stabilized
indicator never came on but for a momentary flash or two.  The lock seemed
quite solid with the laser remaining stable as long as it wasn't disturbed.
Blowing on the tube might cause it to lose lock but it would regain it
in at most a few mode cycles.  (The only protection over the heater is
several layers of thick plastic.)  But the stable point was very near one
extreme with one of the two modes nearly centered on the gain curve and
dominating.  This might be desirable to maximize the output power in the
single mode, but is not as stable a location as with both modes on the
slope of the gain curve and of approximately equal power.
<p>
As far as the Stabilized indicator, I think that what was happening is that
although the voltage swing of the two photodiode channels is not that
much worse than with the SP-117 laser head, the actual voltages on each
of the photodiode channels is much lower.  While for the 088-2 tube,
a typical voltage swing is from 2 or 3 V to 5 or 6 V, for the 088, it
is from 0.1 or 0.2 V to 2 or 3 V.  Since the 088 is a lower power tube, there
are probably only 2 modes maximum and the polarization extinction ratio
is much higher than for the 088-2.  So, the controller may be looking for
the signals to be within a specific absolute voltage range, or may not
like the lock being at one extreme of the range.  This, too,
is almost certainly something that an adjustment would remedy.
But, installing a 1.5K ohm resistor across each of the photodiodes added
an offset of about 2.5 V so that the voltage swing became 2.5 to 5 V.
This was sufficient to keep the system happy.  After the normal warmup period,
the Stabilized indicator flashed a couple of times and my mode meter
stopped nearly abruptly at dead-center.  The laser was stabilized with
the two modes of nearly equal amplitude, which is the desired outcome.
In fact, there was less flashing of the Stabilized indicator before
lock than with either of the genuine SP-117 laser heads, and it
then stayed lit continuously.  That's a good thing.  Else, I would
have had to just tape a Day-Glow red dot over the Stabilized indicator. :-)
<p>
I don't know for sure why the 1.5K ohm resistors produced the desired effect.
Based on the design of the SP-117 photodiode preamps, it probably the result
of the offset voltage of the two op-amps, and thus might not work in general.
However, it would be simple to introduce the needed current in some other
way if needed.
<p>
Next, I decided to build the simplest controller possible.
In fact, the initial version constructed on a protoboard consisted of
literally five (5) parts - 1 op-amp, 2 resistors, 1 zener diode, and
1 MJE3055T transistor.  See
<A HREF="sghs1sch.pdf">Sam's Stabilized HeNe Laser 1 (SG-HS1)</A>.
The power input is 12 VDC.  And, if a dual power
supply (e.g., +/-6 VDC) were used, the zener and 1 resistor could have
been eliminated, so 3 parts. :)  OK, these simple implementations won't
switch from constant heat mode to feedback mode automatically - there's
a switch for that but the switch doesn't count as an essential part since
it could be done by moving a wire! :)  Locking was very stable with minimal
overshoot.  Grab the tube or block the waste beam to the photodiodes to
force it to lose lock and when restored to normal, it will stabilize very
quickly.  In fact, the first time I completed the feedback loop, I thought
that something was wrong when it settled down almost immediately.
<p>
The soldered refined version has a few more parts to implement
PI (Proportional-Integral) control.  It is shown in
<A HREF="sghs2sch.pdf">Sam's Stabilized HeNe Laser 2 (SG-HS2)</A>.
The "I" in PI control eliminates the
offset error of the stable point resulting from the finite gain of the
error amplifier which would change depending on the temperature of the
tube and thus heater current.  A pot to move the stable point over about
90 percent of the gain curve, a tuning input, and LEDs to show the relative
intensities of the modes were also added.  The LEDs also serve to show when
the laser has locked, and roughly where on the gain curve it is sitting.
There are now a grand total of 29 parts, but more than two thirds of them
are for the non-essential bells and whistles. :)  The only change that may
needed to allow it to be used with any SP-117 compatible laser head would
be to make the gain of the error amp adjustable but I didn't have any
suitable pots handy.
<p>
SG-HS2 seems to work every bit as well as the SP-117 controller and perhaps
better, at least based on general behavior.  Admittedly, I haven't measured
the frequency stability.  Certainly, additional filtering and shielding
would be needed to truly achieve similar noise specifications.
But for now, this will have to do
And, the entire circuit fits on a little piece of perf. board (overall
dimensions less than 2x3 inches).  See <A HREF="sg117s2.jpg">Photo of
Sam's SP-117 Compatible Stabilized HeNe Laser Head and Controller</A>.
Yes, it's that little thing in the lower left corner!  The
power supply for the HeNe laser and the 12 VDC power supply for
the controller are not shown, but that's all.  Really! :)  After
the photo was taken, I couldn't resist adding a green LED for power, a
yellow LED showing the approximate heater voltage (by its intensity), and
a test connector with the mode difference signal (U1-1), the output
of the PI amp (U1-7), the heater voltage, and ground.
<p>
Determining when to switch to "Lock" is generally no problem.  Just
set it on "Preheat" and wait until a full mode cycle takes at least
20 seconds or so.  It should then stabilize in less than one additional
mode cycle and remain at a fixed locking point, with the heater voltage
nowhere near its extremes (0 V: too cold, 12 V: too hot, that LED is
a good enough measure).  For example, if the tube isn't hot enough, the
modes will continue to slowly drift away with the heater totally off,
and incapable of keeping the temperature from increasing due to the
power in the HeNe discharge.  In that case, switch back to
"Preheat" and give it a couple more minutes.  Another simple test is
to switch to "Off" from "Preheat" and watch the mode LEDs.  If it's hot
enough, the mode display will immediately change direction as the tube
cools.  If the modes don't do much of anything or continue in the same
direction, more heating is needed.  As a practical matter, once an optimal
minimum mode cycle time for switchover has been determined for a particular
laser head, waiting until it occurs should be sufficient, and is basically
what the "real" stabilized laser controllers do.  For the rig shown above,
it takes about 12 minutes in my approximately 65 &deg;F seasonally adjusted
lab.  Or, count full mode cycles - about 72 after 12 minutes.  You're welcome
to add the logic if desired. :)  Or, just wait a looooong time. :)  Then
the tube will reach thermal equilibrium but the heater is only driven
at about 1/2 power in Preheat, so there will be ample head and foot room
once switched to Lock
<p>
I have tested SG-HS2 with a genuine SP-117 laser head.  The required warmup
time is even shorter - less than 10 minutes.  I'm not quite sure why that
should be the case since the heater resistance (and thus power disspation)
is similar).  Possibly, it's due to the tube being enclosed by the head
cylinder which provide thermal insulation.  It would certainly be beneficial
to enclose the tube in such a cylinder or other semi-insulating jacket to
isolate it from air currents and other thermal disturbances.
<p>
SG-HS2 should drive a Melles Griot 05-STP-901 laser head with no changes
(except maybe for gain as discussed above) since that stabilized laser is
the same as an SP-117A.  Adapting it to a Coherent 200 laser head may
require minor changes (aside from connectors and such).  I have not measured
the maximum heater voltage required for that laser but suspect it is higher
than 12 V because the laser head cylinder heats up more quickly and
stabililizes at a much higher case temperature than the SP-117 even though
the heater resistance is similar.  The integrator time constant may also
need tweaking.
<p>
So, who needs to pay $5,000 for a stablized HeNe laser.  Aside from the
cost of the HeNe laser tube, its power supply, and some sort of polarizing
beamsplitter, this entire rig would cost nothing to build for anyone with
a reasonably well stocked electronics junk drawer.  And, for a laser jock,
those other items will be in their junk drawer as well. :)
<p>
In additional to the stabilized HeNe laser, this basic circuit and ones
like it have many other potential applications.  For example, it could
used as a fringe locker with a pair of photodiodes in quadrature sensing
the interference pattern from a laser diode and using thermal control to
adjust its wavelength.
<p>
Blank PCBs as well as a complete kit of parts are now available for
SGHS2. The PCB is just under 2x1.8 inches as shown in
<A HREF="sghs2p1.jpg">Photo of Sam's Stabilized HeNe Laser Controller 2</A>
It has a DB9F for the laser head (SP-117/A compatible), 3 pin header
for power, and 2 pin header for modulation.  Power requirements are
regulated +12 VDC at 1 A.  SGHS2 may be used as shown, or built
into a project box with front panel controls in place of the switch and
trimpots.  For more info, please go to

<h3><A NAME="chnsvssl">Sam's Very Simple Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

I have now built a minimalist laser head using the single mode approach
that runs from my SP-117 compatible controller.
It uses a 6 inch barcode scanner tube with a single photodiode
behind a polarizing filter stuck on the HR mirror mount.  An adhesive dot
painted black with a hole was stuck on the HR mirror to block bore light.
The heater is approximately 50 feet of #36 AWG magnet wire wound
bifilar-style over an aluminum wrap.  The tuning pot on the controller
is used to set the locking amplitude.
<p>
While locking was successful on the initial attempt after preheat,
it only remained stable for a minute or so and then fliped
polarizations and cycling through one set of modes before reacquiring
lock.  And then this cycle repeated continuously.  So, this tube has
turned into a flipper.  Perhaps, I didn't test it thoroughly enough.
I thought that perhaps, there were still some back-reflections that
needed to be tamed given that the photodiode is so close to the HR
mirrir.  But even when the tube was allowed to warm up on its
own without anything near the HR mirror, it still occasionally flipped,
though not as consistently as is the case when the feedback loop is enabled.
<p>
I have now checked out several other 6 inch tubes both for non-flipping
mode behavior and acceptable power in the waste beam.  I found another tube
that flips *all the time*.  The power in one mode climbs smoothly until
about two thirds of the maximum and then abruptly drops to zero.  That mode
looks like a sawtooth. :)  But most tubes seem well
behaved.  Of the dozen or so tested, I've identified 5 that seem to be
flip-free and have enough power in the waste beam to be usable without
needing to increase the photodiode gain on my controller.
<p>
Installing a heater on one of the well behaved tubes eliminated the flipping
problem.  The laser now stabilizes easily and remains locked continuously,
though the feedback loop is a bit underdamped if disturbed, possibly since
the same wattage heater was used on a much smaller tube.  This would be
unimportant if the tube were installed inside some sort of enclosure to
provide isolation from air currents - to which is is <i>very</i> sensitive.
I may mount it in the cylinder from an 05-LHR-911 laser head, inside of
which it should fit easily.  I'll keep the original tube and heater
assembly intact as an example of one not to use.
<p>
Then I discovered another issue: This tube has waste beam power that varies
by almost 2:1 depending on the temperature.  Once everything reaches
equilibrium, this may not be that critical.  But as it warms up even after
locking, the output power can be seen to drift significantly even though
the photodiode voltage is rock solid.  Based on tests of other tubes with
similar behavior, my conclusion is that the HR mirror was ground
without wedge and is suffering from etalon effects.  A change in effective
reflectivity of only 0.03 percent would change the waste beam power
by about 30 &micro;W.  For more on this phenomenon, see the sections starting
with: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmgyl2">Melles Griot Yellow Laser Head With
Variable Output</A>.  Such variation wouldn't be quite as critical for two
mode ratio stabilization, but for one mode intensity stabilization, the
output power ends up inversely tracking the changes in waste beam power.
So, it would be better to sample the output beam for the feedback.
<p>
So, I checked out the remaining tubes that had a well behaved mode sweep and
found two others that had a minimal change in relative waste beam and output
beam power from cold to hot (beyond that during normal operation).
(I only checked those two, so it's possible I just got really unlucky
with the bad one.)  There is probably still some change but it is down
near the limit of detectability watching a pair of laser power meters
with the tube doing its mode sweep thing and the readings varying.
(Recording the power of both beams as a plot would have been better.)
Instead of almost a 2:1 change, it's more like +/-1 percent.  But, this
is still much greater than I would have expected before undertaking
this exercise, since it never occurred to me to even check for such a
problem, um, "feature", in a normal red HeNe laser.  Using this tube
results in much better performance with only a small drift after locking
until thermal equilization is complete.  When stuffed into the cylinder
from an 05-LHR-911 laser head without end-caps, the short term stability
is about +/-0.5 percent.  If carefully packaged, it would probably be
much better.
<p>
But, locking to a specific amplitude is more finicky all around than locking to
a 1:1 ratio, which can be set and forgotten. :)  So, this further suggests
that the additional complexity of a polarizing beamsplitter and two
photodiodes is well worth it unless the goal is intensity stabilization.
And, sampling the output beam is also probably a better idea unless the
tube is known to have very consistent waste beam and output beam power.

<h3><A NAME="chnslssl">Sam's Simplest Stabilized Laser Controllers</A></h3>

Would you believe two (2) electronic components in addition to the mode
sampling photodiode and heater?  Yes, it's true.  This controller consists
of a high value resistor and BUZ71 or similar N-channel MOSFET, and runs
on 8 to 12 VDC.  That's it!  This is so simple that a diagram is almost
not worth drawing:

<p>
A silicon photodiode is reverse biased from the positive power supply
to the resistor.  Select the resistor value so that the voltage to the
MOSFET varies near ground to near V+.  The exact value will depend on the
power in the waste beam from the laser tube and the details of the
polarizing beam sampler.  The junction of the PD and resistor is
attached to the gate of the MOSFET.  The heater (10 to 20 ohms
recommended) sits between the drain of the MOSFET and positive
power; the source is grounded.
<p>
To operate, run the laser tube from its power supply and run the heater
from the controller power supply direct until the tube is hot enough
such that removing heater power causes the modes to reverse direction.
As usual, this takes 10 to 20 minutes.  Then allow the MOSFET to take
control. :)
<p>
Of course, since this uses only one of the two polarized modes, it is an
intensity, not frequency stabilized laser, and only for the mode that is
sampled.  There are no guarantees on performance other than that it will
lock and remain locked to a specific mode.  Since the feedback loop is
proportional only (no integrator) with the gain provided by the resistor
value and MOSFET transconductance, don't expect quite the same
specifications as the SP-117A.  However, it will still be
a couple orders of magnitude more stable than a common HeNe laser, and
will be single frequency like the others.

Victor Zhao, a high school student working at the
<A HREF="http://laser.physics.sunysb.edu/">Laser Teaching Center at
Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY</A> during the summer of 2008,
and I actually built a stabilized laser based on this circuit in about
1 hour total.  Most of that time was spent in Victor practicing his soldering
skills and scrounging up a suitable MOSFET from another lab.  But despite the
MOSFET simply dangling in mid-air by its wires, the thing locked on the
first attempt!  I really need to dig up that photo.  It's a classic! :)
(I did later explain about the importance of heatsinks, but MOSFETS are tough.)
Victor went on to achieve semifinalist status in the Intel Talent Search
competition based on his subsequent work with stabilized HeNe lasers.
More on Victor including the Intel paper at

<p>
For better performance, use both polarizations with 2 photodiodes and
2 resistors.  (That's 3 parts instead of 2 parts!)  And perhaps make one
of the resistors adjsutable to set the stable point on the neon gain curve.
The PDs should be in series reverse biased from the positive
supply to ground and the resistors should also be in series to ground.
The center taps of the PDs and resistors should be connected together
and to the gate of the MOSFET.  Getting this scheme
to work is left as an exercise for the student! :)

<h3><A NAME="chnslarb">Sam's Laseangle RB-1 Stabilized HeNe laser Conversion</A></h3>

Laseangle was a company that built some stabilized HeNe lasers in the
early 1980s.  I don't know if they ever actually sold anything commercially
but there is a reference in a paper to the use of 6 of their
systems.  Perhaps, the researchers were related to the company founder. :)
<p>
I was given what must have been a prototype or testbed - the RB-1.
The RB-1 consisted of two pieces as shown in <A HREF="larb1p1.jpg">Laseangle
RB-1 Stabilized HeNe Laser Head and Controller</A>.  The connecting cables
were nowhere to be found when these photos were taken.  The
laser head is SN# 1 and and the controller is SN# 2, so at least two of
these systems were built.  The thing clearly wouldn't be caught dead
going out to a paying customer, though it's likely that the RB-1
or its successor eventually morphed into the Newport NL-1 (maybe "Newport
Laseangle 1"?) as a result of a merger or buy-out.  However, I've yet to
see an actual NL-1 (or production RB-1 if there ever was such a thing).
<p>
The RB-1 laser head contained the HeNe laser tube, with
wrap-around heater, a beam sampler assembly that diverted all of one
polarization to a photodiode and part of the orthogonal polarization to
another photodiode, and preamps for the photodiodes.  The base is
a 3/4 inch thick aluminum slab with a 1/8 inch aluminum cover sealed
with foam rubber.
<p>
The controller housed what appears to be a standard Laser Drive HeNe
laser power supply brick, DC power supply, feedback circuitry, and
heater driver.  There were controls on the front clearly not for an
end-user, like 8 or 10 gain settings and a fine gain control for one
of the op-amps, selection of which mode signal to pass to an output, a
current meter for the heater, and so forth.  People who typically use
these things would have no clue of what to do with the knobs and switches.
But I've yet to see a user manual!
<p>
While the mounting of the HeNe laser tube is somewhat overkill and the
beam sampler is a nice solid unit with an adequate number of adjustments,
the electronic construction of both the laser head and controller are,
to put it politely, a disaster.  Everything is on those copper strip
prototyping boards, with capacitor upon capacitor added in various
places no doubt to tame noise pickup or instability.  (Someone must have
had stock in a capacitor company!)  The designers must
have had a goal of using strange and hard to find connectors wherever
possible which they did for the separate cables of the photodiode signals
(blue multipin) and heater drive (microphone two pin).   Power for the
HeNe laser tube came from a standard Alden on the controller but at the
laser head had both the medium voltage BNC on top for the
positive and the normal BNC on the bottom for the negative.  Someone must have
been toasting marshmallows above the DC power supply voltage regulators
since there is a nice brown spot on the ventilation grill there.  I
have no intention of powering up either the controller or the entire
laser since the cables with their strange connectors are nowhere to
be found, it's not worth constructing replacements, and the thing
would probably explode in any case.
<p>
My mission was to convert the laser head alone into a basic self-contained
stabilized HeNe laser suitable to use to demonstrate a simple stabilized
HeNe laser.  It will be donated to a university Physics Demonstration
facility.
<p>
The original HeNe laser tube was from Uniphase, a garden variety model
but was end-of-life - hard start, hard run, white-ish discharge color,
and only about 0.4 mW of output (probably should have been around 2 mW).
Its length of 8 inches is somewhat unusual - 6 or 9.5 inches being more
common, at least today.  While a 9.5 inch tube would satisfy the criteria
for the number of modes, it would just barely fit, but with marginal
clearance for the high voltage on its anode mirror mount.  So, I installed
one of the 6 inch tubes I'd already selected for well behaved mode sweep
behavior.  The beam sampler uses the main beam, so any variation in waste
beam power is more or less irrelevant.
<p>
The original beam sampler included a polarizing beamsplitter cube to extract
one of the mode signals and prevent it from reaching the output at all,
and a separate angled plate to extract a portion of the orthogonal mode.
A pair of EG&G SGD-100A photodiodes (may be similar to the Perkin Elmer
FFD-100) fed LF356 op-amps.
<p>
Of all this, only the angled plate and the mounting hardware for all the beam
sampler stuff was retained.  I wanted the beamsplitter cube for other
uses but also needed to roughly equalize the power to the 2 photodiode
channels to keep the new controller happy.  (Single mode locking would
probably have satisfied the design goals but it would only take a bit
more effort to use both modes.)  So, in place of the
beamsplitter cube, I built a little angled mounting post and added a
bit of an optical window to act as a plate beamsplitter.  In place of
the EG&G photodiodes which were too nice to use here, I installed a
pair of my normal $2 photodiodes - which also have a larger area
making them easier to align with the sampled beams.  A red filter was
glued in the beam path in front of each photodiode to block bore
light.  These were left in place.  A piece of Polaroid polarizing film
was cut to fit in front of each photodiode to select the orthogonal modes.
Some experimentation showed that one set of orientations resulted in
approximately equal power in the orthogonal polarizations to each
photodiode - within 20 percent - which would be good enough.  For
the other possibility, they differed by perhaps 2:1.
<p>
The new controller was constructed on a piece of perf. board to fit in
about the same space as the original preamp.  The rear panel of the laser
head was modified to have a power switch, Preheat/Off/Lock switch, LEDs for
the heater (yellow) and the two modes (red and green), the Offset pot, and
a Tuning input BNC (more to fill the existing hole than to be something
essential!).  The original connector on the front of the laser head was
left in place just in case someone would want to monitor various signals
(though I have no intention of wiring anything to it at the present time).
The orignal controller came in handy though.  Its rubber feet were
transferred to the converted laser head. :-)
<p>
The HeNe laser power supply is one of those little copper covered bricks
made by Laser Drive for a variety of barcode scanners.  It easily fits
on the baseplate behind the laser tube.  The system runs from 12 VDC at
about 1.5 A max.  A 2 amp fuse (in a socket) was included for good measure.
These little plug-in fuses were about the only thing worth salvaging
from the mainboards of Sparc-II workstations. :)
<p>
Views of the completed unit are shown in <A HREF="larbcp1.jpg">Laseangle
RB-1 Stabilized HeNe Laser Conversion Rear Panel</A> and
<A HREF="larbcp2.jpg">Laseangle RB-1 Stabilized HeNe Laser
Conversion Interior</A>.  Some labeling of the rear panel will
be needed.  Inside, the HeNe laser power supply is on the left next
to the tube with its heater.  The large black object is the
modified beam sampler assembly with the red and green dots indicating
which section is associated with the vertical (green) and horizontal
(red) polarization modes.  The controller is on the elongated perf.
board with heatsink.  The bare blue connector is left as an exercise
for the student (or professor) to provide for signal monitoring.
<p>
The system now works like the one described in the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnh117s">Sam's Home-Built SP-117 Compatible
HeNe Laser</A>.  After a 10 minute preheat period, it locks easily and
will clearly be able to demonstrate the basics of a two mode
stabilized HeNe laser.  The control loop is a bit underdamped,
probably because of the smaller thermal mass of the 6 inch tube.  The
wrap-around heater, originally used with the RB-1, is also slightly
higher power.  But if the user wants to play with the gain of the
integrator, its proportional feedback resistor is in a socket (no pots
in the entire thing).  I just picked the first one that seemed
reasonable.  I make no guarantees on frequency drift or noise, but
with the cover in place, the amplitude of either polarized mode settles
down after a couple of minutes to a short term variation of less than
+/-0.25 percent.  Since it's locking on the mode ratio, the frequency
variation this corresponds to should be quite respectable, probably
less than +/-2 MHz.  This is better than 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>!
<p>
I assume that the ugly cover will be replaced with clear Plexiglas. ;-)
<p>

Laseangle 1") can be found at

<h3><A NAME="chndzees">Two-Frequency HeNe Lasers Based on Zeeman
 Splitting</A></h3>

I originally got interested in doing this because I had acquired the HeNe
laser tube for the HP-5501 interferometer.  This is a "two-frequency laser"
which generates a beat signal (in a photodetector) between 1 and 2 MHz using
Zeeman splitting.  I had also acquired the reference detector PCB for an
HP-5517 interferometer which is a very similar instrument.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstish3">Hewlett-Packard/Agilent
Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A> for more information.
<p>
The HP-5501 laser tube is easily powered with a small HeNe "brick" for a
1 to 2 mW laser.  The optimal current is between 3.0 and 3.5 mA.  The
connections are positive (with ballast resistor) to the terminal near the
output lens, negative to the terminal on the side of the big glass bulb,
and no connection to the terminal at the end which is a piezo for controlling
cavity length.  Using that for the negative connection
may result in damage to the tube.  The HP-5501 tube is constructed with a very
stable resonator structure having an ultra-thick cylinder with a small
bore and ends that are precision ground for the mirrors, which are held in
place by springs (!!) - no adjustment possible other than for cavity length
via the piezo element at the cathode-end.  That cylinder is made of Zerodur,
a special very low thermal expansion coeffient glass/ceramic developed by the
<A HREF="http://www.us.schott.com/english/">Schott Glass</A>.  In fact,
longitudinal mode cycling present with normal HeNe lasers is virtually
non-existent in the 5501A.  A stack of ALNICO ring magnets
similar to magnetron magnets (though not quite as powerful) surround the tube
covering about 2/3rds of the bore but not the whole length - the discharge
can be seen at both ends.  Aside from the huge solid cathode and funny
construction, the tube is otherwise unremarkable as a HeNe laser goes.
The output is less than 0.5 mW and there are ghost reflections/interference
from the slightly tilted non-AR coated outer glass window through which the
beam emerges.
<p>
The HP-5501 tube is mounted inside the magnet assembly using a combination
of RTV silicone and black rubbery stuff.  It is possible to get it out
non-destructively by removing the magnet retainer/mounting bracket at the
output-end and then picking away at the adhesive/sealer pulling off magnets
as they become free (protect the fragile tube) and then finally the bracket
at the HR end.  However, it's best to leave the tube snuggly in place to
maintain alignment with the output optics.  A photo is shown in
<A HREF="hp5501at.jpg">HP-5501A Laser Tube Removed From Magnet and
Output Optics Assembly</A>.
<p>
Someone had sent me a partial schematic of the reference PCB so I was able
to determine where to connect power and take the signal output.  After
confirming that it did respond to a laser pointer, I powered up the HP-5501
tube and immediately got a nice beat signal on my scope of around
1.5 MHz - the difference in energy levels which translates to a difference
in frequency caused by Zeeman splitting via the large cylindrical magnet
surrounding the tube bore.
<p>
But, for some as yet to be determined reason,
when I went to reconnect it after doing the experiments below, I could not
get any beating unless the gain of the detector was turned all the way up
and there was no polarizer in the beam.  And even then it was very noisy
turning on and off at a 20 KHz or so rate.  The laser appears to work fine
otherwise.  Then, after sitting on the shelf for about 6 months after this,
I fired it up and immediately got a strong 1.9 MHz beat and it has
continued to operate perfectly.  Go figure. :)
I still have not resolved this mystery.  As far as I can determine, there
isn't anything that is different to account for either its change of heart
about cooperating or the much higher beat frequency.  Now this tube
was a reject.  From later experiments, I have determined that
the PZT on this tube doesn't work.  But I have no idea how that
would account for the inconsistent behvior.
<p>
However, since it decided to start working again, I had the opportunity
to put a voltage on the mystery terminal at the rear of the tube.  Previous
attempt to get any effect from this were inconclusive.  This time, I used
delayed sweep on the scope to increase the sensitivity to frequency changes
and was able to detect a very small effect when varying the voltage from 0
to 30 VDC or so - probably less than 1 percent.  However, it wasn't
instantaneous as would be expected but appeared to lag behind the voltage
change.  Since this is inconsistent with the normal behavior of a piezo
driver, there is still somewhat of a mystery as to what is inside.
<p>
I obtained a really old HP-5500C laser, (which uses the same tube) to analyze.
The driver is just a voltage controlled high voltage power supply module
and the labeling on the printed circuit board is "PZT"!  It runs on 15 VDC
and provides 0 to 1.5 kV when fed a control voltage of 0 to 15 V relative
to the negative input.  The power supply for the HeNe laser tube itself is just
a potted brick that runs on 15 VDC but it does have an enable input which
must be tied to the positive input to turn it on.  (In looking back on this
referring to the HP-5501A schematic which I assume to be similar, it may
not be an enable but a current control input.)  In the HP-5500C, both
these power supplies (no model or manafacturer available) run on the -15 VDC
power supply so plus is actually ground.  And, the wire color coding is
confusing: Pink/red is -15 and black is ground.
<p>
I also have an HP-5501A
laser head and on this one, the HeNe laser power supply also runs on the
-15 VDC supply, negative is violet and black is ground.  There is a white/green
control wire that appears to be driven to +15 VDC to turn on the laser
but the circuitry isn't just a simple interlock.  Applying power to the laser
head is all that is required to turn on the laser and get it to "Tune" (as HP
calls it) to the proper conditions for stable two-frequency operation.
<p>
Another sample of the bare tube I obtained on eBay was comatose on arrival
(lit up but no output).  However, it came back to life over the course of
about 12 hours.  I wouldn't have expected soft-seal behavior from this very
high quality hard-seal tube but it had been sitting on someone's shelf for
over 15 years!  There is no obvious getter so perhaps the cause was just
slight outgassing of internal parts over this time period.  Without being
run periodically to clean it up, the result was enough contamination to
prevent lasing.
<p>
Anyone can take a commercial two-frequency laser tube and make it work.  So,
that's pretty boring. :)
<p>
To see what I could do with a common HeNe laser tube, I dug up a typical
1 mW, 6 inch randomly polarized barcode scanner tube and connected it to the
same brick power supply.  Without any magnet, there was still a signal from
the detector.  It was varying widely in frequency as the tube heated, no doubt
a byproduct of mode cycling.  In actuality, this was due to the stray magnetic
field of the HP tube which wasn't far away.  With no magnetic field present,
there were no detectable beats, as expected.  (Where more than one
longitudinal mode is present, there would be beats at a frequency determined
by the mode spacing, c/(2*L), but this is about 1 GHz for these 6 inch tubes
and not detectable by any equipment I have available.  For multi-transverse
mode tubes, there would also be beats at much lower frequencies but all these
HeNe barcode scanner tubes operate TEM00.)  The effect of the magnetic
field was confirmed by moving a magnet in the vicinity of the
tube which would generate all sorts of variable frequency beats with
detectable effects as far as a foot or more away from the tube.
Hey, could this be used to create a new sort of musical instrument - a
laser based successor to the Theremin for the new millenia? :)  If so,
I declare first disclosure for patent purposes. :)
<p>
Anyhow, to create a true Zeeman split two-frequency laser, I installed the
HeNe laser tube inside a fairly powerful cylindrical magnet.  If
the tube would have fit inside magnetron ring magnets, I would have used
a stack of them but this tube is a bit too wide.  So, I used a magnet
assembly that was supposedly for "flavoring" wine by placing the neck
of a bottle of wine in the hole in the magnet and pouring the wine
through the magnetic field - each polarity for two possible flavors.
Yeah, right. :)  I picked it up at a garage sale for 50 cents simply
because the magnets seemed nice and powerful.  The length of the
magnet assembly was about 2 inches.  I initially centered the tube
in the magnet and used a bit of packing to keep it secure.  A diagram of this
rig is shown in: <A HREF="twofreq1.gif">Demonstration of Two-Frequency
HeNe Laser Using Zeeman Splitting</A>.
<p>
A polarizer (Polaroid sheet) was needed to obtain a consistent signal.
Without a polarizer in the output beam, it was almost impossible to get
any response on the oscilloscope though with careful adjustment of the
beam position (and presumably intensity on the detector), a weak and
somewhat unstable beat could be found.  However, when a polarizer was
added, there was a very strong beat signal almost continuously - at
times more than 25% of the average power when measured with an analog
(continuous) sensor.  The orientation of the polarizer didn't appear to
matter at all, just that it be present.  (I did confirm that
this wasn't simply a matter of needing some attenuation to stay within
the dynamic range of the sensor.)   And, any polarization preference
the tube may have had totally disappeared once the tube was installed
in the magnet.  This implies that the polarization is no longer linear and
probably consists of two circularly polarized beams with the Zeeman split
frequency difference for each oscillating mode (based on the quantum
mechanical properties of isolated gas atoms in a constant axial magnetic
field).  Mode cycling of the HeNe tube as it heated resulted in a periodic
instability or momentary loss of signal.
<p>
The result was similar to the behavior of the commercial two-frequency laser
except for instability at times as it warmed up.  Depending on the position of
the magnet, the frequency could be varied from about 500 kHz to over 1 MHz with
the highest frequency produced when the magnet was closest to the anode-end
of the tube.  An explanation for the frequency's dependence on position is
that locating the magnet closer to the anode-end of the tube puts more
of the magnetic field inside the short bore.  The frequency still varied
cyclicly by 10 percent or so as the tube heated due to mode competition.
With a single magnet (about 1/2" thick) near the cathode, the weak field
behavior could be produced with the beat frequency varying from DC to a
few hundred kHz based on mode cycling.
<p>
The beat frequency is about 1/3 to 2/3 that of the HP tube, which might be
accounted for by a proportionally lower magnetic field compared to that
assembly.  However, in testing various tubes (see below), identical model
tubes in identical positions resulted in a wide variation of beat
frequencies.  Even repeating what I thought were identical experiments
at different times resulted in widely varying results so there's more going
on than can be accounted for by the simple explanations of Zeeman split
two-frequency lasers I've found so far.
<p>
I seem to have lucked out with the first tube I tried and have now tested a
few others.  It would appear that for best stability in beat frequency, the
tube should be a "flipper" - one that oscillates single (longitudinal) mode
at one polarization and then abruptly switches polarization but still remains
single mode as the modes cycle during warmup.  It could be that flippers
are more symmetric without or something.  When more than one mode is
oscillating as with most non-flippers where modes gradually come and go,
the beating is not a clean waveform but a superposition of beating of the
two (or more) modes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Uniphase 6 inch "flipper".  These tubes seem to work best with good
 stability and a relatively narrow range of frequencies (10 percent or so).
 Thay have a nice clean waveform most of the time with momentary instability
 only when the modes flip.
<p>
<li>Siemens 6 inch "non-flipper".  These tubes have unstable
 beat patterns most of the time.  The beat frequency can vary by more than
 2:1 as the modes cycle but this is really due to the mixing of the two
 beat notes.  They probably never operate entirely single mode.
<p>
<li>Melles Griot 5 inch.  One sample I installed in a stack of 4 magnetron
 magnets (thickness about 2").  Behavior is similar to that of the Siemens
 tubes, above.  Another similar tube had characteristics more like that of the
 Uniphase tube.  However, with a stack of 6 magnets providing a nearly uniform
 field over the entire bore, I could detect absolutely *no* beating within the
 bandwidth of my detectors (at least to 2 MHz) for either tube.
<p>
<li>Uniphase 6 inch non-flipper.  This is the well behaved tube described
 in the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsvssl">Sam's Very Simple
 Stabilized HeNe Laser</A> and was installed in the magnet/waveplate
 assembly from an HP-5501A laser.  Slightly cheating, I know. :)  It
 produced a beat frequency over about 1/2 the mode sweep cycle that was
 varied between about 1.29 and 1.35 MHz, similar to a real 5501A.
</ul>
<p>
It is quite straightforward to further stabilize this rig with a
heater and temperature feedback to control cavity length.  This should
result in a system which produces a clean and highly stable signal
with specs similar to commercial units.  As a qick experiment, I did
just that with the last tube in the HP-5501A magnet/waveplate assembly.
The feedback had to use the
output rather than the waste beam since only there are
the Zeeman modes converted to linear polarized modes.  So, an additional
non-polarizating beamsplitter was needed so that the output beam could
also be input to an optical receiver for display on a frequency counter
and oscilloscope.  The waveplates were adjusted
as best I could by feel so the Zeeman modes were linearly polarized and
orthogonal at the output.  Baiscally, this was trial and error until the
amplitude of the mode changes seemed to be a maximum and balanced.
Stabiilzation was then trivial using the controller described in the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnh117s">Sam's Home-Built SP-117 Compatible HeNe
Laser</A>.  The tuning knob could then be used to adjust the frequency.
As a practical matter, almost any waveplate orientations would
result in enough mode variation for locking, but the maximum tuning
range required reasonably balanced modes.  There's no doubt that this
will also work with any of the other non-HP magnets, but then the 1/4
and 1/2 waveplates would need to be added.
<p>
However, there's one strange characteristic of this setup compared to a
"real" HP Zeeman laser: With the 5501A and 5517C that I've checked, when
the beat frequency is present, the actual frequency is a <i>maximum</i> when
the modes are equal, then gradually goes down on either side and abruptly
disappears.  With the "Frankenstein" laser, the beat frequency is a
<i>minimum</i> when the modes are equal.  The only obvious difference
would seem to be that the cavity length is a bit shorter - around 5-1/2
inches compared to between 6 and 6-1/2 inches.  But there are many other
parameters that might be significant.  For example, it could be a
different gas fill ratio or the use of pure isotopic He and/or Ne.
Interesting.  Just when I thought I had an idea of how this works,
another mystery! :)  
<p>
However, it's possible that I had the phase of the feedback reversed so
it was locking on the opposite slopes of the gain curves.  If this tube
produced a beat signal for the entire mode sweep cycle as some do with
modest magnetic fields, then it might lock either way, but would end
up at the wrong place.  Where the beat only appears for part of the
mode sweep cycle, it could still lock at the wrong place, but then
there would be no beat.
<p>
Using an electromagnetic solenoid instead of the
permanent magnet for these experiments would permit dynamic control the
beat frequency.  In fact, a phase locked loop (PLL) could be used to lock
the output to a reference oscillator.  Since even with a permanent magnet,
the beat frequency varies slightly with the position of the mode on the
gain curve, once the range is known, phase-locking to a reference
frequency would result in a highly stabilized laser.  Though, depending
on application, stablizing the mode position on the gain curve may be
more desirable.  The latter is what is done in all the HP/Agilent
metrology lasers.
<p>
I leave this and countless other variations as exercises for the student. :)
<p>
<b>U.S. Patent #4,672,618: Laser Stabilization Servo System</b> provides a good
introduction to the HeNe two-frequency laser and discusses techniques for
stabilization with some references.  This would be a good starting point
free of too much hairy math. :)
<p>
More on the theory behind the axial Zeeman-split two-frequency HeNe laser
can be found in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstish3">Hewlett-Packard/Agilent Stabilized
HeNe Lasers</A>.  Don't
worry, no hairy math. :)  And the explanation for why the beat only
appears for a portion of the mode sweep cycle is explained there.  Also
included are some plots of the Zeeman mode cycle behavior with warmup
and how it relates to the Zeeman-split neon gain curves.

<h4><A NAME="chntfilt">Two-Frequency Interferometer Laser Tester</A></h4>

There were a couple of motivations for building this.  I wanted to confirm
that the horizontally polarized component of the beam was actually the lower
frequency, F1, for the HP-5517 lasers.  It was.  I also wanted a way of
easily monitoring the output when replacing a tube and adjusting the
waveplates.  And most importantly, I needed an excuse to play with some
of the HP interferometer components I had accumulated! :)
<p>
The tester is a slab of butcher block (in leu of a real optical breadboard!),
an HP-10706A plane mirror interferometer, an HP-10780A optical receiver,
and a light-weight front surface mirror glued to a loudspeaker woofer
on a crude wooden kinematic mount. :)  The laser being tested is simply
placed in position where the return beam is centered on the optical
receiver and clamped in place.  Clamps sold separately. :-)
<p>
The setup is shown in <A HREF="tfiltst1.gif">Diagram of Two-Frequency
Interferometer Laser Tester</A> and the actual painted and hand-rubbed
apparatus in <A HREF="tfiltst1.jpg">Photo of Two-Frequency Interferometer
Laser Tester</A>.  The laser is a tired old HP-5517D outputting about
120 &micro;W, somewhat below the minimum HP spec of 180 &micro;W, but perfectly
usable.  The beat frequency with the mirror stationary is 3.59 MHz
for this laser.
<p>
I was concerned that the thin mirror and loudspeaker wouldn't retain the
mirror surface figure adequately flat and perpendicular to the beam axis
but that doesn't seem to be an issue if there is enough laser power.  So,
in-spec lasers work fine.  But the tired worn laser required around
20 minutes or so after locking for there to be a stable correct
beat frequency through the interferometer, though it was always correct
directly out of the laser (or at least much sooner).  Before then, the
detected frequency would gradually climb from around 700 kHz and eventually
settle in at the correct value (3.7 MHz for this laser).  That 700 kHz is
a pure amplitude modulation of the beam, as determined with a silicon
photodiode (Non-HP) detector without a polarizer.  So, it's definitely
optical and not electronic interference.  For this relatively weak laser,
the bogus signal starts out with a higher amplitude than the beat frequency
signal but gradually declines and eventually nearly disappears.  As it
does so, the beat frequency signal is detected over a larger fraction
of the time.  A signal around 700 kHz is also present with
other 5517 lasers coming and going seemingly at random and at about
the same amplitude (at least for one laser I tested).  But
since the beat frequency output was over twice that of
the weak laser, it was always high enough to not be a problem (at least
for what I was doing).  The origin turned out to be in the laser tube
itself, probably a result of plasma oscillations due to its negative
resistance having increased from use in conjunction with the excessively
long wire between the ballast resistor and tube anode.  I determined
the cause by trying another HeNe laser power supply with adjustable
current and ballast resistance.  Increasing the current by about
0.3 mA eliminated the oscillation entirely, as did adding a 10K ohm
ballast resistor spliced in close to the tube anode.  Adding anode
ballast resistance near the power supply had little effect.
A cathode ballast resistor would probably work also but is not an option
in these lasers since the cathode of the laser tube and the heater coil
for thermal tuning are electrically connected inside the tube and must
be near ground potential.  So, I installed a 20K ohm resistor an inch
from where the anode wire enters the rubbery tube potting compound.
The 20K ohm value was to be conservative.  The additional voltage drop -
about 70 V - shouldn't annoy the power supply very much as it only
represents another quarter watt.  I had originally
used the higher current power supply approach (which is the same one I use
when upgrading these lasers for chronic sputtering syndrome).  But then
went back to the standard HP supply with the additional 20K ohm ballast
resistance.
<p>
Before discovering the bogus signal and its cause, and fixing it,
I suspected the thin mirror.  So I glued another somewhat thicker
higher quality mirror on top of the original one in an effort to eliminate the
warmup problem.  (Attempting to remove and replace the thin mirror seemed
likely to damage the speaker.)  The mass is perhaps 50 percent higher but the
thing still works well enough.  That reduced the time required for
the beat frequency of the weak laser to settle down to the correct
value, probably by slightly increasing the beat frequency amplitude
relative to the 700 kHz.  But the additional ballast resistance
(or the higher tube current) totally eliminated the problem.
<p>
When driven with a sinusoidal waveform, It will easily run at 50 or 60 Hz
with sufficient amplitude to result in a 50 percent Doppler shift in
the beat frequency.  While aligning the moving mirror required some care,
it was not at all critical compared to aligning laser cavity mirrors.
Once the return beam was incident on the optical receiver, some adjustment
to center it while watching the Beam Indicator LED.  This could be further
optimized by maximizing the voltage on the "Beam Monitor" test point.
Higher laser power also results in less critical alignment.
<p>
A buffer amplifier consisting of a dual power op-amp (TDA0372) configured
for unity voltage gain was added to drive the loudspeaker since its input
impedance of 8 ohms would strain the output of the function generator.
This provides at least 5 V p-p which is more than sufficient to drive
the loudspeaker over its full range of about 6 mm (at low frequency).
The frequency counter with a 0.1 sec gate time and fast update easily shows
the frequency variation with a 1 Hz input from the function generator.
The scope is useful for both showing cleanliness of the beat frequency
waveform as well as the beat frequency percentage shift at higher
loudspeaker drive frequencies like 30 Hz.
<p>
Using a triangle wave at slow enough speed for the frequency counter
to register (2 Hz, 1/10th second gate) the offset on the forward and
reverse stroke are easily displayed.  But the loudspeaker is far from linear
over much of its range of travel!  The scope clearly shows the
period changing based on the mirror direction and velocity even at
this low speed.  At 30 Hz and moderate amplitude, the 50 percent
variation in beat frequency is quite dramatic.
<p>
And nothing has flown apart - yet. :)

<h3><A NAME="chnichlt">Installing a Common HeNe Laser Tube in an HP 5517 or 5501B</A></h3>

The original HP/Agilent HeNe laser tube used in these lasers is custom made,
rather special, and very expensive.  For more information, see the sections
starting with: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstish3">Hewlett-Packard/Agilent
Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A> and in particular:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517s">HP/Agilent 5517A/B/C/D</A>.
<p>
OK, so the first question one might ask is "Why would anyone in their right
mind want to do this?" :)  The quick answer is: "There are many HP laser
bodies out there with marginal or dead tubes but perfectly good electronics,
and these can be had for next to nothing.".  Originally, I was planning on
simply installing a conventional well behaved random polarized HeNe laser
tube with no magnet and then would have a stabilized HeNe laser for little
cost.  After all, most of the work has already been done.  It's true that the
special HP tubes have an internal heater which results in faster response,
but I doubt this would matter given the slow sampling speed of the LCD switch.
<p>
However, what may make more sense, and is actually easier in some ways,
would be to retain the magnet assembly and only replace the glass HeNe
laser tube and add an external heater.  The result would then be a fully
functional two-frequency Zeeman laser.  Even if it didn't quite meet
HP/Agilent specifications (for lifetime at least), such a laser could
be very useful for educational purposes if nothing else.  And for the
same reason people climb mountains, "because it's possible".  Well almost
the same reason! :)
<p>
My plan was to use a six inch tube like the <A HREF="uphnlt1.jpg">Typical
Uniphase HeNe Laser Tube from a Barcode Scanner</A>.  This one is from
JDS Uniphase, but Melles Griot and Siemens (now LASOS) have similar tubes,
and all are compatible with the HP/Agilent HeNe laser power supply.
The heater will consist of about 50 feet of #32 wire wound bifiler style
on the outside of the tube.  The tube+heater will be installed in place
of a dead HP 5501A tube in a 5501A magnet assembly.  And from previous
experiments, I already know that this arrangement can be stabilized
using my home-built controller.
<p>
The heater should have a cold resistance of around 8 ohms - same as most HP
lasers.  I don't know what type of wire is used in HP laser tube heaters,
but if it were copper, the set-point temperature would have to be in the
vicinity of 100 &deg;C to obtain the factor of 1.285 with respect to
cold resistance.  My heater isn't going to get that hot, so the factor
will be smaller, but hopefully the adjustment pot on the controller PCB
has enough range.  Even though the thermal response time of the Uniphase
tube with external heater will be much slower, I don't anticipate any
real problems in making this work.  Famous last words!
<p>
Well, it does work, sort of.  Preparing the laser tube was straightforward
using 50 feet of #32 wire for the heater resulted in a resistance of about
8.5 ohms.  The result is shown in
<A HREF="hprhhlt1.jpg">Replacement HP HeNe Laser Tube With Heater Using Barcode
Scanner Tube</A>.  A combination of modified pill bottles, electrical
tape, and rubber wedges were used to mount the tube inside the 5501A magnet
assembly.  It was necessary to add a negative lens to the low divergence tube
to convert it into a high divergence tube.  (This was actually the lens
originally removed from a similar tube which was required to be high
divergence in the barcode scanner.)  Otherwise, the beam diameter
at the HP beam expander was so narrow that the final beam was only about 2
mm in diameter so (1) I wasn't entirely sure it would reliably hit the
photodiodes inside the beam sampler and (2) it was difficult to align the
interferometer for a reliable signal.  In hind-sight I should have used
a high divergence tube to start.  No hig deal - the lens is held on
with a piece of plastic tubing.  With the high divergence (8 mR),
the beam is large enough at the input to the beam expander to produce
a 5 or 6 mm diameter collimated beam from the laser with most of the
power making it through.  It's still not really as wide as wouild normally
be the case with the beam expander aperture actually cutting off the
edge of the beam, but close enough for now.  Another minor glitch had
to do with feet.  Yes, feet! :)  Only one of the two base castings
on the ends of the 5501A tube magnet assembly would fit
into the 5517D case, so the casting at the other end had to be removed.
(Remarkably, though I suppose not that surprising, the hole spacing in
the castings is the same for the 5501A and 5517/5501B.)
This didn't make for the most stable arrangement in the World during
testing and adjustment, with the tube assembly balancing on one set of feet!
See <A HREF="hprtiil1.jpg">Replacement Tube Assembly Installed in 5517 Laser -
Initial</A>.  For a more permanent setup, I added spacers, nuts, and washers
so that the two base castings would be at the correct spacing for all the holes
to line up.  And, 3 Nylon screws to center the cathode-end of the tube.
(Shifting the position of the optics assembly provides adjustment at
the other end.)  See <A HREF="hprtiil2.jpg">Replacement Tube Assembly
Installed in 5517 Laser - Final</A>.  Of course, using the actual magnet
and optics in its mount from a 5501B or 5517B/C/D laser would eliminate
the mechanical issues, but I haven't taken one of those apart yet.
<p>
Here are some of the more significant issues:
<p>
<ul>
<li>I was unable to adjust the waveplates to produce clean F1 and F2
 modes.  This may simply be due to my lack of understanding of exactly
 what they should be doing, beyond the simple explanation that the
 QWP converts the circular polarized modes to linear polarized modes and
 the HWP rotates these to align with the X and Y axes.  There is more
 going on, possibly related to impure circular polarization or elliptical
 polarization from the tube and its relation to the original polarization
 axes (without the magnet).  Perhaps, it requires adjusting the waveplate
 angles -  another pair of degrees of freedom!  Yuck.
<p>
<li>There is "fuzz" in the MEAS signal when displayed on an oscilloscope.
 Although fairly clean, it's not as nice as a normal HP/Agilent laser.
 This is not present in REF from the laser though.  This could be due
 to amplitude ripple of the laser output caused by HeNe laser power
 supply ripple, appearing because of the mediocre separation of the F1
 and F2 modes, above.
<p>
<li>The locking seems to be somewhat more finicky with respect to the
 temperature setting.  It does lock initially within the 10 minutes
 allowed by the 5508A Measurement Display (after which it shows
 "Laser Fail" with no chance of recovery).  And the locking behavior
 is generally similar to that of a normal HP/Agilent 5517 laser.
 But it then loses lock once or twice over the next half hour and
 then seems to be fine, running without a glitch for the rest of
 the day.  Possibly the temperature set-point needs
 to be slightly higher.  The cold setting is 250 mV while the reading
 when locked is around 292 mV.  The temperature is related to these
 voltages, which are proportional to resistances, based on the equation:
<p>
<PRE>
             R-Ro          V-Vo
   T = To + ------ = To + ------
             Ro*k          Vo*k
</PRE>
<p>
 where k=3.9E-3 for copper with the temperatures in &deg;C.
<p>
 This corresponds to a final temperature of around 63 &deg;C sdding
 an initial temperature of 20 &deg;C.  Later I increased the setting
 to 310 mV corresponding to a set-point temperature of about 82 &deg;C.
 That seems a bit better with the startup delay to READY flashing of
 around the nominal 2 minutes and quicker time to lock with few or no
 loss-of-locks.  With either setting, once it actually settles in
 at a constant REF frequency, it remains there forever.  But what seems
 to happen is that even when it's not quite fully stabilized, the
 drift in modes is slow enough that READY is turned on solid and the REF
 output is enabled, so the 5508A Measurement Display thinks the laser is
 ready.  But it still hasn't actually fully stabilized, which takes another
 couple minutes.  So, then the 5508A produces the dreaded "Hd Error" when the
 REF is momentarily interruped.
<p>
<li>The difference frequency when locked is only about 1.2 MHz.  (Spec
 for the 5501A is 1.5 to 2.0 MHz.)  Although the 5501A magnet is being
 used, the barcode scanner tube may have a lower cavity loss compared
 to the custom HP/Agilent (5501A) tube, optimized for output power,
 not Zeeman performance.  There may also be other factors like gas fill
 isotopes and pressure.  A part of the reason may also be that the
 barcode scanner's bore is both a bit longer than the magnet and not
 quite centered within the peak magnetic field  So this is an SG-5517 -
 no A, B, C, D, E, F, or G. :)  The benefit though is that the locked
 output power is over 850 &micro;W!
</ul>
<p>
As a matter of fact, I had used the magnet assembly from a 5501A and my
SP-117/A compatible controller (see the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnh117s">Sam's Home-Built SP-117 Compatible HeNe
Laser</A>) to do something similar at lesat a year
before trying it with the 5517 chassis.  This is shown in
<A HREF="zeestab1.jpg">Two-Frequency HeNe Laser Experimental Setup 1</A>.
Now, you know what they say about sausage and how one shouldn't see how
it's made? :)  This photo is of a very raw setup with no effort made to pretty
it up.  The 6 inch laser tube with heater is driven by a HeNe laser power
supply brick, which is itself powered from a home-built 24 VDC power supply.
Since the 1/4 and 1/2 waveplates are required to separate the modes for
stabilization, there is a beam-splitter cube sitting between
the tube/magnet assembly and HP 10780A optical receiver.  It directs
part of the output beam to a polarizing beam-splitter and a pair of
photodiodes (clamped in the red vise), the same ones used with the
SP-117/A compatible controller, visible at the lower left of the
photo.  As shown, the laser has stabilized with a difference frequency
of 1.2833 MHz.
<p>
Removing the glass tube intact from a 5501B or 5517 tube assembly
that conforms to the diagram above - all those in the small case -
is the sort of thing that anyone
in their right mind would only attempt at most once, unless appropriate
noxious chemicals are available to dissolve the potting compound without
damaging anything else (except that they likely will also rot your internal
organs).  Naturally, this represented a perfect challenge!  The result is
shown in <A HREF="5517b-t2.jpg">Major Components of HP/Agilent 5517B/C/D
or 5501B Tube Assembly</A>.  It was extracted from the magnet using thin
tools, knives, and other instruments of torture to nibble away at the
potting compound between the glass tube and magnet.  This tube is actually
from a 5517B laser.  Of course, if there was no desire to save the original
glass tube, this could have been done using any technique that would work!
However, the 5501A and some very old 5501Bs have magnets in multiple
sections, so doing tube-ectomies on those isn't quite as difficult.
I did later remove the intact glass tube from a 5517D.  I'll spare you
the suspense - it appears identical to that of the 5517B in all the
physical parameters that can be determined without going inside. :)
For the 5517A, 5518A, and 5519A/B, removing the tube intact using
physical means alone is different, though perhaps not more difficult, but
an additional step is required since the outer casing needs to be removed
first.  One hand-tool approach is to slice around the casing with a
hacksaw where it narrows taking care not to go too deep, and pull off
the front part.  Then slice length-wise on opposite sides
and split the casing like a walnut.  This
allows the tube and magnet to pop out.  As you may have guessed,
a 5517A was my third intact tube-ectomy. :)
The only other instance I've heard of anyone doing this was
where a rotary tool (e.g., Dremel) with a cutoff wheel was used
to slice the outer casting AND magnet lengthwise.  Or maybe it was
a Sawzall. :)  But the hacksaw really doesn't take very long at
all to get the casing off - 10 or 15 minutes at most.  Then the fun begins
since don't want to sacrifice the magnets, even if I had something that would
cut the AlNiCo.
<p>
Next, I installed a similar 6" barcode scanner tube in the 5517B magnet.
The 5517B laser normally has a REF frequency of 1.9 to 2.4 MHz, but with the
standard tube, it produced a maximum beat frequency of only about 1.3 MHz.
Matching of the magnetic field to the active discharge region of the tube
is also critical to maximizing the REF frequency.  While this may have been
an issue with the 5501A magnet, it was quite well matched in the 5517B magnet.
So, I was about to conclude that a modified tube is essential in achieving a
higher REF frequency.  But then I had a thought: I had selected both
these 6" tubes for high output power.  Suppose I could adjust the output power
somehow, which in effect would be adjusting the cavity loss?
Two possibilities came to mind on how to do this:
(1) Run the tube on reverse polarity to cause sputtering at
the anode-end mirror (now acting as the cathode) which would increase
losses at the mirror or (2), adjust the mirror alignment to be
slightly sub-optimal.  I first tried (1) since I didn't like the idea of
installing a misaligned tube.  (Not that I liked the idea of degrading
a tube permanently any better but...)
However, all that stuff about ruining tubes
in a few minutes with reverse polarity is highly overrated, at least for
some tubes.  After 10 minutes, all that had happened was that the output
had gone up from 0.7 to over 0.9 mW.  Now, this was probably just the
normal effect of warmup, but output power was clearly not declining
precipitously as I had expected.  So I gave up before doing something I
might eventually regret.
<p>
But (2) worked very well with the following very approximately results:
<p>
<PRE>
                    Beat Frequency
    Output Power   Tube 1    Tube 2
  ------------------------------------
      1.3  mW      1.3 MHz
      0.9  mW      1.5 MHz   1.6 MHz
      0.75 mW      1.6 MHz   2.0 MHz
      0.6  mW      1.7 MHz   2.2 MHz
      0.5  mW      1.9 MHz   2.4 MHz
      0.4  mW      2.2 MHz
</PRE>
<p>
The listed Output Power is directly from the tube after appropriate mirror
misalignment.  The output power of the laser would be about 30 percent
lower due to the beam expander, waveplate, and beam sampler losses.
The Beat Frequency is the maximum value meausred during mode
sweep, which generally occurs close to where the laser would lock.
So, the tube that had an output with optimal mirror alignment that was
lower, produced a higher output power for any given beat frequency.  This is
the tube I shall use to build my SG-5517B laser. :)
<p>
Eventually, I may do some more careful measurements, but this seems to open
up a very interesting possibility: Build a single type of tube assembly
that can be tuned to the desired REF/split frequency, even after
installation.  It seems like this could certainly be varied from a
5517A to at least a 5517C, and perhaps even a 5517D, by adding a
single screw adjuster to the rear mirror mount!  It would also allow
periodic tunups to maintain the same output power and REF/split frequency
as the tube ages.
<p>
I then realigned Tube 2, above, for maximum power (whicn ended up being
about 1 mW after warmup) and
added a bracket to the cathode-end mirror mount with a screw that
applies sideways pressure to the mirror mount stem.  Since it only needs
to reduce output power, only a single screw should suffice.
This was installed in the 5517B magnet assembly shown above, whose
previous tenant had been removed.  And that was installed in the original
5517B body from which it came.  See <A HREF="hprtiil3.jpg">Replacement
Tube Assembly With Adjustable REF Frequency Installed in 5517B Laser</A> and
<A HREF="hprtiil4.jpg">Closeup of Bracket Attached to Mirror Mount to
Adjust Alignment</A>.  It is now possible to adjust this laser to meet
the REF frequency specifications for the 5517A (or 5501B), 5517B, or
5517C, while still maintaining adequate output power.  It won't make it to
a 5517D though at any useful output power, if at all.
<p>
And, I did take apart another 5517B tube/magnet/optics assembly where
the tube was known to already be physically broken.  But I couldn't
just take a wrecking ball to it because I did want the internal organs
intact - especially the mirrors for analysis.  However, that was much
quicker nonetheless.
<p>
So what does affect the Zeeman beat frequency and which of these is likely to
be used by HP/Agilent to control it?:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cavity loss:</b>  From theory, experiment, and forensic evidence :),
 we know that the Zeeman beat (REF) frequency is a strong function of the round
 trip (net) gain of the tube.  Lower mirror reflectivity, or misalignment
 will increase cavity loss and decrease the net gain.  However, this also
 affects the finesse or cold cavity linewidth: Higher mirror reflectivity
 or better alignment makes the linewidth narrower and the finesse greater.
 A narrow linewidth is "stiffer" at resisting the Zeeman-split neon gain
 curves from pulling the F1 and F2 frequency components apart.  The OC
 mirror in the tube of an HP-5517B laser has a relatively low reflectance
 of about 98.5 percent, measured on a deceased dissected one.  My
 imitation stand-in tube increases the cavity loss by misalignment, but
 its original reflectivity is already higher than that of the HP tube - 99
 percent or more, and thus its REF frequency starts out lower.
<p>
<li><b>Strength of magnetic field:</b> This should increase the REF
 frequency up to a point, but also decreases the available gain where
 the gain curves overlap, and there may also be some other more complex
 effects that hinder stable operation.  While I have not measured the
 strength of the magnets used in HP/Agilent lasers precisely, subjective
 tests do not show any dramatic differences between a 5517B and 5517D.
<p>
<li><b>Coverage of magnetic field:</b> The more or less constant portion of
 the magnetic field in genuine HP/Agilent tubes coincides with the extent
 of the bore discharge.  Conventional tubes tend to have a shorter
 discharge length relative to the overall length due to the mirror mount
 stems and tubes with a length of 6 inches or less can generally be positioned
 so the magnetic field covers the entire discharge.
<p>
<li><b>Gas composition:</b> There are two issues with the use of natural
 isotope mixtures of helium and neon: A spread out gain curve and lower
 efficiency.  The use of isotopically pure neon should result in
 a narrower neon gain curve without a magnetic field and thus a narrower
 overall (split) gain curve with a magnetic field.  This would result in
 higher gain and may also produce a higher Zeeman beat frequency for a given
 net gain and power output, as well as being able to use a longer cavity
 without risk of rogue modes (see below).  The optimal mixture would probably
 be He<sup>3</sup> and Ne<sup>20</sup> since this combination is slightly more
 efficient at transferring energy from the excited He atoms to the
 Ne atoms, increasing gain and power output.
 What is almost certain is that all HP/Agilent lasers use the same
 isotopes - either the natural mixture or pure ones.  Otherwise, the nominal
 optical frequency would differ for each model laser, and this is not
 the case.  (There was a small change in how the nominal optical frequency
 was spec'd between the 5517B and those that followed but it was only about
 14 MHz, which is not significant compared to what would result in
 switching from natural isotopes to pure ones or vice-versa.  And measurements
 of the optical frequency of actual sample lasers shows no such shift, so
 it's almost certainly an accounting change.)
<p>
<li><b>Gas pressure:</b> This, too, will have a significant effect on
 optical frequency so it's unlikely to be used even if it does affect
 Zeeman beat frequency significantly, which isn't clear.
<p>
<li><b>Cavity configuration:</b> The HP/Agilent lasers use a nearly
 hemispherical cavity.  Measurements on a dissected 5517B laser tube
 show that it has a planar HR with a 140 mm RoC OC mirror and a
 mirror spacing of 127 mm.  The bore is also stepped being narrower
 at the HR-end.  The stepped bore (as an approximation to a much more
 difficult to manufacture tapered bore) more closely matches the mode volume
 and should thus boost output power while helping to suppress higher
 order spatial modes.  And, perhaps having the gain be fully
 saturated in a portion of the discharge or the profile of the gain along
 the length of the tube relative to the magnetic field are
 beneficial in some way.  The mode sweep profile, and by inference, the
 effective gain profile, is rather strange for these tubes, and that might
 increase the Zeeman beat frequency.
<p>
<li><b>Cavity length:</b> I don't know what, if any, effect this will have
 on the Zeeman frequency.  The cavity length needs to be short enough
 to suppress rogue modes that could oscillate anywhere on the Zeeman
 split neon gain curve.  External examination of HP/Agilent laser tubes
 has been inconclusive as to whether the cavity lengths differ.  But
 indications are that they are the same or nearly the same for all
 lasers up through the 5517D.  The 5517E has a slightly shorter tube
 overall, possibly with a much shorter bore since the heater resistance
 is only about half of what it is for the other lasers.  But I have yet
 to even remove the beam expander from a 5517E tube.
<p>
 One way to suppress rogue modes while using a longer cavity to achieve
 higher power, all other factors being equal, would be to use a weaker
 axial magnetic field.  The result would be a smaller shift of the
 neon gain curves.  But the split frequency would also be lower.
</ul>
<p>
From the above list, it would seem that options are quite limited and
only the cavity loss adjustment via the OC mirror reflectivity is known
to have a large effect on Zeeman beat frequency without affecting other
parameters that are believed to be similar or identical for all these
lasers.
<p>
It would be best to use semi-custom tubes to achieve the proper
difference frequency without torturing the tube. :)  And even
then, it's not clear if the other specifications including
required long term stability could be achieved using the
external heater.  But it would certainly be adequate for
educational purposes, both in terms of student projects
to do the installation and analyze the behavior, as well
as for general studies in laser based metrology systems.
<p>
Whether the approach of installing a standard HeNe laser tube can be used to
refurbish HP/Agilent lasers (at least 5501Bs, 5517As, and 5517Bs)
at reasonable labor cost is still not clear.  The rather short life
expectancy of most conventional HeNe laser tubes compared to genuine
HP/Agilent tubes is one major issue.  However, I am investigating the
possibility of offering to rebuild 5501B and 5517B lasers with all the
risks spelled out up front.  One option that partially deals with the
short life expectancy is to charge a much lower price for a "recharge"
when the replacement tube reaches end-of-life since much of the hard
work will already have been done.  Comments are welcome.  Please
contact me via the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
However, a more fundamental issue may be one that cannot be dealt with using
an off-the-shelf tube.  While these experiments above worked after a fashion,
it's clear that several aspects of performance are inferior compared to
those of the genuine HP/Agilent tubes.  In particular, it's not possible
to adjust the waveplates so that the MEAS signal is clean when the position
is changing <i>AND</i> there is decent independence of F1 and F2.  It may
not be possible to achieve either.  This is likely due to
very significant rogue modes being present, and these are a fundamental
property of the tube's design.  As will become clear below,
it may not be possible to even come close.
<p>
Later, I selected a tube for maximum power just to see what the result
would be in a 5517 magnet assembly.  Here is the data during mode sweep
(unstabilized) for tube #3:
<p>
<PRE>
    Parameter                      Minimum    Maximum
  ------------------------------------------------------
    Output Power (no magnet)       1.32 mW    1.38 mW
    Output Power (with magnet)     1.38 mW    1.47 mW
    Beat Frequency (with magnet)   1.26 MHz   1.58 MHz
</PRE>
<p>
Without a magnetic field, there is of course no beat frequency.  With the
tube's active discharge centered within the 5517 magnet, the beat frequency
is present for perhaps 50 percent of the mode sweep cycle.  bot the output
power and beat frequency are a minimum around the center of this region.
This is where the laser should be when it's locked - centered on the
Zeeman-split neon gain curve, but differs from the behavior of the normal
5517 laser tube, where the locked position is with minimum output power and
<i>maximum</i> beat frequency.  It's also interesting that the output
power is more than 6 percent higher in the axial magnetic field.
With a minimum output power of over 1.3 mW, this tube should produce
more than 1 mW once the optics are installed.
<p>
The increased power may be related to both the likely difference in gas-fill
isotope ratio and thus shape of the neon gain curve,
as well as the profile of the intracavity mode volume, with the long
radius hemispherical resonator configuration of this tube, compared to
a nearly pure hemispherical resonator in the genuine HP/Agilent tube.
Why this might occur is shown in
<A HREF="zeemode4.gif">Comparison of Normal and Zeemon Modes in a Short
HeNe Laser</A>.  The total output power in each plot is the sum of the red
(F1) and blue (F2) modes.  For the particular combination of cavity length and
neon gain curve depicted in the diagram, the total output power with a
magnetic field is higher than without a magnetic field.
Of course, other things affect actual output power to even with this
configuration, the difference would not likely be as dramatic.  
The lasing modes from the split gain curves are offset from the
normal longitudinal mode position - one higher and the other lower.
The difference between them results in the Zeeman beat frequency.
However, the extent of the shift is at most a few MHz, much smaller
than how it is depicted here.
<p>
I installed the tube in the magnet/optics assembly from a 5517B.  The output
power was now between 0.9 mW and 1 mW.
<p>
What I expected to happen when this tube was that it would lock normally but
with perhaps a fuzzy MEAS signal due to rogue modes.  However, this was
not the case.  In fact, it refused to lock at all within a reasonable time
and when it finally did, the lock position wasn't at the center of the
Zeeman-split gain curve, but rather near one end of the range over which
there was any beat frequency, with an output power of
around 925 uW.  The lasing line location was inferred based
on the beat frequency of around 1.46 MHz when locked.  (See the chart, above.)
At this lock position, the MEAS signal has some modest amount of fuzz
likely due to rogue modes when the position of the mirror (my
remote "tool") was changing.  But the 5508A Measurement Display was
happy enough with it and didn't generate any errors.  By fiddling with the
waveplates, it was possible to achieve a stable lock near the minimum of the
beat frequency range, presumably also near the center of the Zeeman-split neon
gain curve.  However, at this location, any change in mirror position resulted
in gargantuan amounts of fuzz with an almost unrecognizable MEAS signal and
instant "SL Error" from the 5508A.  My home-built measurement display
was also hopelessly confused losing huge numbers of counts with any position
change.  As far as I can tell, there is <i>no</i> orientations of the
waveplates that results in a totally clean MEAS signal when the remote
mirror is moving though it is quite clean over much of the range when
stationary.
<p>
The inability to lock at the correct location on the Zeeman-split neon gain
curve must mean that the rogue mode amplitudes are so large that they overwhelm
the difference of the F1 and F2 modes that should be driving the error
amplifier/heater.  Even when the lasing mode was nearly stationary at what
should have been the correct location, it would eventually drift away from it
with the beat frequency increasing until it disappeared.
For this reason among others, I don't believe it's a problem with the
thermal response of the heater/tube combination but rather based in the
fundamental nature of this tube's mode characteristics.  My next experiment
will be to monitor the output on a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI)
to actually look at the modes.  I won't be able to see the individual F1 and
F2 modes since they differ in frequency by such a small amount (less than
1.5 MHz) but should see them as one peak, along with a pair of peaks due
to the rogue modes, all spaced around 1.1 GHz apart - the FSR of the tube.
With a short tube such as this, there would be at most 2 modes lasing at
any given time if there were no magnetic field.  As the amplitude of one
increases, the amplitude of the other decreases.  But with the Zeeman-split
neon gain curve, there should be at least 3 modes, and the amplitude
of all of them will likely be quite large simultaneously.
<p>
I actually looked at the mode structure of both of the last two rebuilt lasers
on a Spectra-Physics model 470 SFPI.  (The first rebuilt laser one using the
5501A magnet assembly was no longer intact when I got around to doing these
tests.)  For the adjustable 5517 laser (tube #2) set 5517A mode (minimum REF
frequency, maximum power), the mode structure looked similar to that of a
normal healthy 5517C.  (I don't expect the mode structure to differ by
HP/Agilent laser model.)  There were at most two modes present at almost
all times and they were fairly clean, but there
were small blips present on either side in addition to the
main mode after the laser had locked.  What the SFPI wasn't
able to show was whether the split Zeeman mode consists of independent F1
and F2 components,
<p>
However, for the high power tube installed in a 5517B magnet (tube #3),
the display was....totally confusing.  This was in part due to the 2 GHz
FSR of the SFPI, which results in aliasing of any modes spanning more than
2 GHz.  But when aligned with the SFPI very carefully such that the FSR
doubles to 4 GHz, what was happening became obvious: When one mode was
at its peak - presumably centered on the Zeeman-split neon gain curve -
there were modes on either side of it with <i>greater</i> total power.
Since these would be on the opposite slopes of the neon gain curve, the
feedback error signal from them would have the opposite polarity compared
to the main modes, pushing the lock point <i>away</i> from the
center.  After many false starts, the laser did finally lock, but with 3 modes
present with relative amplitudes of approximately 15, 100, and 70 were
100 was the F1/F2 or Zeeman mode - a rather skewed arrangement to be
in a stable configuration!  But although it might take 15 minutes to
lock from a cold start, this is repeatable.
<p>
Such weirdness is much more interesting and entertaining than simply having
a higher power two-frequency laser, though perhaps not particularly useful!
<p>
Tube #4 will probably be a Spectra-Physics 007 with a total length of 4-5/8
inches and mode spacing of 1.36 GHz.  However, there are a couple potential
problems with these.  The rated output power is lower - 0.4 mW - though I
was able to find one producing about 1 mW.  And the beam diameter and
(lower) divergence will require a change to the beam expander, or just
accept a narrower beam.  Also, it's cathode-end output which makes
insulation more challenging.  But even this tube is longer than the one in a
Zygo 7705, which appears to have a length closer to 4 inches.
<p>
More to come.

<h3><A NAME="chntzees">Transverse Zeeman Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A></h3>

Several companies have produced transverse Zeeman stabilized HeNe
lasers based on PLL control of the Zeeman frequency.  With this approach, a
moderate transverse magnetic field (hundreds of gauss) produces a beat
frequency of a few hundred kHz which varies slightly as a function of mode
position on the neon gain curve and can thus be locked to a reference
frequency.
<p>
I have not found an easy to understand (either for you or for me!) explanation
of the transverse Zeeman effect resulting in the beat frequency.  So, here is
my attempt, which may include numerous errors and misinterpretations but here
goes: The beat frequency results from a combination of the natural
birefringence of the mirrors (due to coating properties and orientation) and
the magnetically induced birefringence of the plasma.  Mode pulling is
responsible for the change in beat frequency as the modes move through
the gain curve:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mirror birefringence:</b>  Manufacturing processes for dielectric
 mirrors may not produce an axially symmetric coating so the characteristics
 of the mirror varies slightly with polarization orientation.  Both the
 percentage of reflectance and the effective depth into the coating where
 the reflection is effectively produced may be affected.  Two consequences of
 the mirror birefringence are to produce a natural frequency offset
 for the two sets of orthogonally polarized lasing modes and to influence, if
 not totally determine the orientation of the two modes.  (Of course, nothing
 is ever quite so simple: There are two mirrors and they each have their
 own birefringence.  So the relative orientation of the two mirrors is also
 a factor!)  The frequency offset is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
              f * delta_L
   delta_f = -------------
                   L
</PRE>
 Where:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>f is the lasing frequency (1/wavelength).
 <li>L is the cavity length.
 <li>delta_f is the difference frequency.
 <li>delta_L is the difference in cavity length for the two polarizations.
 </ul>
<p>
 The frequency offset is typically in the 10s to 100s of kHz
 range and without other influences like mode pulling or a magnetic field,
 its value along with the mode polarization axes, remain essentially fixed
 for the life of the tube.  To put this in perspective, a shift of 100 kHz
 represents only roughly a 0.05 nm difference in cavity length for the two
 axes at 633 nm! (Newer coating techniques result in even smaller
 birefringence, which may be bad for implementing a transverse Zeeman laser!)
 However, normally, adjacent modes (orthogonally polarized in a random
 polarized tube) are separated by approximately the FSR (c/2L), which is
 600 to 700 MHz for this type of laser.  So even if they aren't quite where
 they should be, the small offset will be extremely hard
 to detect and not useful.   But if two orthogonally polarized modes could
 be forced to oscillate such that they differ only by the birefringence
 frequency, a low frequency beat would be produced.
<p>
<li><b>Transverse Zeeman splitting:</b>  The magnetic field is applied
 perpendicular to the tube axis.  The optimal strength should be such that
 the Zeeman splitting frequency is very approximately at the longitudinal
 mode spacing.  The proportionality constant is about 1.8 MHz per gauss.
 So, for a tube with a longitudinal mode spacing of 643 MHz, this implies
 about 360 gauss.
 This in effect produces a pair of "images" of the gain curve separated
 from the main gain curve by roughly the mode spacing for polarization
 perpendiculat to the magnetic field.  The uniformity of the magnetic field
 will affect the strength and purity of these modes.  The mangetic field
 doesn't affect polarization parallel to the magnetic field.  However,
 these sets of gain will now be competing for stimulation. :)  And magically,
 a pair of orthogonally polarized modes can then
 oscillate that (without mode pulling) would
 differ in frequency by the birefringence of the mirrors.  One explanation
 I've seen states that "the normal 2 longitudinal modes
 collapse into a single mode, but one with two orthogonally polarized
 components which oscillate at slightly different optical frequencies
 because of the magnetically induced birefringence of the plasma."  How
 this works is still a mystery so add suitable hand waving here. :)
<p>
 Note that while there is some dependence of the beat frequency on the
 magnetic field, it isn't that great.  If the field is too weak or too
 strong, there will be no beat at all over a portion of the mode sweep
 cycle.  Over the range where there is a beat, the actual beat frequency
 is only weakly dependent on the magnetic field.  For the experiments
 I've done (described below), the center frequency has not changed by
 more than perhaps 10 percent.  This is one reason why I not entirely
 happy with some aspects of the what's in the quoted text, above.
<p>
 The isotopic purity of the neon gas in the tube also apparently very
 strongly affects the behavior in a magnetic field.  This is described
 in the first reference, below.
</ul>
<p>
The following is from "Frequency Stabilized Lasers: Optical Feedback Effects"
by N. Brown, Applied Optics, vol. 20, no. 21, November 1, 1981:
<p>
<blockquote>
"A scheme for stabilizing a laser in a transverse magnetic field was
 first reported by Morris et. al. in 1975. Umeda et. al. have since
 described a similar system. For this experiment the 2-mW laser tube was
 furnished with sixteen U-shaped permanent magnets. These were arranged
 above and below the tube to produce a transverse magnetic field of ~0.05
 T along two-thirds of the tube's length. The two longitudinal modes of
 the tube then collapsed into a single mode over ~300 MHz of the laser
 tuning range. Although this mode is a single longitudinal mode of the
 laser cavity, it has two orthogonally polarized components, which
 oscillate at slightly different optical frequencies because of the
 magnetically induced birefringence of the plasma. This frequency
 difference depends on the magnetic field strength, the orientation of
 the field with respect to the birefringence of the mirrors, and the
 tuning of the cavity. It is the latter effect which can be used
 to control the frequency of the laser."
</blockquote>
<p>
So the key question becomes: How does the transverse magnetic field force the
two othogonally polarized modes normally separated by the FSR to coexist only
separated by the much smaller frequency offset resulting from the
birefringence of the mirrors which may in fact be very close to zero?
<p>
Here are some preliminary comments from Professor Siegman in response to my
posting on alt.lasers:
<p>
(From: A. E. Siegman" (siegman@stanford.edu).)
<p>
<blockquote>
 "Zeeman effects in He-Ne lasers, though rich and interesting, are just
 messy enough to be difficult to summarize using ASCII characters only;
 and the whole subject dropped out of fashion long enough ago
 (several decades or more) that I've not kept up to date on them.
<p>
 The physics involved is not all that arcane, though it can get messy.
 In essence, you have multiple overlapping Zeeman-split atomic
 transitions or amplification lines that are nearly but not exactly
 degenerate; a laser cavity with multiple axial modes and almost always
 some residual polarization selectivity; inhomogeneous hole burning
 effects within each line; cross saturation between lines; frequency
 pulling effects between lines and modes; and mode competition (a.k.a. gain
 competition) between the cavity modes.  Written that way it does sound
 pretty arcane, but it's more that each effect is individually not that
 complex, but when you write 'em all out it just does get messy.
<p>
 I was going to suggest Sargent, Scully and Lamb as a good (but still
 messy) discussion of the subject, but when I looked on my home office
 bookshelf I found instead an old copy of C. C. B. Garret's slim 1967
 McGraw-Hill book on "Gas Lasers" (stamped inside the front cover with
 "Withdrawn and sold by Staffordshire County Library"; and with the
 Preface starting with a quote, "Hinc lucem et poscula sacra . . . MOTTO
 OF CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY"; maybe your Latin is better than mine.)
<p>
 Anyway, it has a lot of quite clear and readable and largely non-
 mathematical discussions of gas laser mechanism from a 1967 viewpoint,
 and on pp. 117-122 a pretty nice discussion of "Magnetic Field Effects",
 including good references to the literature of that era.  If you can
 find a cheap copy on amazon or Abe Books, you might like it."
</blockquote>
<p>
So, I'll be searching for that text!
<p>
But accepting the two modes in close proximity, their precise offset is
affected by mode pulling, which shifts the exact frequency away from
that predicted by the classic mode location depending on where they
are located compared to the gain peak.  So, as the modes drift
through the "super" gain curve, the beat frequency will change.  I've
observed 10 to 20 percent but the exact amount depends on the specific
tube/magnet combination and may be much larger.
<p>
Since the difference frequency is determined by physical processes that are
only weakly affected by environmental factors (including external magnetic
fields), the result can be a highly stable optical frequency, potentially
much better than that of the common dual polarization mode stabilized HeNe
laser.
<p>
There has been considerable research done on this phenomenon back in the
glory days of HeNe lasers. :)  Two interesting papers are:

And a patent for a green (543.5 nm) transverse Zeeman laser (though I don't
know if it actually uses that term):
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>U.S. Patent #5,014,278: Method for the Frequency Stabilization of

</ul>
<p>
The Model 220 from "Laboratory for Science" (now out of business) included
a PLL synthesizer (with thumb-wheel BCD switches to set the reference
frequency) and another PLL to lock the Zeeman frequency to the reference.
See the section: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstlfs">Laboratory for Science
Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A>, which includes additional references.
<p>
A transverse magnetic field splits the frequency of the horizontal and
vertical polarized modes so that a polarizer in the beam at 45 degrees
results in the strongest and cleanest beat frequency signal
from a photodiode detector.  If the polarizer is aligned with either
mode, there is no beat.  For this laser tube with the specific magnets
used, the beat frequency varies between about 150 and 200 kHz during
mode sweep and any given frequency is unique with respect to position
on the gain curve (subject to the conditions described below) so
it should be relatively easy to phase lock the beat to a reference as
is done in the Laboratory for Science Model 220 laser.
So, whip up a CD4046 PLL with signal generator reference and the Zeeman beat
being the VCO.  Then, use the error signal to control the heater.
A somewhat simpler alternative with possibly slightly lower stability
is to compare the output of the F-V converter with a reference in an
integrator, and use that to control the heater.

<h3><A NAME="chntzeee">Transverse Zeeman HeNe Laser Experiments</A></h4>

I'm not sure that I'll ever get around to actually building a transverse
Zeeman stabilized HeNe laser, but I have done some experiments
on characterizing the beat frequency versus mode position and magnetic
field strength/configuration of the tube used in the SP-117 compatible
mode stabilized HeNe laser.  The primary reasons
this tube was selected are that (1) it has a suitable (nearly optimal)
length, (2) it is already set up for polarized mode sampling from the
waste beam, and (3) it is conveniently mounted. :)
<p>
Experiments such as these can be quite fascinating when one considers how
without any special parts or equipment, it is possible to control and
analyze the very fundamental aspects of laser operation.  Everything below
can be done using a common barcode scanner HeNe laser, a few bits of
optics (beamsplitter, polarizer, photodiodes), and less a hand full of
common electronic parts.  Any mediocre oscilloscope can be used to
display the beat frequency.  The most basic of data acquisition systems
can be used since all the relevant signals are slowly varying.
<p>
<b>Experimental setup:</b>
<p>
See <A HREF="trnszee1.gif">Setup for Transverse Zeeman HeNe Laser
Experiments</A>.  This is somewhat between a functional block diagram
and schematic as some details are omitted for clarity.
The four channel signals feed a $25 data acquisition
widget from <A HREF="http://www.dataq.com/">DATAQ</a> attached to a 10
year old notebook PC.  A set of transimpedance amps were added to the
existing mode detection photodiodes monitoring the waste beam to boost
the amplitude for channels 1 and 2.  A stop with a 0.5 mm hole
minimizes bore light reaching the photodiodes and blocks
backreflections from the beamsplitter and photodiodes.  Initially, a
supposedly non-polarizing beamsplitter provided the input for both total
power and beat frequency from the output beam.  But this was introducing some
anomalies in total power (more below) as well as reducing the
amplitude of the beat frequency input signal.  So later, a summer was
added to compute total power from the two modes, and the beat was taken
directly from the output beam (as the diagram shows).  Total power is
monitored on channel 3.  For the beat frequency, a photodiode is mounted
behind a polarizer oriented at 45 degrees to the natural axis of the polarized
modes - and the magnetic field in this case.  That angle produces the
strongest and cleanest signal.  It is AC-coupled to a Frequency to
Voltage (F-V) converter consisting of a high speed voltage comparator,
retriggerable monostable, and low pass filter.  Gain and offset
adjustments enable the limited beat frequency excursion to match the
voltage range of channel 4 of the data acquisition system.
<p>
For most of the experiments, a U-shaped aluminum frame (one half of a small
Bud Minibox!) was used to provide a way of mounting multiple magnets on each
side of a HeNe laser tube or laser head.  This allowed for easy
installation and removal as well as changing the field orientation or offset,
without disturbing anything else.  The separation is about 2-1/4 inches.
In all cases, magnets on both sides face the same way with all South
poles on one side and all North poles on the other side toward the tube.
For all but the test with a super strong magnetic field, the
magnets used are made of ferrite, about 2" by 5/8" by 1/4", magnetized
N-S on the large faces.  Their strength is estimated to be several
hundred gauss.
<p>
<b>Experimental results</b>
<p>
(A collection of the sequence of plots with increasing magnetic field of
the same orientation may be found in
<A target="a" HREF="088tzf1.pdf">Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency
Behavior Versus Transverse Magnetic Field Strength</A>.  This will open
up a <i>single</i> new window for your viewing convenience.
The field strength numbers are arbitrary but are guaranteed to increase
monotonically! :)  Individual plots (including all those in the PDF)
are linked within the text, below.)
<p>
First, a set of three ferrite magnets (A, C, and E) was placed on each side
of the tube.  The 2" x 5/8" (H x W) magnets were spaced about 5/8"
apart.  <A HREF="sp088m3.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Mode Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field</A> shows the behavior of this
tube with respect to the polarization modes and total output power.  The four
segments of data (in addition to those with no field) correspond to the
field being aligned with each of the two primary mode polarization axes and
each of the two polarities (N and S).  With no field, the modes are almost
perfectly symmetric with the orientation of the polarization changing
smoothly between P and S.  But with the field applied, the modes become
moderately polarized.  Note how the frequency of the ripples
has doubled.  The mode amplitudes continue to change smoothly without
flipping but they no longer want to change very much from a polarization
determined by the orientation of the magnetic field.  This doubling is
consistent with the mode splitting where all modes appear in both
oreintations.  Curiously however, the polarization preference is
<i>opposite</i> what it would be if a very strong magnetic field were
applied in the same direction to cause the tube to become linearly
polarized.  Varying the strength of the field strength will be shown
to produce some very interesting behavior.
<p>
Before examining the effects of various magnetic
fields more closely, as a reference, refer to
<A HREF="sp088m2.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 HeNe Laser Tube During
Warmup (Detail)</A>.  This shows a few cycles of the mode sweep with
no magnetic field.  For this length tube, the P-Mode (red) and
S-Mode (blue) plots represent the two dominant longitudinal modes.  There
may be some low level additional modes contributing to these when near
the peaks and the center of the gain curve, but for the purposes
of this discussion, they can be ignored.  So, each mode cycle here has a
period of 2 FSRs or a change in tube length of 1 wavelength at 633 nm since
there a mode in between.  And from one peak to an adjacent peak (red
to blue or blue to red) is 1 FSR.  Since the modes also differ in
frequency by 1 FSR which in the case of this tube is 643 MHz, there
can be no low frequency beat.
<p>
<A HREF="sp088m5.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior in
a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-3)</A> shows the frequency of the
beat obtained from a photodiode sampling the output beam with the three
sets of magnets.  This is the identical magnet configuration as in the
plot with the multiple magnet orientations, above.  The magnetic field
in this case is aligned with the P-Polarization (red) axis.
The brown curve is the output of the F-V converter
with the approximate calibration in kHz shown on the left.
<p>
For this peculiar double frequency mode behavior,
the peaks of the P-Polarization (red) correspond to the two modes
being equally spaced on either side of the (original) gain curve and maximum
total power.  Similarly, the peaks of the S-Polarization (blue) correspond to
a single mode at the peak of the (original) gain curve and minimum total power.
(This is similar to what would happen with a conventional polarized laser
where adjacent modes of the same polarization are 1 FSR apart rather than
2 FSRs as is the case with a random polarized laser.)
For both those cases, the frequency is approximately in the middle of
its range, most rapidly increasing or decreasing, respectively.
However, the beat frequency is a minimum or maximum when the polarized
mode amplitudes are changing most rapidly.  This does NOT correspond
to where the modes are equally spaced on either side of the gain curve
nor where a single mode is centered on the gain curve peak, but it is
roughly half way in between.
<p>
See <A HREF="sp088mf.gif">Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
Versus Mode Position on Gain Curve (Hor-N-3)</A>.  The purple modes on
the little gain curves are referenced back to the mode locations with
no magnetic field.  With the field, the distinction between the P-Mode
and S-Mode becomes fussy since the laser is operating in the funny single
mode regime.  The fat red and blue bars show the actual contributions from the
P-Mode and S-Mode with the magnetic field.
<p>
The relationship of the beat frequency to the phase of the mode
amplitudes remains the same regardless of which of the
four magnet orientations are used (from the first plot), lagging
the P-Polarization by about 90 degrees and leading the S-Polarization
by about 90 degrees.  For example,
<A HREF="sp088m6.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior in
a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Ver-N-3)</A> has the magnetic field at 90
degrees compared to the previous plot.  As can be seen,
the various amplitudes and frequency excursion do change slightly.
<p>
The shape and amplitude of the total power waveform in these and the following
two plots may not be quite correct due in part to some peculiarity of the
supposedly non-polarizing beamsplitter used to split the total power and
beat frequency beams so it may actually have a slightly smaller ripple than
shown.  That beamsplitter definitely has enough of a polarizing effect to be
annoying (probably about 10 percent at 633 nm).  I originally suspected
this because the shape changes noticeably when using the transmitted or
reflected beam for the total power photodiode.  For all subsequent plots,
I added a summer to the mode op-amps to calculate the total power from
them rather than to measure it separately.  The gains were equalized so
the the measured total power (without the beamsplitter) and the computed
total power were the same.
<p>
I also tried orienting the same sets of magnets at 45 degrees with respect
to the primary mode axes.  This resulted in little or no beating over any
part of the mode cycle regardless of output polarizer orientation.
<p>
Later, I repeated the same experiment with only 2 magnets on each side of
the tube.  With this setup, no matter how they were arranged, there
was a detectable beat over only a very limited part of the mode cycle,
two small to be of use and rather boring.  We return to this later.
<p>
So, then I went to a larger number of similar magnets - 4 magnets (A, B, C,
and E, equally spaced  about 3/16" apart.  They were individually
taped in place on the aluminum frame so as not to jump away, as they tended
to do being oriented with like poles pairs repelling each other on the 
sides.  I took data in the original (Hor-N) orientation.  The frequency
excursion increased by about 15 or 20 percent, but the center
frequency was virtually unchanged.  This is shown in <A HREF="sp088m7.gif">Plot
of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior in a Moderate Transverse
Magnetic Field (Hor-N-4)</A>.  Note the increased excursion of the
frequency and also that the two mode amplitudes are much closer to being
equal with slightly less ripple.  The scale factors for all three sets
of plots are approximately the same.
<p>
Next, I squeezed 5 magnets side-by-side touching (A-E) with the results shown
in <A HREF="sp088m8.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-5)</A>.  The modes are
closer to being overlapping.  The beat frequency
excursion has increased by a few percent (note frequency scale change
to make it fit on this and the next two plots!).
<p>
Now a little wiggle or dip has developed on the rising edge of each cycle
of the frequency waveform.  With 3 and 4 magnets, that was just a momentary
reduction in slope.  Here, it actually reverses direction.  That also
coincides with the point of smallest beat signal amplitude.  During the
first few cycles of warmup, the signal drops out momentarily around that
point and for a stronger magnetic field, the signal becomes too small
or non-existent on every cycle.  That dipsydoodle behavior is also mentioned
in the Laboratory for Science Model 220 manual as a possible place the PLL
feedback loop will get stuck (if the particular tube/magnet combination has
it).  Their solution is to manually open the feedback loop, allow the tube
to warm up or cool off for one half of a mode cycle, then close the feedback
loop so it locks on the large falling slope.  Well, whatever works. :)
<p>
Adding a sixth pair of magnets next to the others had no significant effect.
But, placing an additional magnet on each side cross-wise at the center of
the stack of 5 magnets (A-E with F on taped on top of them) did allow the
modes to completely overlap as shown in
<A HREF="sp088m9.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-6)</A>.  The ripples have
decreased in amplitude significantly.  I'm beginning to be convinced that
the size and relative amplitude of the ripples is affected to some extent
by the uniformity of the magnetic field.
<p>
Pushing the magnet array slightly to one side (which must increase
the field seed inside the bore) forced the modes to start to move apart,
continuing in the same direction as the field increased as shown in
<A HREF="sp088ma.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-7)</A>.  The dip
has become larger but not much else has changed.  Then, pushing the magnets
further to one side results in the ripple becoming larger as shown in
<A HREF="sp088mb.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-8)</A>.
And, the beat frequency can be seen
to disappear twice each time around the location of the now very
pronounced dip.
<p>
As expected, adding a 7th set of magnets pushed the modes still
further apart but interestingly, the beat frequency now does not disappear
entirely at any time but does have some serious wiggles and a much greater
excursion within the wiggles as shown in
<A HREF="sp088mg.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-9)</A>
(note another scale change).  However, observing the waveform on an
oscilloscope reveals that the time waveform during that transition
region of rapidly varying frequeniecs is not a pure tone but a mixture
of at least two frequencies.
<p>
Then, removing the magnets from the frame altogether so they could
be placed closer together pushed the modes even further apart to the
point where the laser is almost totally polarized but
now the beat does disappear for about 30 percent of the mode cycle
as shown in <A HREF="sp088mh.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman
Frequency Behavior in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field
(Hor-N-10)</A>.
<p>
And, for completeness, I went back and moved the magnets 8 inches apart
to reduce the field to a very low value.  I used the 6 magnet array for
convenience since at this large distance, the field seen by the bore of
the tube will be quite uniform regardless of the specific magnet
configuration.  The result is shown in
<A HREF="sp088mi.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-1)</A>.  Note
how the modes have just begun to flip into the double frequency
behavior.  There is no beat except for a glitch of random height
just where the modes would have crossed if no field was present.
Increasing the field slightly by moving the magnets 5 inches apart
results in a beat for part of the mode cycle as shown in
<A HREF="sp088mj.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N-2)</A>.
<p>
There's also one other quirk worth mentioning: Without a magnetic field,
both modes tend to increase in power during warmup, along with the ripples, and
of course the total power.  But here, after the first minute, the P Mode and
its ripples are virtually constant in amplitude, or slightly decreasing.
In fact, if allowed to run out to 20 or 30 minutes, the envelope of the
P Mode goes down by another 5 percent while the S-Mode remains constant.
<p>
And I'm sure you were wondering what would happen with an even more
powerful magnetic field.  You were, weren't you? :-) With the single
pair of super strength rare earth magnets that will convert a random polarized
tube to a linearly polarized tube, there was absolutely no detectable beat
frequency.  (The orientation was similar to F but on a frame that
produced a separation of only about 1-1/2 inches.)  The lack of any beat
isn't surprising considering that when linearly polarized, the amplitude of
the required orthogonally polarized mode is very close to zero.  See <A
HREF="sp088mc.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Mode Behavior in a Strong
Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N)</A>.  So, there's a range of
magnetic field strength and configuration where there is any beat, and
an even smaller range where the beat is present during the entire mode
cycle as in these plots.
<p>
However, note from the plot that although the S-Mode (blue) is quite close
to 0, the P-Mode (red) and total power are rather lumpy.  Of course, this
is probably not the ideal magnetic field configuration to force linear
polarization being only a single pair of magnets.  And, the polarization
ratio is probably only about 50:1, not the 500:1 or 1000:1 of a normal
linearly polarized HeNe laser.
<p>
In the future, I intend to return to these experiments filling in some of
the missing pieces with better control of magnetic field.  Perhaps, I'll
find a nice 10 ton electromagnet on eBay. :)
<p>
<b>Summary of Zeeman beat observations</b>
<p>
So, here is the behavior for this specific laser tube, a Spectra-Physics 088,
serial number blah blah :), outputting about 1.4 mW, random
polarized.  The cavity length is such that normally, only two modes will
oscillate simultaneously except when a mode is very close to gain center.
Then, there may be a small contribution from two modes out on the tails of
the gain curve but this can be ignored.  The mode spacing is nominally
643 MHz.
<p>
For the following, refer to the fabulous PDF which combines the mode
plots in <A target="a" HREF="088tzf1.pdf">Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency
Behavior Versus Transverse Magnetic Field Strength</A>.  This will open
up a <i>single</i> new window for your viewing convenience.
The field strength numbers are arbitrary but are guaranteed to increase
monotonically! :)  And recall that the
ripple frequency with a magnetic field is double that of the normal mode
sweep shown in the first plot.  The horizontal scale factors are not all quite
equal on these plots, but they are fairly close on the first pair so that
provides a good comparison of no field and moderate field behavior with
respect to ripple.  And, it really doesn't take much of a magnetic filed to
destroy that wonderful symmetry in the first plot!
<p>
<ul>
<li>With no external magnetic field, the two two modes are orthogonally
 polarized and very well behaved.  They cycle very smoothly with no
 flipping.  Thus each mode retains the same polarization (P or S) throughout
 its march through the gain curve.  The mode separation is then
 approximately 643 MHz.  The waveforms of the two modes are basically
 time-shifted versions of each other.  They are nearly identical in every
 respect with the power in each mode varying from close to 0 to nearly the
 total power in a period corresponding to a change in cavity length of
 1 wavelength (633 nm).
<p>
<li>With a magnetic field applied parallel to one of the natural
 polarization axes of the tube, the two modes cease to behave the same
 (except for the time shift).  Their power becomes much more constant but
 with ripples with a period corresponding to a length change of 1/2 wavelength
 (316 nm).  The magnitude and shape of the ripples may depend on both the
 strength and uniformity (or lack thereof) of the magnetic field.
 In essense, there is a single split mode which moves through the gain
 curve with its two parts trading power back and forth (the ripples).
 A relatively small magnetic field breaks the symmetry of the original
 mode sweep but somewhat more is required for a beat to appear.
<p>
<li>As the magnetic field is increased, the P-Polarized mode parallel to the
 magnetic field increases in power and the S-Polarized mode perpendicular
 to the magnetic field decreases in power.
<p>
<li>There is a beat frequency present when the output is passed through a
 polarizer at 45 degrees for at least part of the mode sweep cycle over a
 wide range of moderate magnetic fields.  The frequency varies by 10 to 20
 percent (for this tube) in a smooth way as a function of mode position
 but only y excursion varies only slightly as a function of the magnetic
 field.
<p>
 For the following, see <A HREF="sp088mf.gif">Spectra-Physics
 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior Versus Mode Position on Gain Curve
 (Hor-N-3)</A>.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Peak output power occurs at the same location as with no field - where
  the modes would be equally spaced on either side of the gain curve.  This
  is also approximately the center of the beat frequency excursion with
  the greatest positive slope.
 <p>
 <li>Minimum output power occurs at the same location as with no field - where
  a mode would be centered on the gain curve.  This
  is also approximately the center of the beat frequency excursion with
  greatest negative slope.
 <p>
 <li>The mean output power and maximum and minimum frequency excursions occur
  when the modes would be halfway between these points.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Somewhat beyond this range of magnetic field strength, the beat will be
 present for only part of the mode sweep cycle.
<p>
<li>For the case of no magnetic field, there is no low frequency beat because
 the modes are always approximately 1 FSR apart.
<p>
<li>For a very strong magnetic field, there is no low frequency beat because
 the mode perpendicular to the magnetic field has close to zero power.
<p>
<li>While the specific profile of the magnetic field has some effect, the
 dominant parameter affecting mode and beat frequency behavior seems to be
 its overall strength.
<p>
<li>If the magnetic field is applied at an angle far from the natural
 polarization axes of the tube, the behavior is either erratic and/or
 there is no beat.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Stick-slip noise</b>
<p>
Note the glitches in time on several cycles of
<A HREF="sp088md.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field with Stick-Slip Noise (Hor-N-6,
Heating)</A>.
I have always believed that these are a manifestation of sudden miniscule
changes in the length of the SP-088 laser tube but the exact source wasn't
obvious.  Hypothesis #1 was that the thick glass capillary (bore) where the
plasma discharge is concentrated is supported near the cathode-end by a metal
structure called a "spider" - a bunch of sheet metal fingers attached
to the cathode-can which prevent the bore from moving sideways either
due to gravity or a physical shock.  The plasma discharge heats the
bore, which is the first thing to expand.  It
pushes on the anode-end of the tube directly and the cathode-end
through the spider support in the cathode-can.  Eventually, the force
is such that the bore slips in the spider and the overall length of
the tube (the distance between the mirrors) gets smaller.  In all cases
where such a glitch is observed, it's similar to jumping back in time.
So far so good.  That's what the plot shows.  But it was unsatisfying.
One reason that I was not totally convinced of this explanation
is that the decrease is always on the order of a small fraction of a
wavelength of the 633 nm light.  (The length change for a complete cycle
of either mode with no magnetic field is 1 wavelength or 2 FSRs.)  That small
size and relative consistency doesn't seem totally credible for a
metal-to-glass friction fit that's usually quite tight.  In addition
the transition time is around 1/10th of a second which seems a bit slow.
Similar glitches occur from time-to-time during warmup.  So tight
that there might not even be a single slip during warmup of a typical
tube.  So, hypothesis #2 is that the source is the heater blanket
on this tube which includes multiple layers of insulating plastic sheet
in addition to the copper coil.  Only portions of it are taped and nothing
is glued.  The plastic of the blanket has a coefficient
of thermal expansion which is much much larger than that of the glass.  So,
even though it is not being heated directly by the plasma but rather from 
the outer glass, it will still expand faster than the glass.  And there are
many places where there could be very small slippage.  As a test, allowing
the tube to heat up with the external heater on and then shutting off only the
external heater produces a similar set of jumps as shown
in <A HREF="sp088me.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Zeeman Frequency Behavior
in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field with Stick-Slip Noise (Hor-N-6,
Cooling)</A>.  These are also back in time as the
plastic now cools and contracts faster than the glass, which is consistent
with this explanation.  If it were the bore-spider interface, the jumps
should be forward in time because the bore temperature remains relatively
constant or at most is slowly decreasing (when the heater power is turned
off but the plasma is still lit), but the blanket/outer tube temperature
is declining repidly and the bore would be holding it back until the slip.
This is has never been observed to happen.
<p>
These unsightly blemishes occur somewhat randomly but their frequency
has been increasing as the tube is temperature cycled, implying that whatever
is moving is loosening up.  At first I thought the magnets
were the cause, since it only started happening when I was playing
with the sets of 3 magnets.  But the tube does the same thing now
without any magnets.  In fact, it has become difficult to find a
clean run of more than 15 or 20 seconds.  The portions of the data used
for some of the earlier plots had to be carefully selected to not include
any glitches. :)
<p>
Avoiding stick-slip behavior
is highly desirable in stabilized lasers since it can result in
unpredictable effects on the feedback loop.  In the case of this tube,
reworking the heater blanket would probably be all that is needed.
Gluing a thin film heater to the tube would be one solution.
Removing it and running some more tests is the obvious way of
obtaining confirmation, but that's not going to happen. :)  I may try
another similar tube without a heater though any negative results (no
glitches) would not be absolute proof of the blanket hypothesis.
But a positive result would indicate that the stick-slip is happening
inside the tube and hyposthesis #2 is wrong.
<p>
Some tubes have internal stick-slip due to a spider or other bore support
that's loose enough to result in periodic micro-movements of the bore
relative to the support.  Since the entire change in length is a small
fraction of 1 mm, a compliant structure that doesn't permit any slip
would suffice.  Thus, Laboratory for Science
had special tubes made which either has no support (except where it's
fused into the anode-end of the tube) or a compliant bore support,
and their external heater is well glued to the tube.  Driving the heater
coil on my SP-088 reduces the incidence of the glitches significantly
during at least part of the warmup period by causing the outer tube
envelope to expand at a rate much closer to that of the bore.  I suppose
there is some optimum "heater power function" for this. :)

<h4><A NAME="chntzet1">Transverse Zeeman Laser Testbed 1</A></h4>

Using the natural thermal expansion of the SP-088 tube provides a fine means
of data collection for a fixed magnetic field.  However, it's too slow to
enable real-time manipulation of the magnetic field to readily determine
how it interacts with the lasing modes and Zeeman beat frequency.  In addition,
the period of the mode cycles increases as the tube warms up and eventually
become too long to be useful, so it's necessary to allow the tube to cool
for approximately the same amount of time it was powered on.
<p>
Therefore, it would be nice to have an apparatus for experimenting with
the mode and Zeeman frequency behavior in real-time.  Rather than depending
on thermal expansion, the Zeeman Laser Testbed (ZLT) would use a tube with
(preferably) two perpendicular windows super AR coated on both surfaces to
minimize any orientation preference.  See <A HREF="trnszee2.gif">Transverse
Zeeman HeNe Laser Testbed</A>.  (A less desirable but acceptable alternative
would be a tube with a single perpendicular window and an internal HR at the
other end.)  (A Brewster window tube cannot be used for this purpose because it
automatically results in a polarized beam and there would be no beat signal.)
The OC mirror would then be external and mounted on a PieZo Transducer (PZT)
to move it back and forth by a few wavelengths at 633 nm, and on a pan-tilt
adjustable mount for alignment and a rotary mount to adjust orientation..
The HR mirror (for the two-window tube) would be similarly mounted, but
without being on a PZT.  With the rotary mounts, it would then be possible
to explore mirror birefringence in depth, both for the transverse Zeeman
laser, and to see what effect it has on mode flipping behavior.
The best type of tube would be of side-arm construction where
the bore is fully exposed over its entire length.  This would enable
much more precise control of the magnetic field configuration with
less poerful magnets.  However, I
don't know of the existence of such a beast and doubt one was ever built
except possibly for research purposes.  Melles Griot does list perpendicular
window tubes of normal construction, thought they apparently are not
generally available except as a special order.  A Melles Griot 05-WHR-570
might be suitable though it is a bit long - about 10 inches - and may not
like to oscillate on a suitably small number of modes even with the output
mirror nearly in contact with the window.  The resonator length would then be
10 inches, about 3/4" longer than that of the SP-088.
<p>
The OC mirror would be glued to a PZT on a rotary adjustable mount attached to
a low expansion baseplate, as would the HR (except for lack of a PZT).
The tube would be mounted to the same
baseplate but supported at one end on a compliant mount so that it
is free to move axially by a few tenths of a millimeter.  Then, one end
would move freely and smoothly due to thermal expansion.  This would be
most important if using a one-window tube with internal HR so
the length of the cavity would not change and there would be no
chance of externally induced stick-slip noise either.  However, it won't
hurt in the two-window tube system and eliminates one (if small) unknown.
The PZT would be driven with a function generator in the same manner
as a Scanning Fabry Perot Interferometer (SFPI).  This would then permit
a real-time display of several modes.  But unlike the SFPI, the ZLT
display would be similar to plots shown above, but in real-time.  An
SFPI could be set up as well and would aid in correlating the mode
amplitudes with lasing line position.  However, both the ZLT and SFPI
wouldn't be driven at the same time.  With the rotary mounts, it would
be easy to change the relative orientation of the two mirrors as well
as their orientation with respect to the magnet.  (With a one-window
tube, this is stll possible but the tube would need to be rotated
in the magnet.  And, only the one instance of the internal HR mirror
would be available.
<p>
Ideally, the ZLT would use a superconducting magnet.  OK, just kidding. :)
The maximum field strength only needs to be a few hundred gauss.
However, it would be nice to have an electromagnet with wide pole pieces
attached to an adjustable DC power supply, rather than stacks of
permanent magnets.  This would allow for more precise control of
the field strength and a more uniform field.  But I doubt such a
thing will materialize.
<p>
A mode sensor assembly similar to the one on the SP-088 setup would
be attached to the same preamps for monitoring on an oscilloscope or
fast data acquisition system.  A photodiode for the Zeeman beat would
mounted in the output beam behind a polarizer oriented at 45 degrees
to the magnet and polarization axes.
<p>
The same type of PC-based data acquisition system could serve as the
instrumentation but a much higher capture rate would be required.
An alternative might be a 4 channel digitizing oscilloscope (something
else what probably won't happen).  Realistically, the real-time display
is only needed while experimenting with parameters like magnetic field.
The data for any specific configuration can be acquired slowly.
<p>
Another desirable feature would be for both the tube and OC mirror to be
on rotatable mounts so that the birefringence of the HR and OC mirrors
could be tested and adjusted (by rotating the OC relative to the HR)
before a magnetic field is applied.
<p>
I did a quick experiment (well, actually it took an entire morning!)
using an 05-LHB-270 one-Brewster tube with a 60 cm RoC OC mirror glued
to a piezo beeper element.  See <A HREF="obteomp1.gif">One-Brewster HeNe Laser
Tube with External OC Mirror on PZT</A>.  That worked quite nicely but with a
polarized beam, only the total power fluctuations could be seen.  My
ancient Wevetek function generator provided more than enough voltage
swing to get 4 or 5 full mode cycles in one sweep (each being one half
of 633 nm).  I added a differential driver to boost the PZT voltage
for good measure (taking the rest of the day!).  This consisted of a
pair of op-amp stages - a gain of 2 followed by a gain of -1 with the
PZT connected between the op-amp outputs.  The resulting differential
signal of more than 50 V p-p increased the mode display to at least 10
complete cycles.  The only problem with this setup is that the
alignment is quite critical to avoid amplitude changes during the
sweep, but this is also easy to adjust while watching the scope
display.  See <A HREF="henesca1.jpg">Effect of Mirror Alignment on Scanning
Cavity HeNe Total Power Display</A>.  The p-p amplitude of the power variation
is about 4 percent of the total power.  The difference between the three
scope traces is simply one of very slight tilt of the PZT/OC mount.
Such behavior may be inherent with a setup such as this.
Or, my cheap PZT may not be moving perfectly along the optical axis.
I do have a higher quality PZT cylinder with a mirror
already attached, but that would almost certainly require a much higher
drive voltage.
<p>
There is another peculiarity that would be hard to attribute to the
mediocre PZT characteristics: The shape of the total power waveform,
especially at the dip or mode hop location, on the forward stroke of
the PZT is not the mirror image of the waveform on the reverse stroke
of the PZT as would be expected if there were no time dependence.
And, the differences increase with PZT sweep/slew rate.  The asymmetry
is quite noticeable when scanning at 100 Hz but disappears when moving
slowly.  For example, in the traces, above, there
is a negative going spike on the left side of each total power bump and
the amplitude is slightly lower for the positive ramp compared to the
negative ramp.  (I can't tell if the positive ramp corresponds to the
forward or reverse stroke though.)  Under some conditions, this may be
even more apparent.  I can only hypothesize that this behavior is due
to the cavity relaxation time following the mode hop.  No deficiency in
the PZT operation or cavity itself can account for the asymmetry, but I
am surprised that there is anything noticeable even at millisecond time
scales when dealing with the laser dynamics!  So, perhaps there is a more
mundane explanation.  But it's not a problem with the photodiode (an
expensive Thorlabs DET210 and $2 one produce identical results) or
the scope response.
<p>
I did notice a couple other things that were confusing at first but
then made perfect sense.  (These relate to the experimental setup but
not to the Zeeman effect or PZT specifically.)  The first was an
oscillation on the photodiode signal that I first thought was due to
my vintage Tek 465B scope which I know to have a bit of high frequency
ripple on the vertical amplifier.  However, it turned out to be caused
by high frequency ripple in the HeNe laser power supply affecting the
output power.  Since the p-p amplitude of the variation in total power
is only about 4 percent of the absolute total power, slight changes in
tube current are in effect amplified and become quite noticeable.
Substituting a linear HeNe laser power supply (an SP-256) quieted this
down but replaced it with 60 Hz ripple.  Arrrrg.  After trying several
other supplies, I found one that is much better.  It is a 12 VDC input
brick and runs nicely from an ancient Toshiba laptop power pack.
<p>
The second effect was periodic major drops in output power more or less at
random but averaging every few seconds.  These were as much as 5 or 10
times the p-p amplitude of the variation in total power with the entire trace
sometimes dropping off the scope screen momentarily.  I rearranged anode
wiring, tried a different HeNe laser power supply, tried a different
photodiode, made sure the scope wasn't noisy using a 9 V battery, and finally
invoked some little known incantations reserved for this purpose. :)
Nothing helped.  Then the light bulb went off: This is an open cavity laser
without any cover between the Brewster window and mirror mount,
and my "lab" isn't exactly dust-free.  The setup was acting as a nice
particle detector so that any time a speck of dust wondered through the
intracavity beam path, it caused a momentary dip in output power, which
could be quite significant depending on its size.
<p>
I now have been able to borrow a dual perpendicular window HeNe (gain) tube
and hope to shed light (no pun...) on some of these issues.  The first
priority will actually be related to determining what causes some HeNe lasers
to be flippers and others to be well behaved.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhmfo">HeNe Mode Flipper Observations</A>.)
This is apparently one of those grand mysteries of the
Universe that even the Ph.D. types at major laser companies have been
pondering for eons without resolution. :)
<p>
You've heard of an optical bread-board and may have used one or more.
Well, this Transverse Zeeman Laser Testbed is built on an optical
butcher-block as shown in <A HREF="trnzetb1.jpg">Photo of Transverse
Zeeman Test Bed Using Dual Perpendicular Window HeNe Laser Tube</A>.
It's not quite as fancy as the diagram, above, and the arrangement of
components differs somewhat, but all the functions are there - and more.
The antique walnut-stained butcher-block slab really does have more than
adequate stability for the laser resonator and I'm not limited to
putting stuff on 1 inch centers - they will go wherever my cordless
drill takes them! :)

This is tube is much longer than optimal so that the distance between the
mirrors of the laser resonator is about 18 inches.  I would have much
preferred something less than 10 inches so that the FSR would be more than
approximately 600 MHz and only at most 3 modes at most would oscillate.
For this long laser, without additional restrictions, 4 to 6 longitudinal
modes will be oscillating.  I'm getting about 3 mW out each end
with both the left and right mirrors being 99%@633nm with a Radius of
Curvature (RoC) of 60 cm.
<p>
The PZT on which the left mirror is glued directly to the type of beeper
used in a digital watch.  The PZT will be driven by a function generator
to enable the effects of cavity length on polarized modes to be displayed
in real time rather than depending on thermal expansion to produce mode
sweep.  With the addition of a dual op-amp boost circuit, the output will
be almost 60 V p-p, more than enough for several FSRs of scan range.
<p>
There is an adjustable aperture in the cavity directly in front of the left
mirror so it can be stopped down to force TEM00:  When stopped way down,
it's low enough power that maybe only a couple modes are oscillating.
Or, a bunch may be oscillating at low power.  I haven't checked this out yet.
<p>
The right mirror is on a rotatable mount to see if mirror orientation
will affect polarization orientation, polarization flip, and Zeeman
beat frequency.  Unfortunately, it's not precise enough to avoid needing
realignment after anything but a small angle change.  But I doubt even
a fancy expensive mount would be much better.
<p>
The tube itself can be rotated between the two sets of 4 fastening screws
to see if the polarization preference sticks with the tube.  If the bore
is centered, the rotation shouldn't require other adjustments. ;-)
<p>
And the polarizing beam sampler (both modes) can also be rotated to locate
the polarization axes and orient it with them.  The beam sampler feeds my
DATAQ PC-based data acquisition system.  It will run fast enough to be used
with an oscilloscope, but I can't take photos off of that easily.
<p>
Presently, this setup is really intended to investigate issues of polarization
orientation and mode flipping, but lacks a couple features needed for the
transverse Zeemain experiments.  One of these would be a way of rotating the
left mirror (on the PZT).  And for the actual transverse Zeeman experiments,
another photodiode behind a polarizer at 45 degrees to the polarization axes
(wherever they end up) will be fed from the beam exiting the left end of the
laser.
<p>
<b>Some very preliminary results</b>
<p>
With the setup as shown above, I set out to begin to characterize its
behavior with respect to polarized modes and mode flipping.  For this,
a maximum of 3 longitudinal modes should be oscillating at the same time
so that the variation in mode amplitude from the PZT-induced mode sweep
can be easily displayed.  The two OC mirrors (rather than an OC and HR)
increases the cavity losses and raises the lasing threshold.  And by
closing down the aperture, the laser could be forced to run single
spatial mode (TEM00).  There comes a point where it indeed is only
oscillating on 2 or 3 longitudinal modes.  The adjustment is somewhat
finicky but has resulted in some initial observations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The polarized mode axes appear to be mostly determined by the orientation
 of the tube.  For this tube, the mode axes are approximately 45 degrees from
 the tip-off (unlike many tubes where they are aligned with the tip-off).
 Rotating the tube by 45 degrees or 90 degrees results in the polarization
 axes also rotating by a similar amount.  Thus, the polarizing beam
 sampler has to be rotated by the same amount to maximize the amplitude of
 the mode sweep due to the PZT.  Rotating only the right mirror
 and then adjusting alignment has little effect on the orientation
 of the polarized mode axes.
<p>
<li>Mirror alignment as well as centering of the tube and aperture do affect
 mode flipping behavior.  It's not clear what specific parameter is most
 significant as yet.  But by careful adjustments at any relative orientation of
 the tube and right mirror, the behavior can be varied from being relatively
 well behaved, to that of a pure flipper.
</ul>
<p>
What specific characteristic of the two-window tube is locking the
polarization axes to it isn't obvious.  It could be asymmetry in the
AR-coated windows, very slight tilt of the windows, or something
to do with the bore profile or straightness.  However, since the
lasing mode with the aperture stopped down should not be near the
walls of the bore, the latter seems less likely.  So, it must be
something with the windows.  It shouldn't really be very surprising
to realize that a very small asymmetry would be sufficient to produce
a large effect given that on average, a photon traverses
the windows 100 times or more before escaping. :)
<p>
More to come including more and better photos.

<h4><A NAME="chntzet2">Transverse Zeeman Laser Testbed 2</A></h4>

However, then it occurred to me that there are ways of changing the
distance between mirrors that will work with any internal mirror HeNe
laser tube.  Some are downright low tech.  Of course, the thermal expansion
approach discussed extensively above is one such technique.  But it's
slow.  While it's easy to heat the tube quickly, cooling it would require
blowing cool air on it (as some stabilized HeNe lasers do) or some type
of close fitting thermo-electric enclosure.  Even so, getting sub-second
response would be difficult.  
<p>
But based on the Young's modulus for borosilicate glass, the amount of
force required to change the length of a typical HeNe laser tube like
an SP-088 by a few wavelengths is on the order of a small number of
pounds.  So, what about a totally mechanical system that squeezes the
tube based on an applied voltage?  A cylindrical PZT could do this but
not a beeper-type PZT.  And my inventory of cylindrical PZTs is rather
bare.  What about an electromagnet?  This might work.  In principle, a
speaker voice coil type affair pushing on one end of the tube could
apply enough force but it might be quite challenging using available
junk parts.  But what about simply using a lever system to push on
one end of the tube?  Then, an electromagnet in the form of a solenoid
attracting a plunger can be located away from the tube itself (to keep
it's magnetic field from interfering with the transverse magnetic field
under study) and the lever system would add some mechanical advantage as well.
<p>
A scheme such as this has some other advantages as well, most notable
being that it would be relatively easy to quickly test a variety of
tubes as long as they are approximately the same length.  With the 1-W tube,
the selection (at least as a practical matter) is quite limited.  As
presently exactly 0.00.  Perhaps one of these tubes will materialize
someday, but not a box of them.  Of course, it is more limited in the
sense that the mirror birefringence for any given tube is fixed, while
it could be changed with the 1-W tube by rotating the OC mirror or
replacing it.  In addition, intracavity birefringent control optics like
waveplates could be added.  However, sometimes it's necessary to do
experiments with what you have, not what you might want. :)
<p>
So, Plan B is to provide a lever where the short arm
presses on the non-output-end mirror mount and the long arm of the lever
will be pulled by a solenoid or an eccentric motor driven cam.  Initial
tests have been promising.  My lever is mounted on the ball bearing
assembly from a defunct hard drive with sheet metal screwed to it in
place of the disk heads.  Not surprisingly, Siemens HeNe laser tubes
seem to work better than Spectra-Physics tubes due to their lighter
thinner construction which means that less force will result in th4e
same length change.  It's quite easy to apply enough force with the
lever to go through several complete mode cycles,  Some
care needs to be taken to assure that the force is applied as much as
possible along the axis of the tube to avoid a significant change in
alignment that would affect total output power.  But, by eye at least,
that so far does not seem to be a major problem.
<p>
Stay tuned (but it might be awhile).

<h4><A NAME="chntzet3">Transverse Zeeman Laser Testbed 3</A></h4>

This one takes advantage of an existing laser which already has a fast
cavity length adjustment, specifically the HP-5500C or HP-5501A interferometry
lasers.  These have the same tube, whose rear mirror is mounted on a PZT with
a range of about 2 FSRs for a voltage input of 0 to 1,500 V.  A high voltage
ramp generator can be used to drive the PZT but it has to have a range
of near 1,500 V.  I tried an SP-476 scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer
driver but even on the 1 kV range, it could barely move the mirror through
1 FSR.  Another alternative might be a PMT power supply.  However, the HP
lasers include a convenient controllable PZT HV power supply module that can
be adapted for this purpose and they have a full 1.5 kV range.
<p>
HP-5501A lasers often appear on eBay and although they are
likely high mileage and well below spec'd power, there may still be enough life
remaining for any reasonable experiments.  However, it should be confirmed
that there is some output before buying as it's possible for them to have
extremely hard-start or no-start tubes, or be too weak to be useful even here.
HP-5500Cs also turn up, though less frequently, but they are older and the
tubes are even less likely to work well enough for experiments.
<p>
The PZT HV power supply runs on 15 VDC.  In the original laser, the pinkish
wire is -15 VDC and the black wire is ground or 0 VDC.  The control input,
PZT CON (white wire with a red stripe), is referenced from -15 VDC and has
a calibration of 10 V/kV.  This input has a rather low impedance (about 1K
ohms) so I added a 200 ohm series resistor from the function generator output
just for insurance to not load down its output too much.  This cuts down the
input signal somewhat but it covers the full 1.5 kV range. 
There is also a monitor signal, PZT MON (white wire with a yellow stripe) that
tracks the actual HV output and has a calibration of 1 V/kV referenced to
ground.  Its impedance is rather high so a Hi-Z meter or scope probe
is needed to get an accurate reading.  PZT MON may just be a 1:1000 ratio
tap on a really high resistance voltage divider from the HV output, which
also serves as a safety bleeder.
<p>
It's a simple matter to drive PZT CON with a triangle wave from a
function generator at a convenient frequency to observe the mode
and Zeeman beat frequency behavior in real time without dealing with
silly things like heaters and thermal time constants.  I haven't attempted
to generate a scope display at high speed since I'm not sure how happy the
PZT power supply will be with a hundred Hz control signal and I don't have a
4 channel scope anyhow, which would be desirable to view the two Zeeman
modes, the PZT voltage via PZT MON, the beat frequency (converted to a
voltage), and perhaps the total output power.  But running at 5 to 10
seconds per cycle into a PC data acquisition system is fine.
<p>
To use the HeNe laser tube with an external magnetic field rather than the
axial magnetic field of the HP lasers requires removing it from the
existing magnet assembly.  None of that is needed or wanted, only the
tube.  The waveplates were used to convert circular polarized modes to
linear modes but the transverse Zeeman laser already produces linear modes.
The beam expander just adds an annoyance in terms of requiring the beam
to be precisely centered.  And, the magnet assembly restricts the orientation
of the tube to what it was originally due to the anode connection, but for the
transverse Zeeman laser, the linear polarization axes will want to be
aligned with X and Y.
<p>
It does take a bit of care and effort to gouge
out the rubbery filler compound and RTV silicone sealing the tube to the
magnet but since there are 3 magnets and they can be removed as gouging
progresses, no extraordinary means are required to get at anything.  The
tube is shown in <A HREF="hp5501at.jpg">HP-5501A Laser Tube Removed From
Magnet and Output Optics Assembly</A>.  It could conveniently be used
without the magnets, and could be oriented to align the original polarization
axes with the beam sampler.  A pair of O-rings centers it inside the magnet
when used there.  The beam expander was removed since a narrow beam is easier
to align with the photodiodes.  But the waveplates were retained since they
are needed to convert the circular polarized Zeeman modes to linear polarized
modes, and align them with the X and Y axes.  The bare tube was positioned on
a wooden V-block when used without the magnet.
<p>
For the modes, I used the same polarizing beam sampler from the Transverse
Zeeman Laser Testbed 2, above, which has a polarizing beam splitter and
a pair of silicon photodiodes.  Since the only beam from the
HP laser tube is the main output beam, a non-polarizing beamsplitter was
added to divert part of the beam to the beam sampler and send the rest
to an HP-10780A optical receiver.  Its output, which is the Zeeman beat
frequency logic signal, is applied to the frequency-to-voltage converter.
Four channels of data (X and Y modes, PZT drive voltage, and
beat frequency converted to a voltage, when present) are captured by the DATAQ
data acquisition system on my ancient KIWI laptop.  For the beat frequency
plots, regions where there is no beat at all or where the frequency is way
off scale due to multiple modes are not shown to reduce clutter.  Total
power would also have been nice, but the DATAQ unit only has 4 channels.
<p>
The PZT was driven with a 1.5 kV p-p triangle wave in all cases.  This was
generated by the PZT power supply from an HP-5500C fed a 15 p-p signal from
a Wavetek function generator.  The noise in the PZT drive plots may be due
to the fact that it is the actual PZT MON output of the HV power supply,
which comes from a Hi-Z voltage divider, and no attempt was made to filter
or shield it.  Since the plots of the modes and beat frequency are generally
noise-free, I assume the actual HV is clean it's simply an artifact of the
measurement setup and not actually in the PZT voltage.

 HeNe Laser Tube 1 With Normal Axial Magnetic Field</A> is a plot

 This was done first to confirm that the approach works.  The PZT
 is able to change the cavity length by about 2 FSRs (1 full wavelength
 at 633 nm).  Note the non-uniform size of the mode cycles.  More on
 this below.  The red and blue plots are the normal vertically and

 Note that the mode amplitudes go to zero
 with this tube while the previous one has almost 50 percent power
 at all times.  This isn't entirely surprising given the poor health of Tube 2.
 In addition, the shape of the mode waveforms is closer to
 that of a similar length tube without a magnetic field.  While these

 3 full mode cycles while Tube 1 only goes through a bit more than 2.

 stronger mode has flipped from vertical to horizontal
 and the beat freqency variation is much greater.  This is beginning to
 look similar to what was observed with the SP-088 transverse Zeeman

 dramatically affected by slight changes in magnet location along the
 tube, position of polse, orientation, and just about everything
 else.
<p>
<li><A HREF="hp5501m4.gif">Modes of HP-5501A HeNe Laser Tube 1 With No
 Magnetic Field</A> is the final plot showing
 the same tube with no magnetic field applied.
 I had expected this to have modes like any vanilla
 flavored HeNe laser with a similar cavity length.  But this one is
 peculiar!  When the cavity length is increasing, the dominant mode is
 vertically polarized but when the cavity length is decreasing, the
 dominant mode is horizontally polarized!  It's not the usual behavior
 with alternating H and V modes, but it's not a flipper either.
 The next morning, I turned it on with the same setup and it WAS a pure
 flipper.  And generally, it will behave differently depending on what
 sort of magnetic field was present previously.  So I suspect residual
 magnetism in some ferrous parts inside the tube.  It's probably enough to
 mess up the modes on this tube with a very symmetric internal structure and
 little birefringence with on other influences.  That sounds like an
 explanation, right?  Better than hand waving. :)  Using a CRT
 degausser, the modes could be influenced somewhat, but the demagnetized
 state seems to be that of a perfect flipper.  Switching the coil off
 abruptly (which can magnetize the ferrous parts rather than demagnetize
 them) would sometimes leave it in the opposite polarization, but then
 they would revert back after a few cycles.  The mode shape is always
 the same but the polarization is extremely sensitive to the residual
 magnetic field.
</ul>
<p>
The only problem with this setup is that the response of the PZT in
the tube seems to have significant hysteresis.  As the voltage
increases, the first part is stretched and likewise when the voltage
decreases.  So, the display is compressed and distorted.  It's quite repeatable
so as a practical matter it doesn't make that much difference, but is simply
ugly.  I do not know if this is a characteristic of all these tubes, or just
this sample.  I do not have another healthy tube to check at the moment.
From the plots, it can be seen that the high voltage triangle drive waveform
is reasonably linear and is thus not responsible.  Running at a speed of
10X or 0.1X on the PZT drive doesn't seem to make any significant difference
so it's not an issue of a time constant (electrical or otherwise).  It can
also be seen that despite its larger FSR range, the effect is not as
severe with Tube 2.  The cause could be electrical polarization of the
PZT material itself or something along those lines, but this behavior
does seem strange.
<p>
Of course, this same approach can be used to study the normal (non-Zeeman)
modes of the tube (without any magnets), as well as the axial Zeeman modes
using the original magnet/waveplate assembly (as above), or any number
of variations limited only be one's imagination (and free time).

<h3><A NAME="chnishnl">Intensity Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

Although the schemes described above are directed toward achieving single
frequency stabilized operation of a HeNe laser, they either will provide
intensity stabilization as well (or as a side effect) or can be adapted to
this objective fairly easily.  However, where the only thing desired is a
power output that is constant without regard to frequency or modes, it
is possible to use simple light feedback controlling power supply
current or an external modulator.  This approach would compensate
for output power variations due to mode cycling, small changes in
power due to mirror alignment as the tube warms up, and of course,
any lack of regulation in the power supply.  What it (or the schemes
above) can't do anything about is the high frequency noise inherently
present in a HeNe laser.
<p>
Current control using optical feedback should have a range of at least 15
percent.  Thus, the basic HeNe laser tube must have a power fluctuation
range of less than what results from this.  The relevant specification
would be the "mode sweep percentage" or something like that.  For very
small tubes, it could be as high as 20 percent (no good for our purposes).
So, what you want is a long tube since these have a typical variation of
2 to 5 percent.  What this also means is that this scheme will be able
to intensity stabilize a high power HeNe laser, something not possible
(or at least not very easy) with mode stabilization approaches since the
variation in mode amplitudes or ratios for feedback become much smaller
as the tube length increases.
<p>
An alternative to controlling power supply current is to add an external
modulator at the output of the laser.  There are several types including
acousto-optic, electro-optic, and LCD.  The first two would certainly work
and have adequate bandwidth to deal with the higher frequency amplitude
variations and noise, but may be costly.  An LCD modulator will likely be
limited to 10 to 100 Hz, but this should be adequate for removing the
mode sweep and slow power variations.
<p>
A simple photodiode based feedback scheme should work by controlling current
to the tube via the power supply's regulator.  The specific design of the
power supply will determine whether this is straightforward or even possible.
A linear regulator is probably better for this than a switchmode type (which
adds high frequency ripple of its own).
<p>
The loop response will need to deal with the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Output power increase as the tube warms up.  This is typically in the
 15% to 30% range for red HeNe lasers but could be over 100% for 'other color'
 types.
<p>
<li>Periodic output power fluctuations due to mode cycling as the tube warms
 up (period of a few seconds).  Some tubes may have a longer period cycle as
 well due to competing modes from IR or other lines (not the wavelength of
 the laser).
<p>
<li>Instantaneous response of the output power to current changes.  This will
 be in the same direction as the change assuming the current is set below the
 value for peak output power.
<p>
<li>Delayed response of the output power to current changes (a few seconds to
 minutes).
<p>
<li>Any ripple and/or variation in the (unregulated) HeNe laser power supply
 output.  Using a well filtered and regulated power supply is recommended.
 This is more important for intensity compared to frequency stabilization.
 Finding one that is decent in this respect may be harder than it sounds.
 A low voltage DC input type eliminates one source of ripple - the line
 doubler and filter.  But many have just enough output filtering to be able
 to drive the tube in a stable manner.  If buying new, look for the
 specification on output ripple and noise.  Typical modern switchmode
 HeNe laser power supplies have 1 to 2 percent p-p output ripple specification.
 This will translate into a few tenths of a percent actual variation in the
 laser's output power.  Where the laser has an optimal current at which
 the output power is a maximum, this could be cut approximately in
 half by adjusting the current to that value.  The control loops for
 the intensity stabilized laser probably won't care because their
 badwidth is low.  But there will be that residual variation in
 laser output power.
<p>
 From my experience, common Melles Griot AC input power supplies made
 by Laser Drive like the 05-LPM-902 had very noticeable ripple at both
 the line frequency and switching frequency.  A Laser Drive 314T was
 perhaps slightly better.  Aerotech LSS5s had excessive AC line ripple
 but little switching frequency ripple.
 The 12 VDC input Melles Griot 05-LPM-817 had even worse switching
 frequency ripple.  The best that I've found so far
 is a Coherent DC input power supply also made by Laser Drive, probably some
 version of the 180T.  The current and voltage specifications are
 equivalent to those of the Melles Griot 05-LPM-824.  Since the input
 is DC, there is no line frequency ripple.  There is still some output
 ripple but only barely visible at about 0.1 to 0.2 percent p-p of the total
 output power for the particular laser being tested.  A good linear
 power supply might also work if its input filter is beefed up and the
 starter multiplier has a large resistor in series with its input
 (e.g., 10M) since that adds ripple as well.  An unmodified SP-256 had
 excessive line frequency ripple.
<p>
 Also, when setting up components, locate the switchmode (brick) HeNe laser
 power supply (if used) well away from the laser tube and
 electronics.  It's orientation will also make a difference.
 The switching noise can couple into the low level circuitry
 and there may even be feedback to the power supply.  Been there,
 done that.  You'd expect it not to matter but it does. :)  Simply
 repositioning the components resulted in an order of magnitude change
 in the p-p ripple in the optical power.
</ul>
<p>
These are similar to the requirements for light feedback in ion lasers.  Some
of these use fairly fancy loop filters though it would appear that this is not
really needed under most conditions.  I would suggest starting with simple
proportional feedback to get the system to be stable, then add some integral
feedback to reduce the residual error, and finally some differential feedback
to see if higher frequency noise can be reduced.
<p>
The upper and lower limits on the current must be clamped between a value less
than the current for maximum output power at the high-end and well above the
point where the tube drops out and restarts at the low-end.
<p>
An external modulator is potentially simpler and eliminates issues of
power supply melt-downs from design errors. :)  But, a polarized laser
may be required depending on the specific type.

<h4><A NAME="chnishnl1">Sam's Intensity Stabilized HeNe Laser Using External Modulator</A></h4>

An LCD-based variable attenuator or low speed modulator has been
showing up on eBay from <A HREF="http://www.mi-lasers.com/">Meredith
Instruments</A> (eBay ID: mi-lasers).  So, I decided to see how well
this would work as an amplitude stabilizer for a low power polarized
red HeNe laser.  The main objective here is to minimize the power
variation due to mode sweep.  Since the bandwidth of the LCD is limited,
nothing can be done about high frequency noise with this approach.
<p>
A photo of the module is shown in <A HREF="attentr1.jpg">LCD-Based
Variable Attenuator</A>.  The LCD panel is in the large black square
thing.  (Note that I don't know for sure that the active element is an
LCD, only from appearance and behavior.)  To the right of it is a weak
cylindrical lens which can be popped off if not desired.  (At close
range it doesn't make much difference in the beam, but it does reduce
the power slightly.)  The black plastic cylinder contains a
dielectric-coated plate at a steep angle which acts as both a
polarizer and a filter that passes red/orange and blocks green and
beyond (and maybe yellow).  This is followed by a beamsplitter plate
near the Brewster angle and aligned with the polarizer so that only a
very small amount (order of 1 percent) of the beam is directed toward
a silicon photodiode.  For some reason, there is also a piece of sheet
polarizer oriented the same way just in front of the photodiode.  (I
eventually removed it because with that low a percentage of sampled
power, every photon counts!)
<p>
Applying a low voltage (0 to 5 V typical) causes the LCD to change the
polarization of the incident beam.  With the polarizer and beam
sampler oriented at 45 degrees as shown in the photos, it will switch
between a pass or block state with up to a 50:1 extinction ratio 
by applying 0 to 3 V.  The phase (i.e., 0 V is pass or blocked)
will depend on whether the input beam polarization is vertical or horizontal.
However, it's not a pure rotation, as orienting the polarizer at other
than 45 degrees results in a lower extinction ratio.
And, the response is not even remotely linear with
voltage and the LCD response drifts with applied voltage over time.
While applying 3 V will cause the the state to change, only a 0.5 V or
so range results in nearly all the action between roughly 2 and 2.5 V
initially, drifting up with time.  In other words, if 2.2 V results in
a given transmission, it will be necessary to gradually increase the
voltage to maintain the same transmission.  The drift will be evident
in seconds but may take an hour or more to change the required input
by a couple of volts.
<p>
For my stabilized laser, an Aerotech OEM1P polarized laser head
(actual output power about 1.8 mW after warmup) and the attenuator
were mounted on a metal baseplate.  The input needs to be polarized and
this laser makes a good candidate for amplitude stabilization.  It
is short enough to have a large mode sweep resulting in annoying
power variations with warmup.  The attenuator was positioned to
center the beam and aligned in X just slightly offset to minimize
backreflections.  The laser head and the attenuator's polarizer/beam
sampler were both oriented with the polarization vertical (rather than
the 45 degree setting shown in the photos above).  A photo of the setup
is shown in <A HREF="seashl1.jpg">Sam's Externally Amplitude Stabilized
HeNe Laser 1</A>.  A cover over the beam sampler was removed for the
photo, but is needed to prevent ambient light from overwealming the
relatively weak photodiode signal.
<p>
With no voltage applied, the attenuation is about 70 percent, so the
transmission is about 30 percent.  Increasing voltage from 0 V results
in the transmission increasing, then decreasing, then increasing
asymptotically to a maximum beyond which the voltage has negligible
effect.  I decided to use the portion of the response near that end.
The circuit includes a bias adjust pot.  So it is set so the operating
point of the LCD is beyond the minimum transmission point where it is
nearing its max.  If it were desired to have a different output polarization
orientation, the bias would need to change to adjust the operating point.
<p>
The circuit is shown in <A HREF="sgas1sch.pdf">Sam's Laser Amplitude
Stabilizer 1 (SG-AS1)</A>.
It consists of a network for the photodiode with a pot (PSet)
to set the desired output power level, an op-amp unity gain
buffer, and a PID (Proportional/Integral/Differential) Error AMP op-amp stage
for the control loop.  The op-amp is the common LM358.  A CMOS
rail-rail op-amp would be better but this was one was the first to
fall out of my analog junk drawer. :)  The values
of the feedback resistors and capacitors were carefully chosen at
random to result in satisfactory behavior. :)  More careful selection
and/or (gasp!) modeling and simulation of the overall system behavior
could be useful.  The PID Error Amp applies its
output to one of the LCD inputs though a voltage divider which allows the
gain to be adjusted.  The other LCD input gets the fixed bias voltage.
(I don't know how polarity affects the LCD behavior.  I just used the
same polarity as in my initial experiments.  Why complicate life!)
<p>
Note that component values for R3 and R4 were selected based on the
beam sampler percentage and laser power.
<p>
The bandwidth of the LCD is not very high - 10 to 20 Hz or so based on
some simple tests with a function generator.  So, playing with the PID
parameters would be desirable to optimize loop response, especially
when the laser is just turned on and the mode sweep is fastest.  The
circuit generally works quite well, reducing the amplitude of the mode
sweep variation by at least a factor of 50, to 1 &micro;W or less for a 1 mW
output from a 1.8 mW laser.  It locks within a few seconds of power-on
- once the laser's output power has sufficient headroom compared to
the set-point power.  (Much of the difference between the 1.8 mW of
the laser after warmup and the 1 mW output selected for these experiments
is due to losses in reflections from optical surfaces, the
polarizer, and the fact that I didn't try setting it higher!)
<p>
The main problem though is the drift of the LCD.  I doubt this could
run continuously (as in days) even with careful management of the gain
and bias settings.  I also don't know whether the LCD itself likes to
see a nearly constant DC voltage across it continuously.  But so far,
after testing for many hours on and off, the LCD hasn't seemed to
change behavior in any obvious way.
<p>
While the LCD drift doesn't show up in the output since the main feedback
loop is an integrator, there is another slow drift which may be due to
very small changes in the beam pointing of the HeNe laser head.  The beam
sampler appears to be very sensitive to this.  I would recommend replacing the
original polarizer and beam sampler with a Polarizing BeamSplitter
Cube (PBSC) followed by an angled plate at 90 degrees to the polarization
orientation or 5 or 10 percent beamsplitter so that it deflects a higher
percentage of light to the photodiode which is less sensitive to changes
in reflection at the critical Brewster angle as well as from specks of
dust or contamination on the surface.  The slight sacrifice in
output from the beam sampler would probably be more than offset by the
increased transmission of the PBSC and would be worth it in any case to
have more stable long term behavior.  And, without the red filtering effect
of the original plate polarizer, the system could probably be used with
shorter wavelength lasers.
