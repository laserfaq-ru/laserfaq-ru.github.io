<h2>Introduction, Acknowledgement, Ar/Kr Ion Laser Safety</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argiak0">Introduction to Ion Lasers</A></h3>

Argon and krypton (rare gas) ion lasers find applications in many diverse
fields including (1) very high performance printing, copying, scanning,
typesetting, photoplotting, and image generation; (2) forensic medicine,
general and ophthalmic surgery; (3) entertainment; (4) holography; (5)
electrooptics research; and (6) as an optical 'pumping' source for other
lasers.  From the hobbyist's point of view, items (3) and (4) are generally
the most important (aside from the pure project value of such higher power
lasers).  However, common sources for these lasers when they show up on the
surplus market are mostly from (1).
<p>
Note: For the purposes of this discussion, argon ion and krypton ion lasers
are very similar - they are both rare gas ion lasers, their basic principles
of operation are similar, and the same basic hardware configuration and power
supplies can usually be used.  Differences are primarily in gas fill of the
plasma tube and the mirrors/prisms for selecting the output wavelength.  Keep
this in mind since where we describe something for an argon ion laser, most
likely it applies to a krypton ion (or mixed gas 'white light') laser as well.
However, this doesn't mean you can just replace one type with another or
convert an argon ion laser to krypton by cracking open the seal on its tube
and refilling it!  For more information, see the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtsa9">Comparison of Argon and Krypton Ion Tube
Characteristics</A> and the chapter: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion
Laser Power Supplies</A>.
<p>
These are the types of lasers generally used for large scale light shows as
well as in some types of high performance phototypesetters or other digital
imagers, and for use in holography and other optics research.  Unlike diode
and HeNe types, a serious interest in these also represents a very serious
investment of time, money, and caution.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argon ion lasers are not of the 'set it and forget it' variety.  At least,
  not those even a financially independent hobbyist can afford.  They require
  a certain amount of maintenance and fiddling to achieve optimal output
  power and maximize tube life (though this is much less of an issue with
  internal mirror tubes).
<p>
<li>The basic tubes are costly - even reconditioned ones with many hours
  already on them.  Expect to spend several hundred dollars for one that is
  not even anywhere near to new or in tip-top condition.  A new tube may go
  for $5,000 or more - just for the tube!
<p>
<li>The power supply will be even more costly (possibly $1,000 or more used)
  unless you build it yourself since while refurb tubes are available, power
  supplies don't really wear out so they are in much shorter supply.
</ul>
If you are totally unfamiliar with ion laser technology - or you are just
curious - it might be worth checking out the sections:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argiak3">On-line Introductions to Argon Ion Lasers</A>
and <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argbcs8">More Information on Argon/Krypton Ion
Lasers</A> before.

<h3><A NAME="argiak1">Equipment Using Argon Ion Lasers</A></h3>

As noted, argon and krypton ion lasers are used for many applications.  Large
water-cooled units (like the various Lexel models) with up to several WATTs of
output power were often medical or surgical lasers.  While locating one of
these in working or even repairable condition at a good price might be your
fantasy (it is mine), consider that such a beast will require at least 220 VAC
(some use 440 VAC!) and possibly three-phase power, a tap water connection, and
likely a fair amount of tinkering (and possibly cost as well) to get it going
and keep it going.  While your local electric company will probably be willing
and eager to sell you all those kWHs, you may need a large phase converter
to convert your residential single-phase
power to three-phase or an upgrade your power feed (which may or may not be
costly).  Here are a couple of links to possible designs:
<p>

 to Three Phase Convertor Info</A>
<li><A HREF=
 "http://www.LaserFX.com/Backstage.LaserFX.com/Hobby/PhaseConvert.html">LaserFX
  Hobby Archives - Phase Converter</A>
</ul>
<p>
At least the added plumbing shouldn't be much of a problem unless
portability is an important consideration!  This is not to say it cannot be
done, just that you will have to be pretty determined to get that large laser
going in an one-bedroom apartment!  In any case, you can't just go and plug
one of these beasts into the nearest AC outlet. :)
<p>
A small air-cooled ion laser is probably a more reasonable toy especially if
you have to share the single 3-prong outlet in your place with the family
microwave! :-)  And, some of these lasers still have outputs that can approach
500 mW (though most are much lower).
<p>
The types of small argon ion (krypton ion types would be rare) lasers that are
turning up on the surplus market are often from various high performance
scanners, recorders, duplicators (not your ordinary office copier), printers,
and phototypesetters.
<p>
The Xerox 9700 series and older 8700 series (and possibly the 8400 as well)
utilized an American Laser Corporation (ALC) 60X argon ion laser.  This laser
was made to the Xerox "X" standard for a high speed duplicator/printer, hence
the X in the part number.  The NEC-3030 is also a printer laser and OEM
Spectra-Physics (SP) 161 lasers were used in a Times Graphics, Inc. printer.
The IBM model 3900, 3835, and 3825 printers (circa 1996) have argon ion lasers
and AOMs.  Other companies that manufacture or have manufactured equipment
containing ion lasers include Dainippon Screens, Hell, and Ricoh.
<p>
Many of these older but expensive graphic arts systems are still being
maintained and are now being retrofitted with newer technology such as high
power IR diode lasers or Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) lasers.  Therefore,
more small air-cooled argon (mostly) ion laser heads and power supplies are
showing up on the surplus market at attractive prices.  (However, if you would
be content with only 532 nm green, there are high quality DPSS
lasers showing up surplus from these sources as well.  The most common is
the Coherent Compass 315M-100 which produces a TEM00 beam with an output
power of up to 100 mW.  However, red and blue DPSS lasers are still way
too expensive for most hobbyists.  For more information, see the chapter:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssltoc">Solid State Lasers</A>.)
<p>
Some DNA sequencers apparently also contain argon ion and other medium
power visible lasers.
<p>
For reference, here are the typical wavelengths and expected power output from
argon ion laser heads pulled from graphics arts equipment:
<p>
<ul>
<li>ALC-60X (external mirrors): 488 nm or 514 nm (20 to 40 mW), or multiline
 (retunable to much higher power).
<p>
<li>NEC-3030 (internal mirrors): 488 nm (20 to 30 mW).  There are a few
  multiline NEC-3030s but check with a grating to be sure.  Some of these
  heads were rebuilt with 3050 tubes.
<p>
<li>SP-161 (internal or external mirrors): 488 nm or 514 nm (15 to 20 mW), or
  multiline (up to 40 mW).
</ul>
<p>
Other argon ion lasers that may turn up as pulls from graphic arts equipment
include the Uniphase 2202-5BLT, 2202-30BLT, and Spectra-Physics 163, as well
as several others.
<p>
Note that some lasers that at first appear to have excellent specs may be
designed for pulsed (low duty cycle) operation.  One example is the HGM
Spectrum Compac A Argon Laser.  This uses a American Laser 68B tube which
would be good for 2.5 W with a proper power supply and adequate cooling but
in this case is only designed for relatively low duty cycle pulsed operation.
Pulse, cool, pulse, cool, etc.  If the price is low enough, it may be worth
buying just for the tube (assuming it is still good) but non-trivial
modifications will likely be needed for it to run CW.
<p>
Additional more detailed information on many of these and other models from
ALC, NEC, and SP can be found later in this and subsequent chapters on ion
lasers.  Also see the section: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpsnsw10">How to Get a
Laser Without Really Trying - Part 2</A>.
<p>
However, many older laser printers and related equipment were based on HeNe
lasers so don't assume there is an argon ion laser in that dusty thing at the
salvage yard (even if quite large) just because it has a laser warning label!
(Newer consumer/office type laser printers use relatively low power IR diode
lasers.)
<p>
Mike Harrison (mike@whitewing.co.uk) has a Web page in the early stages of
development which lists graphic arts, industrial, medical, scientific, and
other equipment which include internal lasers of all kinds.  The page can
be updated with your contributions as well.  Take the link near the bottom
of <A HREF="http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/">Mike's Electric
Stuff Page</A> (which also has a lot of other interesting topics).
<p>
Here are some guidelines for determining if dragging home something bigger
than your living room will be worth the trouble:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Look for a laser safety sticker.  While most will say "Class I" because
 the laser beam is usually totally blocked from getting out, there may be
 a mention of wavelength(s).  Look for obvious argon ion (most often 488 nm
 or 514 nm for graphic arts equipment) or other laser wavelengths.
<p>
<li>Find the power requirements label.  If the equipment only uses 5 A at
 115 VAC, it likely doesn't have an ion laser in it.  A 10 A rating would
 be marginal after accounting for the motors and electronics.  Look for
 large air inlets and ducted cooling fans.
<p>
<li>For high performance graphics "imagesetters", it may be possible to
 identify the type of laser by looking up the recommended type of media it
 uses.  Note that these aren't copiers but more like super fancy laserprinters
 and are likely to weigh several <i>TONS</i> (fortunately they may be in
 sections and on wheels!).
</ul>

<p>
Some of the higher-end stuff from Xerox, ECRM, still have HeNe's in them.
The Xerox printers are the kind of machines you'd find at places like Kinko's.
(big, expensive ones).  Xerox still services some argon ion based units too.
<p>
Xerox just yanks the laser heads out after a certain number of operating
hours and, last I knew, sells them off on the surplus market.  The HeNe's
that come out still have quite a few operating hours left in them at that
point.  For awhile MWK had first dibbs on them, but I don't know what's
happening in the last year or two.
<p>
(From: Dean Glassburn (Dean@niteliteproducts.com).)
<p>
Basically here is the story on Amercian Laser's Lasers.  ALC has sold 60X,
68B, 909, and 920 systems in the past.  The 60X was used in Xerox graphic
arts machines, the 68B, 909, and 920 in medical systems.  All these
manufactures of the systems that used the tubes have since either gone out
of business or found other technology to replace the ion laser systems (e.g.,
high power diode and DPSS lasers).
<p>
About two years ago, ALC's main source of BeO went out of business.  Not a
major disaster to ALC, because their replacement of those tube types were
about 10 a year combined for the 909 and 68B.  Ceramic for the 920 was all
gone as well as the need for that tube. The current situation is that to get
a new tube manufactured there is a 6 to 10 week wait and the cost for the
ceramic is twice what it once was, so the tube price new is much higher.
<p>
OK that is the current situation. We have sold and rebuilt many ALC systems
for use, but the new tube issue always eventually comes up.
<p>
The benefits to using these are easy to state: Usually you can find these
cheaper than other systems.  When working properly, the systems put out good
power as designed.
<p>
The design limitations are as follows. The 60X was originally designed for 7
to 9 A tube running 488 nm TEM00. This equates to a maximum of 20 mW for 8,000
hours.  However, all the 60X systems currently out there are usually old tubes
running at a MUCH higher current.  To get a higher output of 50 to 100 mw, tube
life is very limited.  The 909 systems deliver about 5 to 6 watts
multimode/multiline. Not the best divergence but not bad either.  No fill
system on the tube, so life is about 1,000 to 2,500 hours.  We have regassed
plenty of these and kept them running.  As a krypton or mixed gas, life
around 600 hours is normal.  We usually leave a valve on the tube for
regassing.  The 68B tubes are usually cracked and cannot be repaired, or run
at a low pressure and carbon tracked the bypass.  The 920 made a lot of
power when running, but it was designed to pump into a Dye laser or a fiber.
It is a big bore tube to operate on three-phase 208 VAC at 45 amps, good for
about 1,000 hours.  You would have better divergence with a flashlight.
Changing the optics to reduce the divergence makes a 6 watt, 45 amp laser
instead of a 14 watt high divergence laser.  Better off with a 909, same
output, less power consumed.

<h3><A NAME="argiak1a">Mix and Match Ion Laser Components</A></h3>

When you obtain a laser that spent its former life as part of a fancy graphics
arts machine (or from other sources as well for that matter), it may turn out
to be composed of pieces from several manufacturers as parts were replaced or
upgraded.  Don't panic!  For better or for worse, this implies a high level
of interchangeability among similar size lasers and the availability of
replacements and substitute components.  In fact, such a hybrid or may be
better than the original because at least some of its parts will likely be
newer than the original as they were replaced to provide an improvement in
performance or life expectancy.  The downside is finding documentation on a
half dozen different pieces from several manufacturers!
<p>
However, a word of caution: Just because the connectors look the same or the
specs look like the power supply and laser head should be compatible doesn't
make it so.  Just plugging something together may result in smoke or shortened
lifetime.  It is a safe bet that if the components actually came from a working
system, they will play happily together.  On the other hand, if someone just
connected a power supply to a laser head that it wasn't designed to drive,
tested the combination for a couple of minutes, and sold it as a working
system, there could be problems down the road.
<p>
Regardless of whether your laser is built like Frankenstein's monster, it WILL
likely be missing the cooling fan and in some cases, even the head cover.  The
typical Patriot style fans are available surplus typically for between $15 and
$30.  Other type fans or blowers with similar ratings (220 cfm and up) will
also work if the airflow direction is correct (i.e., for the ALC-60X, it must
be sucking out of the head).  In cases where the fan diameter is much larger
than the opening in the head above the tube as with the Patriot and ALC-60X,
a 1 inch collar will also be needed between them to act as an adapter plenum.
For laser heads like the SP-161 where the cover may be missing, replacements
(including the fan) may be available from the original manufacturer or
companies like <A HREF="http://www.nationallaser.com/">National Laser</A>.
though the cost may be a good
fraction of what you paid for the entire laser!  (In the case of the SP-161,
the cover is really only needed for safety - the fan doesn't use the cover for
mounting.)  But, if you are just a bit handy, they can usually be fabricated
relatively easily.  Any interlocks that are missing will also need to be
replaced.  I've even heard of people using vacuum cleaners for cooling
ion lasers!  (Think of the marketing possibilities!)
<p>
Also, don't be upset if the running time meter says something like 64,500
hours!  This is typical of a graphic arts pull and doesn't reflect on how much
time is on the tube itself - which is the only thing that really matters.  You
can be sure the tube has been replaced more than once but there is probably no
way to actually determine how many hours are on the one that is installed.
<p>
Where the umbilical cable has been cut (this happens as well since whoever
removed the unit may not have realized that the cable could be extracated
non-destructively), a proper connector will need to be reattached.  If they
are the same type at both ends, the wiring is likely 1:1 so an ohmmeter can be
used to determine the connections.   However, if they are not the same type
(e.g., a Jones type at one end and an AMP type at the other), you will need to
find the wiring for each one.  Ditto if either end is hard-wired.  However, in
the worst case, a lot of the wiring at the head-end at least can be determined
by tracing connections inside the head.  WARNING: A cut umbiliacal could also
mean there could be compatibility problems as mentioned above if the head and
power supply were not from the same piece of equipment and were never tested
together.  Even if they use the same AMP connector, there could still be
problems.  For example, an ALC or Omni power supply may melt down attempting
to drive an NEC head or vice-versa without some rewiring and other changes
(if it is even possible) even though the connectors mate.

<h3><A NAME="argiak4">Acknowledgement for Ar/Kr Ion Laser Information</A></h3>

Much of the material on argon and krypton ion lasers has been provided in one
form or another by Steve Roberts
(<a href="mailto:osteven@akrobiz.com">osteven@akrobiz.com</a>) via direct
contribution of text and photos and via email discussions.  Many thanks to
Steve for making this material available.

<h3><A NAME="argiak5">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Safety</A></h3>

It is not possible to over-emphasize the hazards involved in working with
argon ion lasers.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The laser itself emits at 10s to 100s of mW or more in a collimated beam
  instantly damaging to vision.  These probably will not start a fire (at
  least not from the beam itself) but can scorch wood or other materials if
  even moderately focused.  They are all at least Class IIIb and some are
  Class IV lasers.
<p>
<li>The power supply is very often line-connected and operates at around 100 V
  with many AMPs of current available for the laser tube or for a nice path
  through you unsuspecting body.  The igniter (starting circuit - aptly named)
  isn't something you want to come in contact with either.  This isn't like
  a little HeNe power supply.
<p>
<li>The current in the filament and anode wiring and connectors is quite high -
  up to 25 <b>AMPs</b> or more even for a small air-cooled ion laser.
  Therefore, the wiring must be of adequate capacity and the male and female
  pins of the umbilical connectors must be clean and snug or else there will
  be a meltdown or worse.  I've heard of these things catching fire due to
  heating at high resistance connections.  Periodically inspect the pins for
  discoloring (from overheating) and fatigue, and replace any that are
  suspect.  (Squeezing the female pin to make better contact may work
  temporarily but once overheating has occurred, the springiness is gone and
  this is risky as a long term cure.)  For home-built systems, I would
  recommend using multiple pins for the high current signals even if the
  connector manufacturer's spec sheet suggests that a single pin should be
  adequate.
</ul>
<p>
Having said that, argon ion lasers represent the Holy Grail for laser
enthusiasts who will likely turn up their collective noses at HeNe lasers
once they have become hooked.

<h3><A NAME="argiak6">Additional Comments on Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Safety</A></h3>

Safety is a major concern, as these are HV high current devices. The major
hazard is instant eye damage, and although you can slightly burn certain
materials such as black thermoplastic, these are not burning and cutting
lasers even when focused, and walls don't burst into flame when the beam hits
them. The tubes are usually made of beryllium oxide, kovar and copper (though
there are a few quartz ones out there as well).  There is a hazard if the BeO
ceramic is ground or powdered and inhaled, and most people who buy one don't
know about that.  (But then, if you are grinding the tube, you don't have a
working laser anymore.  However, keep this in mind should you come across a
certifiably dead argon/krypton tube and become overly curious.)
<p>
I'm sure you've seen the posts on the sci.optics or alt.lasers newsgroups that
go something like: "I just got a big laser.  What type is it?  What can I do
with it?  Etc."  One of these guys is going to look down the bore and get
blinded or worse.  So I'd also like to see a site up for that reason. Well
it turns out there is such a site.  There is a excellent laser safety site at:

<h2>Basic Characteristics, Other Information Sources</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argbcs0">Basic Characteristics of 'Small' Argon Ion
 Lasers</A></h3>

WARNING:  These are in a whole different league (compared to common diode and
helium-neon lasers) with respect to safety hazards as the optical power levels
involved are generally much higher (20 mW to many WATTS - Class IIIb and Class
IV) and the power supplies are more dangerous as well.  There is no margin for
error in dealing with either the operating laser or its power supply.
<p>
Note: Since comparisons are made throughout this discussion between argon (and
krypton) ion lasers and helium-neon (HeNe) lasers, it is worthwhile to first
read the Chapter: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoc">Helium-Neon Lasers</A> if you
are not familiar with those devices.
<p>
The basic design of the argon/krypton laser is conceptually similar to that of
the HeNe (or other gas) laser - plasma tube containing the active medium (argon
and/or krypton gas) mirrors forming a Fabry-Perot resonator.  However, unlike
HeNe lasers, the energy level transitions that contribute to laser action come
from ions of argon or krypton - atoms that have had 1 or 2 electrons stripped
from their outer shells.  Spectral lines at wavelengths less than 400 nm come
from atoms that have had 2 electrons removed.  Longer wavelengths come from
singly ionized atoms.  There are many possible transitions in the UV, visible,
and IR portions of the spectrum.  With suitable optics coherent light from a
single spectral line or many lines may be produced simultaneously.  An
adjustable intra-cavity prism can even be included to permit the desired
wavelength to be selected via a thumb-screw adjustment.
<p>
Beam characteristics in terms of diameter and divergence are similar to those
of HeNe lasers.  However, the coherence length (without additional optics)
tends to be smaller than that of a HeNe laser of similar cavity length.  This
is because the gain curve for the ion laser transitions is wider than
the one for the HeNe laser - around 2.5 GHz compared to 1.5 GHz.  So,
a larger number of longitudinal modes will be present and the coherence
length will therefore be reduced.  Coherence lengths quoted by various
sources range from 2.5 to 10 cm for typical air-cooled ion lasers.
<p>
To excite the ionic transitions and achieve a population inversion, much more
current is needed than for a HeNe laser.  A 'small' argon laser may use 10
AMPs of current (rather than the 3 to 8 mA typical of a HeNe laser tube).
Even at a tube voltage of 100 VDC, this represents about 1000 W of power
dissipation.  (Think of a typical space heater inside a small box!)  High flow
rate forced air cooling is absolutely essential - the tube would melt down in
short order without it.  Larger ion laser tubes may pass more than 100 AMPs of
current at up to 400 VDC or more - and require three-phase power and water
cooling - figure on utility substation just for your laser!
<p>
Thus, while Ar/Kr ion lasers and HeNe lasers are conceptually similar, the
approximately 3 orders of magnitude greater tube current and two orders of
magnitude greater power dissipation compared to a HeNe laser mean that the
construction details are vastly different.  You won't find one of these in a
laser pointer!
<p>
See <A HREF="cutube3.gif">Typical Cyonics Air-Cooled Argon Ion Laser Tube</A>
for the construction of one popular internal mirror type (which bears the most
similarity to a HeNe laser tube)!  Those from other manufacturers are similar.

<h3><A NAME="argbcs1">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Tube Electrical Characteristics</A></h3>

Both HeNe and Ar/Kr ion tubes use a gas discharge in a narrow capillary bore
to excite the laser medium to upper energy states, they both need a starting
pulse to overcome the initially non-conducting gas, and a current controlled
power supply to regulate the discharge.   However, the similarities pretty
much end there.
<p>
The following assumes a small air-cooled Ar/Kr ion tube like that used in the
American Laser Corporation 60X/Omnichrome 532 or the Cyonics tube described in
the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrctt0">Cyonics Argon Ion Tube</A>.
<ul>
<li>The operating current is measured in AMPS for even the smallest air-cooled
  Ar/Kr ion tubes.  Typical useful current range for these tubes is 3 to 10 A.
<p>
  Only a few modern air cooled tubes stand up to 12 A and most models peak out
  at 10 A, despite what Omnichrome says in their documents.  The tubes will
  invariably come with a 10 A limit sticker.  As far as I'm aware, no
  application ever used the 'special modifications' for 14 A for the
  Omnichrome 532, these special modifications are going to a tube that is
  twice as long with 2 huge fans, which is actually the next model up, the
  543.
<p>
  Also see the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrtle0">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser
  Tube Life</A>.
<p>
<li>The voltage drop across the tube is usually between 100 and 110 VDC
  (though some may be as low as 85 VDC).
<p>
  Unlike a HeNe tube, the Ar/Kr ion discharge may not present a large negative
  resistance once the arc has been struck.  Some references suggest that the
  effective series resistance is on the order of 1 or 2 ohms positive while
  others indicate that it is a low negative value (or perhaps it depends on the
  particular tube design and operating conditions).  In any case, the tube
  behaves so much like a dead short that without a regulator or some additional
  ballast resistance, this argument may be only of academic interest!
<p>
  If the resistance is positive, tube current can theoretically be controlled
  by varying the voltage of the supply and a ballast resistor isn't strictly
  essential as with an HeNe tube just to maintain stability.  However, this
  control would be extremely sensitive to EVERYTHING since a small change in
  input voltage would result in a large change in current.  For example,
  assuming the effective discharge resistance is 1 ohm for a tube dropping 100
  V at 10 A, a 5 percent variation in input voltage would result in more than
  a 50 percent change in tube current!  Furthermore, due to changing conditions
  as the tube heats, a runaway condition is possible even if the resistance of
  the discharge is non-negative and must be avoided by using a proper current
  regulator (or adequate ballast resistance - for testing only).
<p>
<li>A starting voltage of up to 10 kV is required to initiate the discharge.
  This is very similar to the needs of a HeNe tube but since the operating
  current is much higher, options for the starter design are very limited.
<p>
<li>Ar/Kr ion tubes use a heated filament instead of a cold cathode.  This
  typically requires between 15 and 25 A at 2.5 to 3 V (AC is acceptable).
<p>
<li>Forced air cooling MUST be provided for continuous operation (more than a
  few seconds - the tube is dissipating the equivalent of a space heater!).
  Certain Omnichrome tubes, mainly the hotter ones, have clamp-on aluminum
  blocks for cooling.  These are held on with springs and 4 Allen head screws,
  and get a thick layer of silicon heat sink grease. You can tell the
  difference - these will have fins all across the air space in the top of the
  head while the more common ALC, Cyonics, and lower power Omni tubes have
  fins with a hollow box around the bore.  The airflow is usually set up
  such that the fan sucks in air through the tube fin assembly via the case
  and blows it out the top.
<p>
  In any case, if you acquired a head that is missing the HUGE fan - don't be
  tempted to run it until you have one in place and spinning up a storm (at
  least not for more than 30 seconds)!  Sit a vacuum cleaner on top if you
  have to but don't skip the cooling!
</ul>
<p>
Large frame Ar/Kr lasers may require 35 A at 400 V running on three-phase 240
VAC, 30 kV or more to start, and gallons-per-minute of tap water cooling!

<h3><A NAME="argbcs2">Why Does an Ion Laser Tube use a Heated Cathode?</A></h3>

Modern HeNe lasers usually use cold cathodes (some older ones DID use the
heated variety).  What about ion lasers?  You could save a lot of weight if
there was no filament transformer, right?
<p>
Think of how much larger the cathode of a HeNe tube is compared to the anode.
That much surface area is needed to keep the heating and sputtering at the
cathode within acceptable limits.  (An HeNe tube WILL lase if hooked up
backwards but its life will be significantly shortened.)  And that is for a
tube using only a few watts compared to a KILOWATT or more for an ion laser.
<p>
The typical ion tube has a thick helix of tungsten for its cathode (calling
it a 'filament' is really minizing the massive nature of this structure!).
The hot cathode results in thermionic emission (the boiling off of electrons
from its surface) reducing its work function - the potential (voltage) drop
associated with pulling an electron out and away from it to free space.  With
less voltage drop, less power is dissipated at the cathode itself, there is
less damage and less sputtering, as well as a reduced voltage requirement for
the power supply.  Also see the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argmlh1a">Effects of Improper Filament Temperature</A>.
<p>
Also note that the cathode isn't just made out of metallic tungsten - it is
specially processed and coated to promote the formation of an sufficiently
dense electron cloud so that AMPS of current can be passed through the tube
with minimal additional heating at the cathode itself.  The AC of the filament
supply keeps arc moving in the vicinity of the cathode  Even so, if conditions
aren't perfect, you can end up with localized heating leading to cathode sag
and eventual failure.  Repeated attempts at starting, improper gas pressure,
contamination, and plasma oscillations can result in erosion of the cathode.
An ion tube with a cathode that is not hot enough won't start.  One that loses
its filament supply during operation will go out - and there may be damage to
the cathode in the process.
<p>
All in all, what you would gain in not needing a filament transformer, you
would lose in having to have a truly HUGE cathode structure to handle the heat
dissipation, a much HIGHER voltage power supply, even better then perfect
cooling, etc.  :-)

<h3><A NAME="argbcs3">Ion Laser Bore Temperature, Materials, and BeO
 Warning</A></h3>

The plasma temperature is hotter then the surface of the sun, way up there.
For large tubes like the Lexel-88, there is a magnetic field to push it away
from the bore walls.  You loose the magnet, you rapidly damage the tube.  Most
lasers actually use tungsten disks to form the bore and then have the tungsten
mounted in copper blocks that spread the heat out over a large area so the
water can cool the tube.  The plasma is about 1,500 to 2,000 &deg;C, plus it
is extremely energetic.  When a gas is torn apart like that and given that kind
of energy, it acts like a very strong acid and will attack the tube lining.
<p>
This arc temp is well above what would melt glass.  There are only 5 or 6
materials that can go into a argon plasma tube and survive the arc: BeO,
tungsten, aluminum nitride, pyrolytic graphite and molybdenum. Even the
NEC-3030 which has a glass outer bottle, has a BeO tube fused on to handle
the plasma and conduct away the heat.  If you put enough current through the
bore, you get additional wavelengths as the sodium, oxygen. barium, and
who knows what else ions start to lase with the argon.  Tube materials lasing
is not something you want to see despite how pretty it might look. :-)  Tubes
(and possibly power supplies) don't last long when this happens!
<p>
Keep in mind that even the old quartz plasma tubes have beryllium oxide or
tungsten bores, and the glass is NOT in contact with the plasma.  Beryllium
oxide conducts heat 5 times faster then most metals.
<p>
You will NOT be able to purchase BeO as it can be an extremely nasty thing if
mishandled and you breathe the powder. A small but unknown percentage of people
will have their lungs damaged leading to an early death.  If somebody gives
you a old plasma tube made of BeO or containing BeO components, you should
NEVER grind on it, open it, clean it with acid, or breathe the dust it makes
when it breaks.  When they break, they have to be FLOODED with water, and all
the pieces sealed in a plastic bag and sent to a special place for disposal
(there should be precisely this warning on the tube somewhere).  (And, then
you may have to have a Hazmat team come in to clean up your house.)  Don't
mess with it!

<h3><A NAME="argbcs4">How Tube Dimensions (and Other Factors) Affect Output
 Power</A></h3>

In addition to discharge length and bore diameter, the power output of an ion
tube is a function of the pressure and current density required for a stable
arc of a given length.  That's generally proprietary and hard won information,
so here goes what's published and what I can measure. 
<p>
The following were measured with calipers from end-bell to end-bell and
then roughly compensated with eyeball for actual bore length:
<p>
<ul>
<li>110 mW ALC-60X: 3.7 inches.
<li>225 mW Omni-532: 3.4 inches.
<li>350 mW ILT: 4.9 inches (same tube does 40 mW with a krypton fill).
<li>1.5 W Lexel-88: 11 inches.
<li>4 W Lexel-95: 15 inches.
<li>12 W Lexel-295: 18 inches.
</ul>
<p>
Given the overall length of these tube, the relatively short bores may seem
surprising.  The remaining length is taken up with the filament/cathode and
support structure, and gas filled spaces of the cathode and anode end-bells.
<A HREF="cutube3.gif">Typical Cyonics Air-Cooled Argon Ion Laser Tube</A>
where (although the diagram is not totally to scale) the cathode end-bell is
actually longer than the actual bore.
<p>
Bore diameters usually range from .55 to .75 mm for small lasers and up to 2 mm
for large-frames. Longer tubes require larger bores.
<p>
Most of the information below is from the operation manual for a
Spectra-Physics large-frame ion laser.
<p>
The formula for argon output available from a given ion tube operated below 
saturation all lines multimode output is:

<PRE>
                              P = K * (J<sup>2</sup>) * V
</PRE>

Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>P is the output power.
<li>J is the current density in A/cm<sup>2</sup>.
<li>V is the volume of the active region.
<li>K is a magic constant.
</ul>
<p>
Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Visible output saturates at about 800 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.
<li>The gain of most argon visible lines rises with magnetic field to a limit
 of about 1200 G then it rolls over."  
</ol>
<p>
Most lasers in the less then 1 meter class like about 600 Gauss to start.
Too much magnetic field in an ALC-60X type tube, can actually kill power,
as we have found (--- Steve).
<p>
Magnetic fields that envelop the plasma discharge enhances the population
inversion, it tends to force free electrons toward the center of the plasma
tube bore, increasing the probability of a pumping collision, unfortunately 
the magnetic field also causes Zeeman splitting of the laser lines, which
elliptically polarizes the output, causing partial loss at the polarization
sensitive plasma tube windows
<p>
The following equation applies to any laser - not just an ion type.  Output
power can be calculated from:
<PRE>
                                          q * L
                       Po = T * A * I * (------ - 1)
                                          T + B
</PRE>
Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>T is the output coupler (OC) transmission in percent.
 <li>A is the cross sectional area of the beam.
 <li>I is a saturation parameter.
 <li>q is the small signal gain.
 <li>L is the gain length.
 <li>B is the sum of all cavity losses.
 </ul>
<p>
The following are some specific numbers for various lasers (from "Laser
Fundamentals" by William Silfast, ISBN 0-521-55617-1):
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Argon ion: q = .5/m; Typical q * L = .1 to .5; Gain bandwidth = 5 Ghz.
 <li>HeNe: q =.15/m; Typical q * L = 0.03; Gain bandwidth = 1.5 GHz.
 <li>Nd:YAG: q = 10/m; Typical q * L = 2 to 20; Gain bandwith = 170 GHz.
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="arghpil">Higher Power Ion Laser</A></h3>

The unclassified world record holder is a ~2 meter long 30 mm bore tube
running at ~240 A with on the order of 500 watts optical output. The limit
is determined by how well the coatings on the mirrors can hold up.  These
tubes are constructed of oxidized aluminum disks stacked together with O-rings
and are water cooled.  They are actively pumped and leak like a sieve (no
sealed tube), hard to start, and use a cold cathode.
<p>
The basic design is by Dr. Sergei Babin at Novosibersk.  They are
available commercially as one offs at up to 75 watts.  Get yours while
they are hot! :)

<h3><A NAME="argclpi">Compact Low Power Ion Laser?</A></h3>

We all are impressed by HUGE argon ion lasers putting out 20 W or more that
are 6 feet long and require 480 VAC three-phase 50 A service.
<p>
However, what about a really compact air-cooled argon ion laser only capable
of a few mW but made as small as possible?
<p>
The problem no matter how you slice it is power dissipation and the bore
length required to achieve adequate gain.  The smallest commercial argon ion
tubes have bore lengths of a little over 75 mm with a diameter of about .5 mm.
These may have a lasing threshold as low as 2 A at perhaps 85 V across the
tube.  Assuming that such a tube could produce 2 mW at a current of 3 A and
that amount of power is most that will be needed, the power dissipation of the
discharge is reduced to just over 250 W max.  For such a tube:
<ul>
<li>The amount of material used to construct the tube core would be much less
 than that for those like the ALC-60X or Cyonics 2301.
<p>
<li>Smaller heat sink fins and a smaller lower capacity fan would be adequate.
<p>
<li>The physical size and power requirements of the filament/cathode can be
 reduced.
</ul>

This could result in a laser head about the size of a soup can (a cylinder
60 mm in diameter by 125 mm in length) with a fan at one end.  The power
supply would be significantly reduced in size and complexity as well.  I
wonder if such a laser exists?

<h3><A NAME="argasac">About Small Air-Cooled Ion Lasers with Huge Power
 Ratings</A></h3>

Sometimes, ion lasers turn up that are about the size of a typical small
air-cooled unit but have CDRH power ratings of multiple WATTs.  In most
cases, these are lasers designed for low duty cycle applications.  Both the
power supply and cooling will be way underrated for CW operation.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
For CW work, 4 units of 350 cfm Patriot fans for a model 68B, the
HGM5 is an ALC-68B with shortened Brewster stems, a bigger gas ballast, and
a slightly wider bore, it can be 3 watt CW laser, but is usually ran
duty cycled. I have seen ALC-68s do 7 watts on the bench when freshly
made.  The HGM does run about 500 mW CW and can be  pulsed up to 3
watts max for up to say 15 seconds with the existing HGM fan, which is
a big squirrel cage type.
<p>
The warning label is 5 watts on the HGM5, the medical circuitry clips
the power at 3 W.
<p>
If you could cool it enough, an ALC-60X size tube can do 2 to 3 watts
easily, in fact there is a medical unit that uses a small internal
mirror tube at 3 watts using a closed loop water-to-air-cooler 
in a power-on-demand application at a 5% or so duty cycle.  What
limits you on an ALC-60X is the glowing red undercooled anode that will open
up when you try it - spoken from experience, not conjecture. :-)

<h3><A NAME="argbcs7">Other Types of Ion Lasers</A></h3>

While argon and krypton ion lasers are the most well known, there are other
types.  Two of these are xenon ion and oxygen ion (pulsed only) and neon
ion.  They are not super-radient and require cavity optics like Ar/Kr types.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Xenon lases on several green lines with a hot cathode and runs in a pulse
 mode at a very low pressure, too low to sustain a long arc, but still enough
 to sustain a pulsed discharge.  The lasing process is self terminating.  It
 lases mainly in the green with some yellow and blue lines.  Peak power may
 exceed a kW.  The green emission lines at 526, 535.3, and 539.5 nm are the
 strongest.  Xenon ion lasers were used most commonly in precision laser
 resistor trimmers up until SHG YAG technology and excimer lasers took over
 that market.  They are still used for certain scientific uses such as water
 turbitity measurement and non destructive testing.
<p>
<li>Oxygen lases on blue, green, and yellow lines with a cold cathode in a
 tube basically identical to that for Ar/Kr ion lasers.  Oxygen lases in the
 afterglow like mercury.  The journal:
 <A HREF="http://ojps.aip.org/rsio/">Review of Scientific Instruments</A> had
 oxygen ion laser plans about 12 years ago. Oxygen has very high gain.
<p>
<li>Neon ion lasers run CW in the UV but has no practical visible lines.  (Note
 that neon will lase CW on some of the common HeNe lines without helium but
 the gain/efficiency is way down and these are not ionic transitions.)  However
 it has a pulsed line at about 540 nm in the green.  Experimental radon ion
 lasers were once built, but who wants a laser that is reactor pumped and needs 6 feet of lead shielding.
</ul>
<p>
Just about every gaseous element has been shown to lase in the IR and some
cases visible or UV, but few will lase CW. Xenon is used for resistor trimmers
because in its pulsed mode, its green lines are able to be focused tightly,
and its per pass gain is much higher then any other gas laser except copper
vapor resulting in a compact high power green laser before frequency doubled
solid state lasers were available.

<h2>Wavelengths, Spectra, White Light Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argwse0">Argon Ion and Krypton Ion Laser Wavelengths</A></h3>

While most HeNe lasers output a single wavelength, argon and krypton ion
lasers are often designed and/or set up to output many wavelengths at the same
time.  Not all lines will lase simultaneously in a given laser, some of these
are only available in larger lasers with more current density.  Others will
compete with each other for gain.  Therefore special mirror coatings or an
intracavity prism (etalon) may be required to obtain output on a few of these
lines.  Consult factory for details about which optics set is needed for your
application.  Large output powers at UV and IR will require special tube
processing and/or crystalline quartz Brewster windows to avoid losses,
solarization, and color center formation in the optics. 
<p>
<ul> 
<li>Argon ion visible lines (8 UV lines and 2 IR lines ignored):
<p> 
  454.6 nm, 457.9 nm, 465.8 nm, 472.6 nm, 476.5 nm, 488.0 nm, 496.5 nm,
  501.7 nm, 514.5 nm, 528.7 nm.
<p>
<li>Krypton ion visible lines (4 UV and 8 IR lines ignored) 
<p>
  406.7 nm, 413.1 nm, 415.4 nm, 468.0 nm, 476.2 nm, 482.5 nm, 520.8 nm,
  530.9 nm, 568.2 nm, 647.1 nm, 676.4 nm.
</ul>
<p>
Which lines actually lase are sensitive to both tube current and gas pressure
and thus the color balance (relative intensity of the various wavelengths)
will shift as the tube heats up and with age.
<p>
To get an idea of the actual perceived color at each wavelength, see the
section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioicol">Color Versus Wavelength</A>.

<h3><A NAME="argeolp">Effects of Optics on Laser Performance</A></h3>

Different types of optics may be used on a laser to optimize or select a
particular performance characteristic.  Where one or both mirrors are external,
optics sets can be swapped to change behavior.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argwse8">Substituting Optics Between Lasers</A>.
<p>
<b>Single-line or multiline</b>: This refers to the output spectral lines in
the beam.  For ion lasers, several wavelengths can be generated simultaneously.
The reflectivity curve of the Output Coupler (OC) mirror and tube current
determine which subset of the possible lasing lines are active.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Single-line - One and only one of the possible wavelengths is generated.
 no matter what the tube current (within its specifications).  Example: 488 nm
 argon ion laser.
<p>
<li>multiline - Some subset of the possible wavelengths are generated.  Which
 of these is actually present in the beam will also depend on the tube current.
 As the tube current is increased, high gain lines appear first and the output
 beam power of each line increases with increasing tube current.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>All-line optics are broadband coated to permit all the common wavelengths
  to be generated (e.g., up to 8 lines for argon ion.)  For a mixed gas
  (argon/krypton) ion laser, white light output (some combination of red,
  yellow, green, and blue) may be obtained.
 <p>
 <li>Line suppression optics may eliminate one or more lines selectively.
  (e.g., all lines except 514.5 nm.)
 <p>
 <li>multiline optics may be used in conjunction with a line selecting prism
  (usually at the HR end of the resonator) to generate any of the possible
  wavelengths by turning a knob.
 </ul>
<p>
 Also see the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argwse1">Single-Line and
 Multiline Output</A>.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Single-mode or multimode</b>: This refers to the axial mode structure of
 the output beam.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Single-mode optics produce a TEM00 beam with a Gaussian profile.  This
 is highly desirable for many applications and essential in particular for
 interferometry and holography.  Most helium-neon and argon/krypton ion lasers
 are set up to produce a TEM00 beam.
<p>
<li>Multimode optics results in a beam with more than one 'hot spot'.  For
 example, a TEM11 beam has a four quadrant appearance which will be very
 apparent if the beam is expanded (though it probably can be focused to a
 fairly decent spot).  The individual sub-beams are not mutually coherent
 so it is somewhat like having several separate lasers whose beams have been
 combined side-by-side.  The advantage of multimode optics is that much more
 output power can be obtained for a given size tube and operating current.
 These lasers are suitable for light shows and other applications that just
 want a large number of photons.
</ul>
<p>
The table below shows the distribution of output wavelengths as a function of
the type of optics and tube current for an ALC-60X/Omni-532 compatible argon
ion tube (specific model unknown).

</PRE>

<b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>The total power output for all lines using multiline optics is greater
 than the sum of the single-line outputs at the same tube current.  This is
 probably due to the contribution of the additional wavelengths (the other 5
 of the 8 common argon ion lines) not shown in the table.
<p>
<li>With multiline optics, the relative output power of each wavelength will
 be roughly the same as those indicated for single-line optics.
<p>
<li>With multimode optics, 50 to 100 percent higher power output can be
 obtained for the same tube current (and tube life).
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="argwse1">Single-Line and Multiline Output</A></h3>

Since the argon and krypton lasing mediums have substantial gain at several
spectral lines (see the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argwse0">Argon Ion and
Krypton Ion Laser Wavelengths</A>), a given laser can be set up to output on
a single line or more than one at the same time depending on how the optics
are designed and adjusted.  The tube current also affects this to some extent
as increasing the current will bring in progressively more lower gain lines.
<p>
A laser set up for multiline operation will usually result in highest total
output power but there are many applications where a monochromatic beam is
required.
<p>
multiline operation requires a set of mirrors with reflectivities designed to
achieve laser operation for all the desired spectral lines.  Any intracavity
prisms are removed.
<p>
Single-line operation can be implemented in a couple of different ways:
<ul>
<li>Special optics sets coated to transmit more then 15% of the lines you don't
 want, thus killing them from oscillating.
<p>
<li>An intracavity prism is added between end of the Brewster window and the
 High Reflector (HR, non-output end) mirror.  This consists of a tuning prism
 and a standard (usually) HR optic in a special mount (or a Littrow prism
 which includes the HR coating on its rear surface).  Rotating the vertical
 micrometer adjustment changes the angle of the prism to select wavelengths.
 (There will be dark spaces with no lasing in between wavelengths as you turn
 the screw.)  See the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtsa6">The Intracavity
 Prism</A>
<p>
<li>An intracavity etalon is added intracavity between the tube and one
 of the mirrors (usually the HR).  The peaks of the etalon are tuned by
 temperature and angle to select out (usually) a single lasing line, at
 about 0.5 to 0.6 the output power compared to single line optics.  See the
 next section.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="argefil"> Etalons for Ion Lasers</A></h3>

<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The typical ion laser etalon is 15 mm diameter, 12 mm thick, fused silica
or quartz, coated to reflect about 10% from both sides, usually with as
few coating layers as possible.  It's heated
10 to 20 &deg;C above room temperature, stable within 0.001 &deg;C.
Without temperature control, it won't be very stable.
The laser will flash at 2 to 3 Hz as the etalon temperature
stabilizes.  You peak it on a bright flash.
<p>
Even a thick plate of window glass will get you started,
the trick is to position it correctly and keep it warm.
Trust me, try making  a simple holder using a (Newport) MM1 or MM2 and
stick a piece of high quality glass or quartz intracavity.
<p>
Etalons need to first be adjusted to what is referred to as "Flash".  In
other words, extremely parallel to the cavity where minute changes in
the angle take the cavity in and out of resonance very quickly.  They
are then walked to a offset angle that sets the choice of single
frequency once they heat up.
<p>
I have one of these rugs I maintain running 24/7 locked to an iodine cell
with a etalon,

<h3><A NAME="argwse2">More Comments on Argon/Krypton Spectral Lines</A></h3>

An air-cooled argon ion tube will only lase at: 457.9 nm, 465.8 nm, 472.7 nm,
476.5 nm, 488 nm, 496.5 nm, 501.7 nm, and 514.5 nm.  The 457.9 nm, 488 nm, and
514 nm lines are common as single lines for argon ion air-cooled tubes due to
their strength.  The majority of power will be in those lines but the relative
strengths will also depend on tube current.  See the section:
<A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrtle0">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Tube Life</A> for a
chart which includes argon ion spectral line power versus tube current for
single-line, multiline, and multimode optics for a typical air-cooled tube.
<p>
For krypton, the lines are 647 nm and 530 nm.  Krypton lines are sensitive to
pressure and magnetic field strength.  All water-cooled ion lasers have axial
electromagnets around the bore to concentrate the arc.  A krypton laser will
have a high/low field switch as well.
<p>
The tables below list the relative strengths of all the important lines for a
typical 30 watt argon/7 watt krypton laser with:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Same tube, same power supply, proper fill pressure for maximum power.
<p>
<li>Optics for TEM00 mode Gaussian beam, all lines.  (There would be more power
 with multimode optics.)
<p>
<li>Current adjusted for best performance for that tube and then kept constant.
<p>
<li>Prism selecting each line so it lases by itself.
</ul>
<p>
Normally, optics are selected to support the mission of the laser - i.e.,
surgery wants only the blue lines; ophthalmology needs green, red, and yellow;
Raman Spectroscopy needs 647 and 676 nm; laser shows use argon for blue,
green, and violet, and krypton for red and yellow.  Mixed gas lasers use
optics selected for 55% red, 20% green, and 25% blue and violet.  To kill a
line, one of the optics is made more then 15% transmissive at that line.
<p>
The 488 and 514.5 nm lines are lower then normal on this list - other
manufacturers claim more power for these 2 lines.  Note: The total power
for all wavelengths adds up to more than 30/7 W because these lines are
selected with a prism and are not lasing simultaneously which would result
in wavelength competition.

Depending on gas fill, current, optics, and luck, there may be other weak
lines present including: 437 nm (argon), and 457.7 nm, 461.9 nm, 657.0 nm,
687.0 nm, and 799.3 nm (krypton).
<p>
As a side note, the color saturation with an ion laser is unbelievable, it's
possible to get 16.8 million distinct shades with off the shelf hardware.  I
know the eye can't resolve that but the results you can see are beautiful.

(From: Tom Yu (tlyu@mit.edu).)
<p>
I found the following interesting comments on relative power of the various
argon ion lines in my Spectra-Physics 164/166/167/168 manual.  (These are the
medium-frame 1 meter water-cooled Argon or Krypton lasers that want 3-phase
208 VAC at 40 A per line or so.)
<p>
<blockquote>
"A more interesting effect in the case of argon, specifically, is that
 of relative intensity and gain ratios in the case of the two strong
 lines, 488.0 nm and 514.5 nm.  Most of the visible laser transitions
 in the CW argon-ion laser have approximately the same gain-to-power
 ratio as 488.0 nm, although they are weaker than that line and
 generally have less gain.  The 514.5 nm line, however, has only about
 1/4 the gain of the 488.0 nm line, but has approximately 25% more
 power output when the gain is sufficient to overcome internal losses.
 This effect is largely due to the difference in the atomic constants
 that determine the power-to-gain ratio, owing to the fact that the
 514.5 nm upper state comes from a different family of levels than do
 most of the other transitions."
</blockquote>
<p>
It seems that this explains nicely why the 514.5 nm line is quite weak
at lower powers but quickly becomes as strong as the 488.0 nm line at
higher tube currents.

<h3><A NAME="argwse4">White Light Lasers</A></h3>

The term 'white light laser' typically refers to one that is capable of
producing a set of wavelengths in the red, green, and blue portions of the
spectrum which if mixed in the proper proportion can 'simulate' the effect
of a white light source in full color displays and laser shows, and for some
spectroscopy or other applications.  There may also be colors like yellow
produced in addition or in place of others.  However, white light lasers
generally don't produce a broad spectrum like an incandescent light bulb
(though there are apparently some exceptions, at least in the research lab).
The individual wavelengths are coherent but not with each-other.  The beam
characteristics (i.e., diameter, divergence, polarization, etc.) of each
wavelength are similar to what would be expected if that were the only one
wavelength present.  There are no optical interactions between colors (light
waves that are not the same wavelength/frequency do not interact with
each other in a linear medium) but there may be affects in terms of one
lasing transition stealing power from another.  For many purposes, the
white light laser is equivalent to several individual single color lasers
combined into one beam, but in a smaller package at lower cost.
<p>
The most common white light lasers are large frame ion types with a mixture
of argon and krypton for the gas fill.
<p>
White light lasers are now even available in air cooled format. All use a mix
of argon and krypton. Many are made for a roughly 60:20:20 ratio of red,
green, and blue lines for proper white balance.  Their reliability is
increasing with cost staying a little above normal Ion laser prices.
Spectra-Physics, Coherent and Lexel all manufacture tubes for this.  And
LaserPhysics, Inc. sells the air-cooled version that runs off single phase
220 VAC and does 400+ milliwatts.  Most of these lasers are modified for
reduced operator skills with sealed mirrors and simplified power supplies.
So, yes, they are out there, and laser company reps tell me the demand is
going up as people start to use them for lab and industrial applications as
well as display.
<p>
There are other ion lasers that aren't optimized for best laser show or TV
color rendition but for other applications.  For example, some biological
mixed gas and biological krypton will kill green, lase red, yellow, and blue,
With RYB optics, there will never be more than say 4 lines and no
green, not 514 nm, not 520 nm, nor 530 nm.  The RYB optic will have a 15%
or greater transmission from 500 to around 550 nm.  The lasing transmissions
are about 1.5% for blue, 0.8% for yellow, and 1.2% for red.
If it has RYGB optics, there will be about 7 lines.  Note that for the
laser enthusiast, these have a high novelty value but are less than ideal
for for display due to their wavelengths as noted above.  With external
mirror lasers, the optics sets can be replaced but this may not be ideal
if the gas fill ratio and pressure isn't optimal.
<p>
CREOL in Florida and quite a few other labs have demonstrated RGB as well in
diode pumped frequency doubled YAG lasers so smaller and more practical is just
around the corner as soon as ways are found around the materials and quality
control problems with solid state laser components.  Right now they have to
test 4 or 5 crystals for every good one they get.
<p>
Note that other technologies can be used for white light lasers.  For example:
<p>
(From: Colin Evans (c.j.evans@goose.ac.uk).)
<p>
A white light laser was developed in this department several years ago. It was
based on a helium-cadmium mixture which could lase simultaneously at red,
green and blue wavelengths.  There was no automatic balance between the three
colours and had to be carefully adjusted using the pressure and temperature.
Also, I don't know whether the three colours could be regarded as "coherent"
in any sense. Advantages are very strict polarization, and narrow parallel
beams, neither of which are much use in a projector.
<p>
(From: Marco Lauschmann (mq-laser@gmx.de).
<p>
The only real white laser I know of used a Bucky-ball (carbon) compound which
was optical pumped by the 488 nm line of a argon ion Laser.  The emission was
a real white light continuum - not like the 488 nm, 514, nm and 647 nm lines
of an Ar/Kr ion laser system which looks like white light to the human eye.
Researchers at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology have demonstrated that confined buckyballs emit strong white light
when excited by blue light from an argon-ion laser.  Although work is at an
early stage, the group has already identified some possible applications for
this new material. They suggest that it may form the basis of a new laser
material or new types of optical displays.
<p>
Another source for a white light continuum is a Ti:Sapphire regenerative
amplifier with a frequency doubler.  So, a white light continuum could be
produced with 800 nm output of 150 Fs, 500 uJ pulses at 1 kHz from a
Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier, which extends from 400 to 1500 nm. A 5 cm
long piece of fused silica is the non-linear element and was used to generate
the continuum.  This is only an example - there are systems which deliver a
white light spectrum with average power of more than 1 W with repetition rates
of 250 kHz or more.

<h3><A NAME="argwltp">Effect of Tube Pressure on White Light Ar/Kr Ion Laser
 Spectral Balance</A></h3>

Here are four photos courtesy of John S. Rubacha that illustrate the laser
lines from the LP 300WC Ar/Kr Laser as a function of tube pressure.
<p>
<ol>
<li><A HREF="wllines1.jpg">White Light Ar/Kr Ion Laser Spectral Lines</A> shows
 the laser output as seen with a reflection diffraction grating.  Note the
 zero-order line has a degree of pink shade in its color due to lots of Kr red
 power.
<p>
<li><A HREF="wllines2.jpg">White Light Ar/Kr Ion Laser Diffracted Spots at High
 and Low Tube Pressure</A> shows the distribution of spots and approximate
 intensities as seen with the grating.  At lower pressure, note the appearance
 of the deeper blue Ar lines, the brighter 520 nm Kr green line, the much
 brighter 568 nm Kr yellow line, and the weak appearance of a Kr 687 nm red
 line.
<p>
<li><A HREF="wllines3.jpg">White Light Ar/Kr Ion Laser Spectral Balance at High
 and Low Tube Pressure</A> shows RGB and white at the same tube pressures as in
 the previous photo.  The overall white color balance is definitely shifted
 towards pink/red at high tube pressure, it is near normal at low tube
 pressure.
</ol>
<p>
A word of caution.  The digital camera does not record with the same range
of brightness the eye can perceive visually.  Thus the intensities of the
laser lines are somewhat "compressed".
<p>
Please note that the 530 nm Kr green line is suppressed on YBR Krypton
and White Light lasers as it suppresses gain on the 568 nm yellow line.
That's why the normally very strong green line at 530 nm is also missing in
the spectrum and pictures.  Killing the 530 nm line also kills the 528 nm
line in argon because the coating is not that selective.  This is in addition
to the red/yellow pressure branch problem. This laser was shipped initially
very high in pressure - these pictures are the result of what happens when
the excess gas is "burned off" after many hundreds of hours of operation. What
is missing is the picture of the initial state of this laser, which had just
the 488 and 482 nm lines lasing with the red lines, which results in a
sort of strange magenta color.

<h3><A NAME="argwse5">Ion Laser Dielectric Mirrors</A></h3>

(Also see the sections: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioimir">Mirrors used for Lasers
and Laser Applications</A> and <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioiedm">Estimating
Dielectric Mirror Spectral Reflectivity</A>.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Argon ion lasers are generally shipped with broadband optics installed, they
are usually a 100 to 200 layer dielectric stack.  The high reflectors are
coated for 99.999% reflection at all wavelengths (that the laser may be set up
produce - they will still be transparent at others). The OC is what is changed.
Wavelength selective output couplers are coated for a minimum 15 to 20%
transmission on lines that are *not* supposed to lase, and the transmission
for desired lines varies from .5 to to 12 %, depending on the length of the
laser.  Higher power tubes have more gain and thus use a higher transmission.
An air-cooled laser will have transmission in the .5 to 1.5% range, short-frame
water-cooled lasers will be in the 2 to 5% range and 25 watt large-frame types
will be in the 8 to 12% range.  It is possible to adjust the coatings for a
given color balance if you have a large number of identical tubes. Ion optics
are sold as matched pairs, and loosing half a pair can ensure that you will
play musical mirrors and maybe not even lase.  However some manufacturers have
different OCs you can use with a given HR.
<p>
In the case of lasers with a intracavity prism, unless the client pays extra
for special optics for a weak line that doesn't have that much gain, a
broadband set is still used. 
<p> 
White Light lasers using Ar/Kr mixes are using a mirror coated for 400 to 700
nm broadband high reflectance and an OC that usually kills the 531 nm line
of krypton, as these compete with the yellow line for gain, thus killing
the yellow if they are allowed to lase.  The 647 nm red and 568 nm yellow lines
share the same upper state and thus the optics must be tailored for a given
red/yellow balance on a given laser tube design at a given gas pressure, thus
making these optics even more expensive. 
<p>
A typical 1/2" diameter large-frame optic is $400 to 500 from the factory PER
optic.  White Light optics are about $2,000 a set minimum.

<h3><A NAME="argbrew">Comments on Brewster Window Seals</A></h3>

Although it may appear that these are glued in place, the Epoxy/TorrSeal
is only a backup.  Modern tubes usually have their Brewster
windows optically contacted whereby
the two pieces are superpolished flat and are so clean that
they stick together vacuum tight on contact.  This weak covalent
bonding is then put into a hot oven in an electrostatic field to
increase ion mobility and make a more permanent bond, but it is still
subject to shear (sideways stress) failure - i.e., you flick it with a
finger or tool and it might dislodge, often taking some part of the
stem with it. The epoxy prevents the shear stress problem and does
provide some small leak prevention.
<p>
Still it's a selected silica filled epoxy with a high Tg. low cost 5
minute epoxy from the drug store or department store wont do it.
<p>
If you dare, take a very sharp razor blade and very slowly press its
sharp edge in against a unglued older brewster where it joins to the
stem and POP! Off comes the now ruined window and a flat undamaged
polished face is usually left on the stem.  If you stick that window
between polarizers in a stress analyzer, it is now very deformed.

<h3><A NAME="argwse7">Comparison of Power with Single-Line Versus Multiline
 Optics</A></h3>

The basic question is: Will replacing a multiline OC with one for a particular
wavelength result in more power on that particular line because the others
are suppressed or will it be pretty much the same?  (HRs are often broadband
regardless of the particular OC fitted to the laser).
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).) 
<p>
This depends on the line and size of the tube.  In a long bore laser, there may
be a 10 to 15% gain on some lines while on other lines there will be little or
no net gain.  Some lines share a given upper state and tube conditions such as
pressure and magnetic field determine where they fall.  For example, the red
and yellow lines of krypton will fight each other.  If I recall my
Spectra-Physics manual correctly, there are two weak argon lines that can
also fight, but I can't remember which ones and it's an insignificant
difference in normal operation anyhow.
<p>
For a short tube argon, there may be few percent increase in power with single
line optics.  They are used for spectral purity in a short tube ion laser.
For example, each line comes to focus at a slightly different point on the
film or drum in a printer or copier which means you would have to filter out
one of the lines or use expensive achromatic optics.  Or, a particular line
is used for spectroscopy and the other one would increase the noise level if
not removed.
<p>
Narrow band dielectric mirrors are easier to manufacture anyhow so they should
be cheaper as well - a win-win situation for many applications.

<h3><A NAME="argwse8">Substituting Optics Between Lasers</A></h3>

For lasers with external mirrors, it may be possible to swap optics to change
the lasing wavelengths or switch from single-line to multiline, for example,
for an ion laser.  However, just because a mirror can be made to fit, doesn't
mean it will work well or at all.  For example, the optics of the ILT-5490 and
ALC-60X are the same physical size but will result in less than optimal
performance if swapped (for one thing, the radii of curvature are different -
45 versus 60 cm, respectively).
<p>
There are several parameters which must be closely matched to achieve enough
resonator gain and make alignment something that doesn't share too many
characteristics with Chinese Water Torture. :)
<p>
The best option if you really want to do this (realizing that a partial mirror
alignment will almost certainly be needed in any case), is to acquire a
replacement OC or complete mirror sets designed for your particular model
laser.  Some companies sell what they claim are 'high output optics' at
similarly high prices for this purpose.  Unfortunately, I don't know of any
reliable way of determining whether a given product will do anything for you
or your laser other than waste an afternoon or more in installation and
alignment.  Specifications are rarely detailed enough to make a decision on
technical merit.  So, if you are willing to spend the time, at least get a
binding money back warranty.
<p>
However, where you have something sitting on the shelf or a potentially good
deal arises, here are some considerations:
<ul>
<li>Wavelengths - Spectral characteristics of the two mirrors must be
 compatible with what you hope to achieve:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>The High Reflector (HR) must be essentially 100 percent reflecting at the
  wavelengths of interest.  Argon ion laser HRs are usually coated to be
  broadband for their possible green/blue/violet lines even if the OC
  originally installed in the laser was single-line.
 <p>
 <li>The OC must be coated to have the proper transmission (100 minus the
  percent reflectivity) at the wavelengths of interest.  You can't put an OC
  from a 4 W large-frame ion laser into an ALC-60X and expect it to work at
  all - the transmission will be is way to high (perhaps 5% versus 1%).
  Conversely, putting a small air-cooled argon optic into a large-frame will
  result in a mismatch and I suspect, even possible damage due to the
  excessively large light flux inside the resonator.  All other factors being
  equal, there will be a reflectivity for each line which maximizes power
  output at that wavelength.
 <p>
  For example, here is a table of OC traansmission percent (100 minus
  reflectivity) for some typical argon ion lasers:
 <PRE>
          Output Power   OC Transmission   Circulating Power
         ----------------------------------------------------
               .1 W            1 %               10.0 W
               .5 W            2 %               25.0 W
              1.5 W            3 %               45.5 W
              4.0 W            5 %               80.0 W
             10.0 W            8 %              125.0 W
             20.0 W           11 %              182.0 W

 </PRE>
 The "Circulating Power" is the light flux inside the cavity.  While not
 really useful (it can't be tapped off for anything practical), these high
 values do demonstrate that there is serious activity going on in there (and
 the Brewster windows must be able to handle it)!
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Curvature - One or both optics are usually ground to be slightly concave.
 The focal length (f = 1/2 the radius of curvature) for each laser is selected
 based on resonator length and is typically between just slightly longer than
 the distance between mirrors and twice this value (but it might be much
 longer).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If either radius is too long, alignment will be a real hair-puller
  approaching that of having two plane mirrors - not something you want
  to attempt for a laser of any size.  Stability will also suffer even if you
  can get it aligned in the first place.  However, this will result in
  maximum power output.
 <p>
 <li>If either radius is too short, alignment will also be much more difficult
  or impossible.  Even if you get it to lase, maximum power may be greatly
  reduced from what is expected since less of the lasing medium participates
  in stimulated emission due to the beam shape inside the resonator.
 </ul>

<h3><A NAME="argwolf">Which Optics to Use on a Large-Frame Ion Laser</A></h3>

The following addresses questions along the lines of the following:
<p>
<blockquote>
 "I have a XYZ corporation small or medium-frame ion laser.  It's old, but it
  seems to have gas.  I didn't get optics with it. I don't even know if it's
  argon or krypton.  Heck, it may be mixed gas. What optics should I buy?" 
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Recent experience suggests that just about any 1 meter class ion laser
will lase with the following mirror specs, at moderate power with no major
sensitivity to alignment.  You may or may not get peak possible power, but
IT WILL lase, over a wide range of pressures, gas mixes, and magnetic fields.
Mode quality is not guaranteed, and we observed everything from TEM00 to
doughnut mode to high order multimode.  However none of the odd modes such as
1,2 or 2,2 or 3 to 5 were seen and in each case, a round beam was obtained.
When doughnut mode was lasing, the band to hole ratio was at least 20 to 1,
i.e., a very small hole.
<p>
These combinations has been tested on a Lexel 88, Lexel 95, American Laser 68,
HGM 5, HGM 20, Spectra-Physics 164/168, and Omni 543.  In krypton, argon, and
mixed gas.  In every case, it lased well but not always on every line. 
<p>
The HR had a 2 meter radius with 100% reflectivity at desired
wavelengths.
<p>
The OC had a 2 meter radius with transmission as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>670 nm red, 0.6%.
<li>647 nm red, 1.1 %.
<li>568 nm yellow (kill 647 nm/pressure sensitive, favors lower
 currents/pressures).
<li>574 nm yellow (kill 530 nm green to get this Kr line).
<li>514 nm Green, 0.92%.
<li>520 nm Green, 0.72%.
<li>530 nm Green, 0.73%.
<li>482/488/496 nm blue, 0.9%.
<li>477 Violet, 0.35%.
</ul>
<p>
There is a second yellow line in Kr. It is never spec'd in manufacturers'
data because it is hard to obtain without a prism and special optics.
There is also no major demand for it, and its gain is much lower then the
568 nm yellow. But we had it lasing day before yesterday. One tube rebuilder
specs his White Light optics for this line and kills 568 nm to obtain a stable
yellow for planetarium displays.
<p>
530 nm green was killed at the HR during some tests by use of a standard
argon or KR OC. In one case, a standard argon HR produced lasing on 2 blues
and two yellows in pure krypton. In no case was the 528 nm argon line observed
as far as we know, it seems to require a low transmission.  (But see the
section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#arg528n">How to Get 528 nm in an Argon Ion
Laser</A>.)  Lasers tested were a mix of Kr only, Ar only and MG lasers. The
optic used for the OC was 7.62 mm in diameter. This optic was good for some
lasers, but resulted in extra high intracavity powers for others. In some
cases performance was better then factory optics. A few larger lasers were
tested with a 1 meter mirror at each end and this worked well, but 1 meter
mirrors were not recommended for the ALC-68/LExel-88/Omni-543 sized lasers
as power was weak due to lack of mode volume.  
<p>
Argon optics pairs produced poor low power lasing on pure krypton as their
transmission was too high, i.e., the Lexel-95 standard argon optics were
very poor and resulted in only a faint blue from the same sized krypton.
<p>

lasers. Thanks to Karl at Promethius Photonics for providing the high grade
chemicals used in this study.

<h3><A NAME="arg528n">How to Get 528 nm in an Argon Ion Laser</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I wanted 528 nm from an argon ion laser. I'd only seen it once in a huge
Laser Ionics tube at very high pressure.  Strangely, that tube had a more
or less orange glow at the cathode sheath, much more orange then normal.
Now I know why.  After a year of research and wondering if my prism was
walking out of alignment when cranked to the 528 nm position, I found the
solution in a old gas laser text the library was throwing out. It turns out
you need a trace of neon in the tube to get the right upper state. No wonder
528 is always labeled "special testing required" from the manufacturer.

<h2>Ion Laser Power Output and Efficiency</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argiak2">Expected Output Power from Surplus or Previously Owned
 Ion Lasers</A></h3>

So you saw an advertisement for a 100 mW Cyonics-2201 or 300 mW ALC-60X.
Should these be believed?  Probably not, at least not if they are pulls from
graphic arts equipment or some other similar source.  There may be versions of
these lasers that will do higher output power (possibly with identical model
numbers or ones that are close) but they usually don't show up at bargain
prices - e.g., the ALC-60A, a current model, will do over 100 mW on all lines,
but this isn't the same laser as the ALC-60X!).  Lasers from reputable dealers
will have their *minimum* guaranteed output power clearly listed and may
actually produce much more when new.  That Cyonics *may* do only 10 mW and
that ALC *may* do only 20 mW - or even less.
<p>
About that 300 mW claim, all I can say is: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha....
<p>
150 mW yes, 175 yes, 225 to 250, yes on a factory select tube.  300, hum...
Rarely and not for long unless it was designed that way. Note where the PSU
current limit is set when they claim this.  Note that newer high-tech tubes
can do this running on 115 VAC.  One manufacturer does make a 300 mW sealed
mirror retrofit for the 60X.  Laser Physics'  Reliant series certainly does. 
<p>
What happened is when large quantities of these units were in use, a few
companies made money rebuilding them in quantity. They bought large
quantities of pulls for rebuilding.  They didn't care which tube they
installed in a unit, as long as it met spec and lasted out the warranty. So
therefore once in a while you can hit the jackpot on a used laser and get a
hot tube.  Once in a while you can also pick up a head that was designed
for high power. 
<p>
It's with special multimode optics and a high divergence doughnut mode or
worse beam shape on a selected tube. Notice how vendors have power graded
pricing, this lines up with the factory catalog of tubes. Note that lasers
almost always are shipped doing well above the factory rating when new.  Yes
this gets you 275 mW or so on a fresh new high power tube at 10 A with
brand new optics and a sweet new cathode.  To sustain it for any length of
time it takes 11 A.   But I'd want a iron clad warranty I could enforce.
<p>
The idea is buy a hot laser and run it lower then its rated power, and
thus enjoy longer life.  Thats why you could retune that tube to 110 mW or so,
it was derated for longer service and the optics were tuned to run at a
fairly constant power over its life. Run it at 60 to 70 mW and enjoy it for a
long time. 
<p>
And, as with any laser, the CDRH safety sticker or catalog listing may not be
an accurate indication of useful or possible output power.  Actual performance
may be a small fraction of what you expected!  This is a significant issue
with ion lasers since they have many variables affecting output power (compared
to internal mirror HeNe lasers, for example, where the output power is pretty
much fixed - it isn't affected in a significant way by tube current or often
not even much by age and use).  The output power of an ion laser is a strong
function of tube current and life expectancy is inversely proportional to tube
current!  So, the rating on the CDRH safety sticker is likely to be much much
higher than what could be used with expectations of a reasonable tube life.
And, unscrupulous or unknowledgeable people can list the power based on a
ridiculously high tube current where life might only be a few hours!  Ion
tubes that are physically the same size and interchangeable in a laser chassis
also can vary by a large factor in power ratings even if they are new
depending on manufacturer and model.  For tubes with external mirrors, the
type of resonator (single-line fixed, single-line with line selecting prism,
multiline) as well as alignment and cleanliness, strongly influence output
power.  At least you can remedy problems with some of these with some basic
maintenance or parts replacement.  However, age, total operating hours, and
possible prior abuse, are also significant factors affecting ion laser
performance and there is little you can do to revive a weak tube.

Most of these lasers came from xerox machines which were set up for single
line 488 nm TEM00 running at about 6 to 7 amps when installed.  New they would
do about 15 to 20 mW in that configuration.  There were also slightly different
tubes (bore diameter) which would preclude higher current densities as the
cross sectional area of the active region was smaller. You can and many do
install broadband mirrors which would more than double the output.  And, you
can increase the current as much as 100% (double) as installed, which would
give you the higher power limits advertized (and, of course, much shorter tube
life).  Additionally if the optics were not carefully aligned it was real easy
to catch the rubber between the photocell and the front tilt plate when beam
walking the laser which would smoke the rubber onto the front optic and beam
splitter.
<p>
A used laser is just that - and priced accordingly unless the tube meets
specifications as originally installed.  And some units due to the smaller
bore diameter will never attain the higher power levels.
<p>
(From: Mike Kenney (MKenny1989@aol.com).)
<p>
Nearly all of the 60Xs made for Xerox came with 200 cm, 488 to 505 nm TEM00
optics - very flat and wern't coated for all of the argon wavelengths. That's
why if you had a new tube from American Laser with Xerox optics you might get
85 mW at 10 amps.  However, with 60 cm, 450 to 530 nm multimode optics, you
can get 250 mW at 10 amp.  I just sold one with a new tube (not regassed or
refurbished) that was putting out 200 mW at 9 amps.  The true capability of
these lasers is only really understood by American, Omnichrome, and National
laser service and that's about it.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I'd tend to agree, although the hottest 60X I've ever seen on a laser power
meter was 225 mW.  However when you figure out the uncertainty in the power
meter calibration, that tends to jive. Xerox needed a small focal point and
the AO used on the sled would tend to diffract out the 514 and 477 nm lines a
lot, so the narrow band was needed to get a tight spot. Xerox Sled AOs are
carefully AR coated and have a wedge on the backside of the crystal that
probably corrects for the diffraction.
<p>
My source for used optics was a rebuilder who had  Xerox contracts, he
bought heads where ever he could get them, and stashed all the old optics
in 55 gallon drums. He gave me a couple of hand fulls of optics from each
drum and put them in optics shipping boxes from Coherent Auburn division.
I'd get a laser off a used xerox sled and reoptic it using something from
the barrel batch, or some bought from a laser engineer living in SLC.,
usually just the OC, and WHAM! 110 to 150 mW and all lines on many of the
units. It would take some matching of the optics to get the best power.
Tubes with better heatsinks also  did better, so I suspect heat transfer
plays a part. 
<p>
I also agree that the factory can dial in the lifetime and power to anywhere
they want it. There also were other tubes that I knew were brand new but I
could never coax more then 20 mW out of them as well. 
<p>
The middle of the road optics that I prefer all had 120 cm radius, its a
nice tradeoff between beam diameter and divergence compared to the 60-60s,
and some customers would gladly sacrifice some power for a tight beam. The
hottest 60X  I ever saw  was a dual side fan 60C that had a TEM01 structure
and all lines and was from a HELL Typesetter, it would easy burn holes in
the wall.  I didn't have a PM with me, but that laser would give my Lexel 88
a run for the money. 
<p>
The really good high power "X" OCs have a deep cherry red color when
viewed in transmission, as opposed to the straw or yellow color of the
tailored copier optics.  But you can't just go by the color, for example
I've seen I've seen optics from Auburn that have a radial gradient, or
"bullseye" pattern that performed just as well as the cherries and were
almost transparent. Usually just the OC is doctored, its kind of expensive to
change anything but the radius on both optics, and that coating is really
dialed in. We have a excellent UV/VIS spectrometer here at work and I can
barely make out the changes in transmission from a known high power all
lines optic except they bleed out much more 514/528 nm green and have
reflectivity almost to the UV. The difference is a fraction of a percent in
transmission. I can also easily see the 10% or more changes in transmission
on a line that is killed. 
<p>
However the thing I always wanted to read was the document that spec'd the
OC transmissions versus wavelengths for all the different factory  shipping
powers, it would be very interesting. I did once find the curves for the
RYB krypton lasers developed for confocal microscopy, and the changes
needed for a given power were very minute.   

<h3><A NAME="argdpol">Determining the Power Output of an Ion Laser</A></h3>

So, you obtained a surplus argon ion laser from one of those printer things
and would like to have an idea of whether it is performing anywhere close to
what was claimed by the seller.  Or, you are just curious.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to do this is with a properly calibrated laser power meter.
<li>The second best way to do this is with a properly calibrated laser power
meter.<br>
<li>The third best way to do this is with a properly calibrated laser power
 meter.
<li>The nth best way to do this is with a properly calibrated laser power
 meter. :-)
</ul>
<p>
However, it should be possible to estimate the power output of a small ion
laser using a simple laser power meter such as the one described in the
sections: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm3">Sam's Super Cheap and Dirty Laser
Power Meter</A>	or <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm3a">Simple Laser Power Meter
Using Photocell</A>.  In fact, about all you really need is almost any type
of photodiode (those from old computer mice floppy drives are fine), a
working 9 V battery (even if it is tired and puts out only 7 V), a multimeter
that measures DC mA, and a 1K ohm resistor (to protect your multimeter should
the photodiode be connected backwards or decide to turn into a blob of
solder). :)
<p>
The approach below makes use of the relative brightness sensitivity of the
human eye to provide a reference in comparison to a HeNe laser at 632.8 nm
with a known power output.  The simple laser power meter can then be used as a
relative indicator of ion laser's output at various tube currents.  To perform
the comparison, the ion laser must have adjustable output (from just above
threshold) and the <b>actual</b> power output of the HeNe laser must be
known - not just the typically much higher value printed on the CDRH safety
sticker.
<p>
This same basic approach (with minor modifications) can be used for other
types of lasers with variable power output or through the use of a variable
laser attenuator or set of neutral density filters.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the ion laser and HeNe laser side-by-side with their beams an inch
 or so apart shining on a white diffuse surface.  This probably works better
 if the beam diameter is large enough so that the brightness of the HeNe laser
 isn't overpowering - maybe an inch or so.
<p>
<li>Adjust the output of the ion laser so that it <b>appears</b> to be the
 same brightness as the HeNe laser.  Take your time - this will ultimately
 determine the accuracy of the result.
<p>
<li>Use the chart in the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioicav2">Relative
 Visibility of Light at Various Wavelengths</A> to compute the approximate
 actual power output of the ion laser.
<p>
 For a single-line ion laser, use that wavelength.  For argon or krypton ion
 lasers with multiline (all lines) optics, use 488 nm and 647.1 nm
 respectively, since those wavelengths will be dominant at low power.  Multiply
 the (actual) HeNe power, P(HeNe), by the ratio of the eye's relative
 sensitivities at 632.8 nm and 488 nm.
<p>
  So, for a single-line 488 nm or multiline argon ion laser, the output power,
  P(488)<sub>0</sub>, will be:
<PRE>
                                      .171
             P<sub>0</sub> = P(488)<sub>0</sub> = P(HeNe) * ----- = P(HeNe) * .895
                                      .191
</PRE>
<p>
<li>Without changing the setting on the ion laser, put your laser power meter
 kludge (LPMK) in the beam path.  It may be desirable to remove any beam
 spreading optics for greater sensitivity if the spot size is larger than
 the sensor area but this is not critical if you already have enough photons
 for a strong reading.
<p>
<li>Note the reading on LPMK.  This is your reference value, I<sub>0</sub>.
<p>
<li>Increase the ion laser output to whatever maximum you desire and/or set
 it at several outputs and note the reading(s) on your LPMK as well as the
 tube current or current/light control setting.
<p>
<li>The ratio of the LPMK reading to I<sub>0</sub> is the relative output
 compared to the reference level.  Multiply by P<sub>0</sub> to get the actual
 power at each setting.  A photodiode or solar cell based power meter is quite
 linear with intensity.  Though there will be a slight shift in the wavelength
 distribution of output spectral lines as the ion tube current is increased -
 and sensor's response depends on wavelength - this shouldn't affect the
 accuracy very much.
</ol>
<p>
It may be possible to do this without any instruments by comparing the power
determined by comparison with the HeNe laser to values in the chart shown in
the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrtle0">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Tube
Life</A>.  However, depending on your actual current threshold, it is possible
for the relative power versus current relationship to be quite different for
your tube and optics.

<h3><A NAME="argwse3">Efficiency of Argon Ion Lasers</A></h3>

(Portions from: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The output couplers on argon lasers are 5 to 7% transmissive, (much greater
than the helium-neon output side mirror).  (Note: These values are on the high
side for short tubes at least compared to the table out of the service manual
for a commercial argon ion laser in the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argwse8">Substituting Optics Between Lasers</A>.
--- Sam)   So an argon has more gain and it scales as a semi-log function
of current density.  The upper limit is the tube material melting - about 100
watts output at present in experimental (very large) tubes.  (A HeNe tube
peaks in output power and then declines as current is increased.)
<p>
However, for a typical small air-cooled argon ion laser, 100 mW beam power out
for 1,000 W electrical power in is only about .01 percent efficient which is
not quite as 'efficient' as a HeNe laser (e.g., 6 mA at 2,450 V for a typical
10 mW HeNe laser - about .07 percent).
<p>
For a mid-size water-cooled argon ion laser - say 4 W out 7,000 W in,
the efficiency is somewhat better - about .057 percent. :)
<p>
Some specific numbers for maximum output using multiline optics from a few
common argon ion lasers:
<PRE>
                           -------- Tube Input -------   Output
           Laser Model     Current   Voltage   Wattage   Wattage  Efficiency
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Cyonics-2301-20ML     7 A      100 V     .7 kW      .02 W   .0029 %
       Omni-532             10 A      105 V    1.05 kW     .13 W   .0124 %
       Lexel-88             20 A      165 V    3.3 kW     1.5 W    .0454 %
       Coherent-CR18SG      50 A      550 V   27.5 kW    18.0 W    .0654 %
</PRE>

Power outputs (and efficiency) for krypton ion lasers is must lower - perhaps
1/10th to 1/5th of the numbers listed above at the same power input.
<p>
So, from this very comprehensive listing, the larger the laser, the more
efficient it is likely to be when operated at full power.  Note that this
doesn't take into consideration the losses in the power supply - figure
another 10 to 30 percent reduction in efficiency for that!

<h3><A NAME="argbcs6">On the Abysmal Efficiency of Ion Lasers</A></h3>

Now, in the miscellaneous trivia department, here is something to ponder at
night if you are unable to sleep (this is a guaranteed cure for insomnia):
<ul>
<li>At the normal pressure of a ALC-60X type ion tube (a few Torr), there are
 about 1*10<sup>16</sup> argon atoms in the bore at any given time.  (There
 are many times this number in the other parts of the tube but as they
 circulate, the net number of atoms in the bore doesn't change much.)
<p>
<li>When the tube is operating at a current of 10 A, these unfortunately atoms
 are bombarded by about 6*10<sup>19</sup> electrons per second originating at
 the cathode and speeding down the length of the bore to the anode.  In fact,
 since the voltage across the tube is about 100 V but the argon energy levels
 only differ by a couple of electron volts (EV), in principle, each electron
 should be able to excite about 50 argon atoms during it travels.
<p>
<li>1 mW of optical output power represents a flux of about 2.5x10<sup>15</sup>
 photons per second at 514 nm.
</ul>
So, for a tube producing 100 mW of laser light (2.5*10<sup>17</sup> photons
per second), each argon atom must be getting ionized and participating in
stimulated emission only about 25 times a second (though, due to gas
circulation, they aren't likely to be the *same* atoms!).  And, on average, it
takes 240 electrons to produce one photon of useful light!  I might be off by
a factor of 10 here or there.  Now, think of how much power we could get out
of one of these things if it were possible to increase the number of lucky
argon atoms involved in the lasing process and they were kept busy
continuously! :)

<h2>A Typical Small Air-Cooled Argon Ion Laser - the ALC-60X/Omni-532</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argtsa0">Description of a Typical Air-Cooled Argon Ion
 Laser</A></h3>

Unlike HeNe lasers, there are not that many models of argon ion lasers out
there and even fewer available to the hobbyist-scrounger type.  Therefore,
the description below, while generally applicable to most low to medium power
argon ion lasers, is written from the point of view of the American Laser
Corporation Model 60X which was second sourced by Omnichrome, Inc. as the
Model 532.
<p>
The Omni-532 is for all practical purposes a exact drop-in replacement for a
ALC-60X.  Or, that could be reworded that an ALC-60X is a exact drop-in
replacement for an Omni-532.  Both lasers were made to the Xerox "X" open
standard.  While there are minor differences in the electronics, there are
major differences in the construction.  For example, Omni-532 heads have a
cast aluminum alloy L shaped resonator while ALC-60Xs have the traditional
rod and end-plate resonators floating on a baseplate.)  There are also
proprietary differences in the ion tube construction, but their I-V curves
are very interchangeable.
<p>
Other air-cooled argon/krypton ion lasers are similar but not identical.  Keep
this in mind where specific component values or designs are described -
variations are likely where a different laser is concerned.
<p>
An air-cooled tube is a neat little thing about four times the diameter of
an average glass HeNe tube. Most have external mirrors and Brewster windows,
but many are of the sealed mirror variety. What they all have in common is a
heated cathode (like a vacuum tube such as a magnetron) requiring 3.2 volts at
10 to 25 amps.  They operate from a range of 4 to 10 AMPs through the arc
(Yes, that is AMPs) at around 100 VDC.  The tube current is fed to the cathode
via a center tap on the filament winding of the transformer to balance the arc
on the center of the cathode to avoid plasma etching of the cathode supports.
Hence the need for a beefy transformer with #14 or #10 wire on the secondary.
Rewound microwave oven transformers work well for this purpose. 
<p>
The tube is designed for a 100 to 105 V voltage drop, and is ran directly off
the rectified and filtered AC line.  This makes regulating the tube current a
very interesting problem in design because we also have a series injection
igniter (similar in function to a HeNe starter) which is a 3" toroid with 80
turns on the secondary and one turn on the primary. A 10 uF cap is charged to
110 or 400 V depending one the model of laser and is dumped directly into the
1 turn primary through an SCR which has a reverse connected fast switching
(10 ns) diode across it.  You end up with a 500 Khz 30 kV ringing wave pulse
applied to the tube, which can blow the arc out as well as ignite it. The
winding on the igniter transformer is also #14 wire as it also carries the
entire tube current. There is no ballast resistor (as would be found in a HeNe
laser power supply) as it would have to dissipate up to 1,000 watts at times.
There is a .2 ohm resistor in the anode lead inside the head to sense the
current for feedback to the supply, and a beam-splitter sampler that drives a
solar cell for the fine loop, which keeps the light level constant to .05% and
is used to cancel out noise and oscillations in the beam. 
<p>
An air cooled tube's current may be regulated in a variety of ways including
a series pass-bank of 4 high power NPN power transistors in linear mode, with
two 700 V, 20 A PNP transistors ahead of them in switch mode; two 400 V, 25
amp FETs are used in a buck mode converter at 80 Khz; or just a linear
regulator.  Larger water cooled lasers which run off three-phase and need 20
to 35 amps of tube current use about 100 large NPNs in series/parallel strings
for fine adjust and SCR's on the incoming phases for course adjustment.
<p>
The fun part starts when you buy the laser, the power supplies are scarce
and run about $900 to $1,250 used.  When the laser tubes are pulled for a
rebuild every 5,000 hours the PSU stays in the photocopier/printer/medical
instrument/typesetter or whatever until the whole unit is discarded. So the
laser heads show up, but supplies keep their initial value. 
<p>
A tube is good for 2 to 3 rebuilds, and after 5,000 hours they usually have
1,000 to 2,000 or more hours left for they hobbyist to enjoy. Most of the
lasers are built as 150 milliwatt units and ran at 20 milliwatts to enhance
lifetime, so even an old laser still has a lot of potential. 
<p>
There is no book on how to maintain these things either and since it is the
Holy Grail of laser hobbyists to own one, maybe it's time they learned how to
maintain them, clean the optics, align the mirrors, peak the performance and
find out how to avoid paying $3,800 for a used one when you can get one for
less then $1.000.  I (Steve Roberts) paid $125 for my head, and built my own
power supply.

 If your laser has had its tube replaced at some point (which is very likely),
 its appearance may differ considerably from the photo (different style

 there for you to keep track of performance and for tuning the cavity (for
 best results use a analog meter while tuning).

<h3><A NAME="argtsa2">Physical Description of ALC-60X Laser Head</A></h3>

Refer to photos in the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtsa1">Photos of the
Major Components of the ALC Model 60X Laser Head</A> while reading this
description.
<p>
The ALC-60X laser head is a box about 13-1/8" (L) x 6-1/8" (W) x 4-1/2" (H)
made of goldish colored (alodyned) aluminum with thick ends plates - actually
not part of the box structure but rather the movable parts of the mirror
mounts.
<p>
The primary structure is composed of three, 3/8" InVar rods placed near 3 of
the 4 edges of the box.  They are bolted to the fixed portion of the mirror
mounts at each end.  The rods extend through these plates and another pair
of thick plates - the moving part of the mirror mounts.  They terminate in the
large hex (you have to use a wrench) mirror adjustment screws.
<ul>
<li>OC (Output Coupler) End.  The OC mirror is mounted in a cell which is
 bolted to the end-plate and fits over the Brewster stem of the ion tube with a
 loose O-ring seal.  A small box with a 45 degree beamsplitter glass is
 bolted onto the end-plate in the beam path and redirects a small percentage
 of the beam to the photocell light sensor.  Take care if you remove this
 unit as the beamsplitter glass just sits in place with an O-ring behind it.
 When replacing it, the AR coated side should face out (else the calibration
 of the built-in light meter may be off).  A shielded wire runs inside to the
 light control card.  There is a 1/8" copper tube (which served some unknown
 purpose in its former life) sticking out of this box.  This is the actual
 output aperture.
<p>
<li>HR (High Reflector) End.  This is pretty much the same as the OC but lacks
 the light sensor box and copper tube.
<p>
<li>Front Panel and Connector.  (See: <A HREF="60xpanel.jpg">60X Control
 Panel</A>)  This includes:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The Main Umbilical Connector.  (The mating connector is AMP Part number
   206612-1).  Includes all power and signals from the power supply.
 <p>
 <li>Test Points for tube current and light sense and Test pushbutton.
 <p>
 <li>Light Control pot.
 <p>
 <li>Power and Fault LEDs.
 </ul>
 <p>
<li>Fan connector.  This looks like a PC disk drive power connector and
  provides AC to the head fan and a expects a jumper for its interlock.  CHECK
  THE WIRING of this connector with an ohmmeter to confirm pinout - using the
  wrong pins could ruin your whole day!  (As in, blow the power supply and/or
  head.)
<p>
<li>Total Running Time Meter.  Depending on the particular model (ALC or Omni,
 possibly serial number), this may run on AC or 15 VDC from the light sense
 card.
<p>
<li>Fan Port.  Approximately 4"x4" opening in the middle of the top for the
 HUGE fan.  In its original typesetter or whatever application, there must
 have been a duct to a high volume blower sucking air out of this opening.
 For hobby use, if you use a Patriot style fan, it must be mounted with a 1
 inch or so standoff to provide proper airflow sucking out of the box.  If the
 fan is mounted flush, much of it is blocked.  See: <A HREF=
 "http://www.laserfx.com/Backstage.LaserFX.com/Hobby/IndexHobby.html">LaserFX
 Backstage Laser Hobbyists Page</A> for fan mounting information.
 You can also use a centrifugal
 blower sucking air from this opening if it has an adequate CFM (Cubic Feet
 per Minute) rating.  (The Patriot fan is rated about 400 CFM at 0" Hg -
 to/from free air.)  I've also used the vacuum blower from an ancient 9
 track tape drive for cooling argon ion lasers.  For testing you can even
 use a (gasp!) vacuum cleaner if you can couple it to the head or sit the
 intake on top of the laser!  Make sure it has a new filter. :)
<p>
 I mounted the fan on a 1 inch standoff made from a strip of 1/16" aluminum,
 about 20 inches in length, formed into a roughly 6 inch ring (with a couple of
 flats to accommodate the actual shape of the Patriot fan).  A slightly used
 bicycle inner tube was slipped over the ring prior to its ends being joined
 which acts as a gasket and protects the 60X's "high quality finish". :)  This
 avoided the need to buy an 8 foot length of 6" PVC (as recommended at the
 above site) for just a 1" long piece.  Can you believe my junk box didn't
 have one of those!?  Two 8-32 holes were threaded into the 60X cover into
 which 2" long screws were installed from below to act as mounting studs.
</ul>
<p>
For the complete schematic of the ALC laser head, see the section:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom1">Omnichrome 150R Power Supply and 532 Laser Head
(Omni-150R/532)</A>.  The Omni-532 is identical electrically to the ALC-60X in
all major respects.
<p>
The interior is dominated by the 60X ion tube, its riser box with the main core
heat sinks (2) and the anode and cathode heat sinks (the latter with its
thermal protector).  The tube is mounted on four 6-32 studs that are insulated
from the chassis and provide height adjustment to center it with respect to
the optics at either end.
<p>
A pair of dessicant flasks are mounted on the wall on the panel-side of the
box.  These are connected by rubber tubes to the mirror mounts (or should
be).  They are filled with a silica gel dessicant to absorb moisture and
thus keep the optics in a dry environment.  They also allow the air inside
the optics assemblies to expand as the temperature changes but remain isolated
from the dirty outside air (like all that messy toner).  If your 60X arrived
with the rubber tubes disconnected or missing, the silica gel likely needs to
be revived (heated in an oven to drive out the moisture) or replaced, and the
optics will probably benefit from a good cleaning.
<p>
The ignite card is mounted on the opposite wall and contains everything except
the large blocking diode which is mounted separately on its own heat sink.
<p>
The light sense preamp card is mounted at the output-end of the box.
<p>
All the wiring in the ALC-60X is the same boring white (at least after you get
all the toner off of it!) and bundled together so tracing anything is virtually
impossible.  You have to use the schematic and an ohmmeter!

<h3><A NAME="argtsa3">Steve's Favorite Questions About the ALC-60C/Omni-532</A></h3>
<ul>
<li>Question: Why can't I have my 60X refilled with krypton?
<p>
 Answer: It is possible but you would only get 15 to 20 mW of red or 7 mW of
 yellow but not both at the same time.  (Maybe slightly more, see the section:
 <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtsa9">Comparison of Argon and Krypton Ion Tube
 Characteristics</A>.)
<p>
<li>Question: Can I get a watt or two out of a 60X if I water-cooled it?"
<p>
 Answer: No.  Water cooling it will not increase available power as you are
 limited by the cathode and what the PSU can source off of the 115 VAC line
 not to mention needing 2 or three isolated cooling loops.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="argtsa6">The Intracavity Prism</A></h3>

This won't be present if the laser was set up for all-line or fixed single
line operation using single-line optics as is quite likely with surplus heads.
<p>
On the opposite end of the output aperture, there may be something that looks
like an angled mirror or prism covered with a metal cap.  This is called an
intracavity prism and is used to select which line lases.  It operates by
deflecting each of the lines by a slightly different amount - as any ordinary
self-respecting prism would to create a spectrum. :-)  Only photons of the
selected wavelength make it through the prism-mirror combination in such a way
that they bounce back down the bore of the cavity and contribute to the lasing
process.  (The intracavity prism can be replaced with a broadband mirror for
all the lines to lase.)  Turning the vertical adjust nut/screw/knob on the
rear mirror will select the line.  Set the current at around 8 to 9 A when you
adjust it.  Beware of touching adjustments on the prism itself. 
<p>
A common type is called a "Brewster prism".  An example is shown in
<A HREF="brwprsm1.jpg">Wavelength Tuning Assembly using Brewster Prism</A>.
This shows such an optic mounted between the Brewster stem of a 60X type tube
and the HR mirror.  A precision screw (not visible in the photo) allows the
angle of the prism to be adjusted to select wavelengths.
<p>
One elegant way of implementing the prism-mirror combination is with a single
element called a Littrow prism.  The Littrow prism is shaped in such a way
that light entering its front surface at its Brewster angle is refracted by
the precise amount needed such that it reflects back along the identical path
from the prism's rear surface.  If this is broadband HR coated for the
wavelength range of interest, there will be essentially <b>no</b> losses when
oriented correctly within the cavity of a polarized laser (e.g., using a tube
with Brewster windows).  However, the angle of refraction does change very
slightly with wavelength so that the Littrow prism can be used for line
selection by adjusting its precise orientation with a micrometer knob.

<h3><A NAME="argtsa8">ALC-60X Tube Voltage and Life Expectancy</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).) 
<p>
I've seen tubes down to 99 V (at around 10A)  and still working, but the
usual range is 101 to 115 V for a X tube, with 101 V being dying and 115 V
being overfilled.  This depends on many factors including tube bore (not all
tubes you may find in a 60X head have the same size bore) and fill pressure.
It's a rough guide used by techs working on a system to judge performance
and remaining life, usually done by comparing the voltage at a reference
current while watching a power meter, and then checking against the factory
test sheet for that given tube.  You really need a reference to go by, it is
not an absolute method unless you have a pile of tubes for comparison tests
or the factory sheet for a given model and submodel.  That is why nothing more
specific can really be given here.

<h3><A NAME="argexte">About Those Extra Electrodes on Some ALC-60X
 Tubes</A></h3>

On some older 60X tubes, you will find a thin wire electrode on each Brewster
stem which connects to the interior via a glass-metal seal (but clears the
bore) and is wired into the starter card - but have nothing to do with
starting.
<p>
These are called "catenodes" and are there to aid in keeping residual dust
inside off the Brewster windows.  They were included before the source of
carbon dust in these tubes was eliminated.  The catenodes work by neutralizing
the charge on any particle before it could hit the window using a soft glow
discharge from the wire to the inside of the tube.  The plasma greatly
accelerates any dust in the tube toward the most neutral place - the Brewster
windows, which are the last places you want it!  They were no longer required
once better processing techniques allowed by hard-sealed windows became
available.  A few older SP medium and large frame ion lasers also used to have
them. 
<p>
The catenodes do not particularly aid in starting and the tube will run just
fine without them.  However. the boost voltage on the start card is the only
voltage high enough in the PSU to fight the tube and cathode drop.  They only
need a few hundred microamps to function so the connections are via 88K
resistors.  All 60X start cards have the pads for the resistors, even after
they stopped making tubes with the catenodes.

<h3><A NAME="argtsa9">Comparison of Argon and Krypton Ion Tube
 Characteristics</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
A fresh 60X argon ion tube should drop about 106 to 109 Volts at 10 amps doing
95 to 107 mW, all lines, with TEM00 optics.  This would typically mean a 60 or
200 cm radius output coupler (OC) and a flat high reflector (HR).  It outputs
about 200 mW with a 60 cm radius OC and a 60 cm radius HR.  Of course the
diameter and divergence suffer!
<p>
Larger bore 60X tubes designed for argon can be converted to krypton.
However pure krypton is usually not an option for most 60X tubes as the bore
and gas return are much smaller then required. Although adding 30 to 40% argon
will help with the problem of the igniter pulse blowing the krypton out,
stability is hard to achieve.  Adding a ballast tank with a large flow path
to the cathode-end can cure some of the problems by surrounding the cathode
with gas when the krypton is sucked down the bore by cataphoresis. Gas
velocities in an ion tube can reach 30 cm/second in larger tubes and the
argon and krypton have a tendency to separate to different ends of the
tube making the discharge unstable.  Krypton really needs larger gas
returns and some form of ballast.  In modern water cooled lasers, ballasting
is handled by the spaces between the bore disks and the large cathode bell. 
<p>
Due to Paschen's law, in some cases the krypton gas will find a low
current, low amperage discharge down a long return path to be more
sustainable then a direct path down the short bore. One company compensates
for this by adding a card to their mixed gas power supplies with a
comparator.  If the supply senses a ignited return path the current will be
much lower then the normal idle and the supply will then start pulsing the
igniter till the tube lights down the bore. 
<p>
When filled with krypton, the same tube with a 45 cm radius OC and a 45 cm
radius HR outputs 647 nm and 676 nm red at about 35 mW while dropping
ONLY 85 volts at 10 A. These were the only optics we could find, and were
less then optimal. 
<p>
Krypton runs at a lower voltage, but unlike argon which is a semi-log curve
in output versus current, krypton has a knee curve for gain.  There is a
certain threshold above which all hell breaks loose. I doubt we were at that
threshold and we didn't have time to experiment with the pressure of the
fill.  Below the curve you get mostly 676 nm. A 60X emitting a cherry red
beam is a rare sight indeed and we did it just to see if it could be done
as many people told us it could not be! We even took it to a conference
to ensure witnesses!
<p>
More recently, Steve did the following:
<p>
An air-cooled 60X filled with krypton will tend to lase on just the 482
nm blue line at lower pressure then transition over to some 568 nm with less
blue, then finally the 647 and 676 nm lines will lase with yellow being
long gone. This is if you can get it to ignite stably in pure Kr and add a
big ballast.  There actually can be a crossover region between yellow and
red with NO lasing of either!
<p>
Note that Gold box power supplies are highly stressed to nearly explosive
running a 85 volt tube at 10 or 11 amps.  Note also that a Kr+ tube needs
to be driven much harder for a given power level, so the 11 amps at a lower
tube voltage is approaching the more normal conditions of 1,600 watts in
argon operation, but is still hard on the PSU and is vulnerable to acoustic
plasma oscillations inside the tube.  Acoustic in this case means 20 to
60 kHz and these oscillations can rip apart a PSU. I have already distroyed one
PSU testing this, but switching to the destruction proof resistor PSUs
decreases your chances of a long tube life during initial processing by
ignoring oscillations you may not see in the beam. A hybrid of resistor and
linear is required, as well as a variable energy igniter, as its easy to
blow out a krypton arc with a hot ignite pulse. While a different igniter
helps, having more voltage across the unlit tube boosts chances of a
cathode spot forming and the discharge starting. A "simmer" power supply
similar to those used in arc lamps may also be a aid in starting. 
<p>
You also need white light or red optics with a 0.5% or less transmission
in the red and need the multimode 60/60cm RoC configuration to achieve 
any decent level of power. We're talking about maybe 30 mW here unless you
have a real large bore high power tube or a factory krypton tube and the
tube redone was a working argon doing 110 mW or more with a fresh cathode.
It will be hard to achieve white balance, with pure Kr you generally end
up with one of the following three combinations: "bright yellow, dim blue",
"dim red, dim yellow, and dim blue at very low powers", or "brighter
red and bright blue" at higher pressures. Adding argon gets you RGB and
higher overall power up to a point at the cost of total loss of yellow.
Argon raises the tube voltage, making it more acceptable to the PSU, but
red starts falling as the pressure rises and the percentage of Kr decreases
in the tube.  It's a tricky balancing act.  The 488 nm line of argon will tend
to dominate if argon is added, with the 482 nm Kr blue falling off due to its
higher ionization voltage.
<p>
(From: LaserguruChris (laserguruchris@aol.com).)
<p>
Krypton gas gets "burned" off a lot faster then argon requiring a much bigger
gas ballast so they physically will not fit inside a 60X laser head. Power
output is really low as well at this size, no more then about say 20 or so mW
at balls to the walls current at a wavelength that is laser pointer red at
647 nm. This is not cost effective compared with say diode lasers or helium
neon lasers.
<p>
Nevertheless one such laser does exist, and while not pure krypton it does
contain it. This tube is designed to lase on lines of both krypton and argon.
While basically similar to a typical air-cooled argon ion laser tube, it has
a large external gas ballast tank and would not fit inside a 60X head.
It is used in a strange medical device called cytomeric analyzer (sort of a
cross between a laser particle counter, an absorption spectrophotometer, and
a high presure liquid chromatograph).  These machines used to use a HeNe
laser for counting and a filtered broadband light source to do the detecting.
The multiple wavelengths of the white light laser make this machine work much
faster as the sorting and counting can be done at the same time. 

<h3><A NAME="argc543">The Larger Omni-543 Laser Head with Omni-160 Power
 Supply</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
The Omni-543 comes in variants from 300 mW to 800 mW.  The PSU is very
similar to an Omni-150, but may have 4 MOSFETs in series-parallel instead
of the normal 2 in series.  The filter caps will be in series instead of
parallel and the filament transformer will be a 220 VAC model.
<p>
There is a long glass tube in the laser head which is a gas ballast. 
Take extreme care as that ballast tank is exceedingly fragile!!! Don't
even set it down on a table hard!  Maybe 1/2 G of force max!   The
short rubber tubes are the connectors to the dessicant flasks for the B-windows
and mirrors.  Otherwise the thing is basically an Omni-532 with twice the
arc length and different bore diameter.  As expected, it needs about twice
the cooling as the Omni-532.
<p>
The tube voltage is high enough that it probably only will run 220.
<p>
The Omni-160 power supply is basically similar to the Omni-150 but with
additions specifically for the higher tube voltage and possibly for use
with White Light (Ar/Kr) ion laser heads:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Option 1:</b>  A small grenade sized boost transformer on the 110 VAC
 models to handle higher tube voltages.
<p>
<li><b>Option 2:</b> (This I've actually seen.)  A small daughter card added
 to the control loop  for Kr or White Light service.   This card controls
 igniters in the Kr and White Light units.  If the tube ignites down a
 return path, the tube voltage is higher and the current is about 2 amps.
 A comparator circuit senses this and triggers the igniter until the arc
 goes down the bore as it should.  Argon heads do not have the control
 optoisolator hooked up, so Kr/WL heads used on a argon configured PSU
 keep igniting even when the arc is lit, not a good situation.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="argcswl">Converting a Small Air-Cooled Argon Ion Laser to
 Whitelight</A></h3>

So you have an ALC-60X tube that's dead or produces unimpressive power and
you'd like to convert it to spectacular RGB whitelight.  In a few words,
it's probably not worth it.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The four big issues are:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Cost of optics:</b>  $700 to $1,300 a set, plus tighter tolerance on
 low transmission optics.  A tenth of a percent difference can kill lasing
 on a small tube, while it would be tolerated on a small frame with a longer
 tube.  Getting a coating house to agree to that tight a tolerance means you
 need to pay for their mistakes.  Since the minimum order is about 15 sets
 to get a run done......
<p>
<li><b>Gas return bore diameter:</b>  On most air-cooled lasers, the
 gas return line is not big enough for adequate krypton flow.  (Note: This
 is probably true even of commercial systems like the Omni (now Melles Griot)
 643, see the previous section).
<p>
<li><b>Cataphoresis:</b>  This separates the argon-krypton mix, meaning your
 Kr is at one end of the tube and Ar is at the other.  This is a function of
 bore size and it kills power in small tubes.
<p>
<li><b>Tube voltage drop:</b>  This is lower with a mixed gas fill.  Asking
 a supply designed for a 106 V tube to drop down to 75 to 80 V really
 stresses the supply.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Minor issues:</b>
<p>
As for small 488 only tubes designed for tem00, the bore is WAY too
small to support multimode multigas operation, the bore diameter is
designed to limit the mode and prevent you from upgrading a 10 mW tube
to a 300 mW tube.   usually small tubes have a minimal amount of
ceramic in them, and couldn't take the additional heat stress from full
current operation. Cost is important for small argons, and lots of
steps are taken to get that cost down, most of which really limit bore
energy.
<p>
You're better off using a nice 80 mW 658 nm diode and an air-cooled all
lines argon ion laser.  Since a good power supply design can drive an
argon ion laser head to do 200 to 300 mW off of 115 VAC these
days, diving down to ~70 mW of whitelight power is a drag.  Whitelight
tubes do not excite argon directly, a charge transfer effect from the
much heavier Kr atoms pumps the AR, so you can loose a lot of 514 nm and
a big amount of visual punch.
<p>
<b>Exception:</b> Certain tubes do well in a green killed low power red
yellow blue mode, using mostly krypton, at a 5-5-5 mW or 15-15-15 mW
power level. It's visually a blue white in appearance, but not too
useful outside of instrumentation/scientific applications.

<h3><A NAME="argcwlc">Comments on Omni White-Light Conversion</A></h3>

<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> now sells what is
basically an Omni-643 under their label.  There are a number of argon and
argon/krypton versions available.  The Ar/Kr versions aren't of course
a conversion as described below, but probably do use the same tube as
the argon-only 643s.
<p>
I have tested a 643-RYB-A01 which is an Ar/Kr ion laser which produces red
(647 nm), yellow (568 nm), and blue (several lines including 488 nm).
Green is suppressed by the mirror coatings for its intended
application, possibly because green would overwealm the expected fluorescence
signatures being detected. It reaches rated power (47 mW total) at 6.4 A but
will produce over 135 mW at 9.4 A (according to the test sheet that came
with it).
<p>
However, a funny thing happens at about 8.6 A (assuming the test point
calibration is correct):  The color balance suddenly changes to less yellow
and more blue and/or red AND the current drops to about 6 or 7 A.  It has been
suggested that this is hitting the gas return limit whereby the argon and
krypton circulate at different rates and thus the gas fill mix in the bore
changes.  It's necessary to drop the current back down to near idle at which
point the color balance changes back, equally suddenly.  So, I'm not sure
how it was tested at 9.4 A or whether perhaps it needs to be run for awhile
to correct the gas pressure, having not been used for at least several months.
<p>
In fact, I measured approximately 150 mW total at just under the transition
current, maybe 8.4 A.  So, too bad about the gas return limit.  Otherwise,
it could go much higher!
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
White Omni-643s have the same basic tube bore diameter as the higher powered
argon version.  Converting an argon ion 643 to white-light is possible.
Max power would be about 60 to 70 mW assuming the tube has a good cathode.
The mix would be almost all krypton, much more then a few percent argon, and
it fails to start easily.  Whenever we try to up the argon ratio for more green
power, we can't start the thing, and you need a 220 VAC supply or a boost
transformer. Others who have white-lighted these have made the same
comment, getting a gas mix that will stay lit and deliver green power
is tedious.
<p>
However, I wouldn't white-light it, I'd yellow/red it.  They scream with
a RYB optic and you can get mondo yellow. that yellow is a gorgeous
golden yellow, and if you have a little blue coming out you get a beam
that appears bluish white.  Add the red, dial out some blue and a it's a
color you'd never see on a TV or monitor phosphor or any other light source,
a very radiant saturated "Sunkist" orange. If you ever get, say a Lexel-95
krypton, put in a RYB OC optic from an air-cooled laser, and a broad-band HR,
and you get the same orange, but much more of it. Most laser techs like the
647-488 or 633-488 mix, known in the laser show biz as "Atomic
Flamingo Magenta", but I like the 647-482-568 (or 575) Orange!
<p>
If you use the standard Omni optics you get a really intense yellow
line, a nice 647 nm red line, 488 nm argon and 482 nm krypton blues,
some krypton greens, and the 676 nm Kr line. A buddy of mine has one
on station right now and is experimenting with different mixes.
Strangely, 514 nm argon green hasn't shown up in our tests.
<p>
However, it's a crap-shoot on rebuilding small tubes. If your tube is
factory and still has a positive or neutral delta-T it is probably a
candidate for repump with a 60/40 chance of some success, if it's been
run with a negative Delta-T, it probably would need a new cathode
installed.  This assumes the Brewsters are squeaky clean on the inside.
Aim a bright HeNe laser beam down the recently cleaned Brewster.  If
there is much scatter from the inside face, then forget it.  Argon with
the much higher gain doesn't get attenuated as bad from the inside scatter.
<p>
The real determination of how well krypton will work in a given tube
is very dependent on the gas returns as well as bore size. Higher
power argon tubes will go krypton, as their returns have higher
capacities. Tubes that were designed for 5 to 30 mW of argon with a small
bore to limit power just wont go red, we can get stable plasmas, but
not in the lasing region.

<h3><A NAME="arg643g">Getting the Green Out of a Melles Griot 643-RYB-A01</A></h3>

On many multiline ion lasers, some lasing wavelengths are deliberately
suppressed either because the application doesn't need or want them, and/or
because they rob power from the desired lines.  For example, the Melles
Griot 643-RYB-A01 Ar/Kr ion laser described in the previous section
has an OC mirror that suppresses *all* green from the output.  So, there
are several blue lines, yellow at 568 nm, and red at 647 nm.  But I really
wanted to see green as well.  I know that the HR mirror is broadband coated
but the obvious approach of replacing the OC mirror
with one coated for all lines would have required a mirror that fit
physically, partial disassembly, and realignment of the laser.  Even if I
had such a mirror, this was not something I was looking forward to doing.
<p>
So, I set up an adjustable mirror mount just in front of the output aperture
of the laser and installed the broadband OC from a large-frame argon ion
laser.  Its reflectivity was about 99% from 470 to 520 nm, RoC unknown.
Since there is always output from the normal pair of mirrors in the laser,
it is trivial to align the additional mirror.  There are multiple spots
from the multiple reflections between the auxiliary mirror and original OC.
When all these spots merge into one, the mirror is perfectly aligned, about
30 seconds on a bad day.  Near that point, a nice strong green output
appeared in addition to the original red, yellow, and blue.  However,
the green was excessively powerful, cutting the intensity of the yellow
line significantly.  The reflectivity of the new mirrors was too high
at the green wavelength.
<p>
So, I replaced the first mirror with one having a reflectivity of around
96.5% from 470 to 520 nm and an RoC of 2 meters.  That restored most of the
yellow with some reduction in the green.  Only one green line, probably at
530 nm, was present.  But there was an additional blue line not prevsiously
present at idle current.  A mirror coated for somewhere between 90 and 95% at
530 nm (narrow band) would probably be ideal to produce a balanced RYGB
laser but I had exhausted my inventory of suitable mirrors. :)
<p>
In both cases, the output was quite stable with none of the unpredictable
behavior associated with trying similar stunts with lower gain HeNe lasers.
The color balance remained about the same (visually) as the current was
increased from 4 A to 8 A.
<p>
CAUTION: With the high photon flux between the OC mirror and auxiliary
mirror, the monitor photodiode is totally saturated so that light feedback
always operates at the lowest (idle) power setting regardless of knob
position.  Therefore, only current mode could be used to increase the
output power.  The photodiode was undamaged but I'm not sure that can
be guaranteed at higher power in current mode and/or with a higher
reflectivity auxiliary mirror.

<h3><A NAME="arg60bp">Boosting Air-Cooled Ion Tube Power Using
 Magnets?</A></h3>

Water-cooled ion lasers generally have a solenoid type magnet surrounding the
tube to concentrate and center the discharge.  This both stabilizes the arc
and boosts power output.  Either a set of permanent magnets or an
electromagnet (probably with adjustable current) fed from the main power
supply may be used.
<p>
Some companies offer permanent magnet kits for use on specific models of
air-cooled ion lasers.  Do these work or are they in the same class as
magnetic water treatment?  What if anything can you expect from a $50 to $200
investment?  Is there an alternative using materials found around the house?
<p>
The first problem is that there really isn't any good place to put magnets
in most air-cooled ion laser heads.  With the massive heat sink/cooling fins
surrounding the tube, the magnets can't be placed close to the bore where they
will do the most good.  Therefore, they must be much more powerful than the
type used with water-cooled tubes.  There really isn't much space to put a
large solenoid in a 60X type laser head which limits you to a series of
permanent magnets with the same pole facing inward toward the axis of the
bore.  They would have to be very powerful magnets being so much further away
from outside the head sinks.  Getting any sort of uniformity out of such an
arrangement would be tough.
<p>
With some tube/head designs like those used by SP and NEC, this might just
be impossible with their square/rectangular heat sinks.  For the ALC-60X
and Cyonics tubes with cylindrical heat sinks, there may be space - barely.
But, being unable to implement a continuous, uniform, axial magnetic field,
don't expect anything dramatic.
<p>
In the end, even the advertising for these add-ons only claim a 20 percent
improvement at most.  As noted below, actual performance may be much less
than this.  And, the power may even decrease.  The only way to confirm any
change would be with a laser power meter - your Mark-I eyeballs and mushware
based CPU won't be able to reliably compare beam brightness before and after
the magnet installation.
<p>
If you have some high strength disk drive positioner rare earth magnets - the
kind requiring a small crowbar to get apart, some spare time on your hands,
a laser power meter, and are willing to risk your laser head should something
go wrong like a magnet working loose at the wrong time, you can try some
experiments.  Several identical (same strength) magnets will need to be
arranged equally spaced around the tube - preferably at multiple locations.
They must NOT interfere with airflow and be placed such that their fields are
not short circuited by ferrous parts close to the tube.  They must also be
securely mounted.  All must have the same poles (N or S) facing toward the
bore.
<p>
In the end, increasing the tube current by .5 A will probably be a more
reliable way of boosting power output by an equal amount (of course, there
will be some decrease in tube life, but you can't have everything!).
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
One, you need a high temp magnet, most wont hack the repeated thermal cycles.
If they heat up above their Curie point, any magnetism is history.  One
company had been offering an add-on electromagnet.  Radio Shack magnets need
not apply for this position - they will heat up, drop off and block airflow.
(They are also quite weak in comparison to what may be needed - Sam.)
<p>
Two, you need a fresh tube, with lots of green, as the green lines appear to
be the field sensitive ones.  The gain using a non-focused magnet structure
(which is what you're likely to get) is a pittance of that obtained with a
proper electromagnet around the bore.  It's also strongly current dependent,
and doesn't work at low currents or on tubes at low pressure.  Don't bother
unless your laser is already doing at least 80 mW.  That's from multiple tests
on multiple tubes. 
<p>
Three, only certain 60Xs work with this, the ones with soft iron rings around
the cooling fins, inside the riser box. Because thats where the magnets go.
They get stuck on the rings, like poles facing inward (usually 3 magnets per
ring or 6 magnets per ring) to form a soft theta pinch on the plasma.  One
magnet having more or less strength then any of the others can mess you up.
We're talking magnets you can barely separate by hand. 
<p>
Some stats:
<PRE>
                ---- Output -----  --- Net Gain ----
                 Before   After     Power   Percent   Cost
                -------------------------------------------
                  62 mW    67 mW     5 mW     8.1 %    NA
                  80 mW    87 mW     7 mW     8.8 %   $50
                 117 mW   135 mW    18 mW    15.4 %   $70 
</PRE>
However, on many tubes, no net gain was observed, and never on any tube below
45 mW.  The largest gain was still much less than 20 percent even on the
'hottest' tube.  (Where cost is given, it is for an array of magnets.)
<p>
What you really are doing is not creating a true radial plasma pinch, but
perhaps moving a distorted streak of plasma around inside the tube and just
happen to stumble on a path with more gain, as these magnet arrays have
poor field shapes.  And, it's possible to go down as well as up. 
<p>
In conclusion, in cases where this works, it's only really at high current,
it's hard to get those magnets into place, and you have to disassemble the
riser to position them.  Not a task for the timid.

<h3><A NAME="argplim">Power Limitation of Air-Cooled Tubes</A></h3>

So, why can't you replace the killer fan with a jet blower or some sort of
water cooling system and get much more power from your air-cooled tube?  Aside
from the practical issues of plumbing and having line voltage in the midst of
water, there are more fundamental reasons why this probably wouldn't work even
though some ion tubes like the Cyonics/Uniphase may use pretty much the same
cathode/filament for their 10 mW tubes as their 5 W ones.
<p>
One might also want to do this simply to eliminate the roar of the killer fan
without exceeding the normal current limits.  However, even this may not be
easy.  Here is a post mortem report from someone who actually tried water
cooling an air-cooled argon ion tube:
<p>
(From: Dr. Destroyer of Lasers.)
<p>
I got the bright idea that it would be swell to water cool an air-cooled
laser head, not so much to boost power as to not have to deal with the noise
of the fan.  After doing some experimentation, I constructed a shroud out of
food tins and shim stock.  I had decided to use the wet anode and just accept
the fact that it would result in some current leakage.  This of course, is
very dangerous from a safety with electricity standpoint.  I took appropriate
precautions, grounded the chassis, never went near it with power applied, etc.
<p>
For several hours, it appeared to be working and I was so happy having a
silent laser!  But then the anode seal failed.  What seemed to be
the factor was the apparent electrolysis of the anode.  When I dissected the
laser after removing all electricity and disconnecting the power supply from
the laser,  it appeared that it had rusted!!!  Although iron/steel does rust
in water, it shouldn't fail after less than 10 hours.
<p>
The temperature didn't seem to be a problem, but for all I know this was 
what hurt it.  Perhaps the differential of outside to the inside of the 
anode.  I do not know what exactly what did it in but I am sure the anode 
corrosion played a significant part
<p>
The bottom line is don't try to water cool an air-cooled argon laser - or at
least you now know how <i>not</i> to do it!
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The only reason you can't scorch a 60X or other air-cooled tube is the anode
and the anode seal (and others agree with this). If you could make a longer
anode with an order of magnitude better cooling and then boost the airflow as
well, it would be a 350 mW laser. Spectra-Physics' older "glass" 161s are the
same tube design as the larger 164/168/171s, just a shorter bore and smaller
anode - the only other changes being the lack of a fill system, water jacket,
and a different gas return.  Expensive experiment, however. The scaling limit
is actually the length of the tube and lack of a magnet. So if the SP-161's
gas return were redesigned to fit inside a magnet and a water jacket were
glassed on, and the anode had a wet "anode block" mechanism for cooling like
the big ones, yes it would be a high power tube.  But you also need a
electrical system that lets you have a "wet" anode, and that's not easy when
powered single-phase.
<p>
National does make a couple of wet versions of its tubes, and NEC also
once made a 20 mW wet unit, as National has replacement tubes for it on
their Web page.

<h3><A NAME="argnnlc">Notes on National Laser Corporation 60X Replacement
 Tubes</A></h3>

<A HREF="http://www.nationallaser.com/">National Laser</A> manufactures
air-cooled ion laser systems using permanently aligned internal mirror
tubes, replacement ion tubes, conversion kits available to install their
tubes in laser heads from UP, SP, ALC, MG, ILT, and NEC.
<p>
(From: Stethman Grayson (sgrayson@attbi.com).)
<p>
The NLC-60i tube has a large cathode end-bell with a 2.5" 'extension'
on which the HR is mounted. That extension basically terminates 1/8th of
an inch from the original 60X external HR mirror cavity.  (Close fit,
huh?)  The tech at National Laser said that these tubes were used as
replacements for the 60X and NEC 3030 and that the nominal voltage drop
for a new tube is about 105 to 107 V at 9.5 A with with end-of-life at
about 90 to 92 V.
<p>
The NLC-61i is the next-generation replacement tube for the 60X heads.  The
61i is the same form-factor as the 60i, just superior output quality and
power.

<h3><A NAME="argcsf">Comments on Conversion to Single Frequency
 Operation</A></h3>

The following was prompted by a request for information on adding an
etalon to the 60X laser head from an Albion Instruments anesthesia
analyzer for use in holography applications.  The tubes in these machines
(shown in <A HREF="aiaa1.jpg">Albion Instruments Anesthesia Analyzer
Argon Ion Laser Head</A>) have very high quality optically contacted
Brewster windows and an extended intracavity space (where the gas sample
chamber original was located).
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The 60X/532 tubes from anesthesia analyzers are medium power tubes, they do
have quite a bit of gain but probably not enough to run single frequency with a
true etalon and single line prism.  An etalon is usually a 15 mm diameter
solid block of fused silica about 12 mm long, with special coatings on usually
one if not both surfaces for 1 to 10% reflectivity, carefully picked by the
design team for a given wavelength and intracavity power. For higher power
ion lasers the etalon is a set of two air-spaced silica disks, again with a
highly specialized coating that is optimized for a specific wavelength and
gain.
<p>
Since it's not a standard option on air-cooled lasers, you'd need to develop
your own chunk of custom coated silica.  You might get it with just sticking
in a carefully tuned microscope slide, for short periods of time, but it would
be a VERY frustrating exercise to keep that stable.
<p>
The etalon is typically mounted in a heater assembly that is stable to about
0.001 &deg;C or better, and thats going to be extremely hard to
achieve on a air cooled laser. You then end up with the normal trouble
of tuning the end mirror and prism plus having a unstable element that
is very alignment sensitive and temperature sensitive, it typically
takes 45 minutes for the system to settle down on a water cooled small
frame, and small changes in how the intracavity beam heats the etalon
by adsorption can cause major, major fluctuations in output power, not
to mention huge mode jumps.
<p>
At best on a large frame water-cooled laser you get about 0.5 to 0.6
times the single line power measured without the etalon, do to the
short gain space on a 60X, I'd say you'd get maybe 10 mW max of
stabilized 488 with a hot tube.
<p>
On a naturally unstable laser like an air-cooled argon ion, additional
steps would need to be taken to slightly and actively adjust the cavity
length, like the addition of a piezo tweeter on the rear mirror to
adjust cavity length to favor a single mode and single gain line,
locked to an iodine cell absorption line.
<p>
We do that here at my day job, we have a etalon equipped medium frame
lexel with a active iodine cell that is kicked in to adjust the cavity
length. You can visually watch it mode jump and fluctuate in intensity
for about a hour. it will fluctuate from 0.1 watt to 1.5 watts as it
warms up.
<p>
You're better off getting a used lexel 85 with a prism and water
cooling.  It will run off single phase 220.  Some experimenters on this group
have modified DPSS lasers with heaters and TE coolers to achieve much
better stability then you could ever get out of a air cooled argon. 
<p>
If you can get the cooling fan vibrations damped out enough for
holography, you may find coherence length is not a big issue, holograms
are made with diode lasers all the time.
<p>
As for etalons, you won't find many of them  on ebay (maybe one every two
years has show up) as there are very few of them out there, most users of ion
lasers don't have the patience or the training or the instruments to
use them properly.
<p.
Any 1 meter class water cooled argon usually has enough stability to
do what you want with just a prism and intracavity aperture, provided
you keep the water temperature reasonably constant.
<p>
May I suggest that you might consider using a 15 mW HeNe laser instead. :)
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Interesting that the remains of my Carson dual tube Ar/Kr ion laser
which had both a line selecting prism and etalon didn't have any
thermal stabilization within the etalon assembly.  Unless the entire
laser was temperature controlled, there was none.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argold0">The Really Strange Carson Dual Tube Ion
Laser</A>)
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
That would be a witchy job to tweak, it probably would come into its
own in about two hours of running, then very very slight movements of
its mount or the prism would get you your desired mode.
<p>
If you think a 60X mirror mount is crude, an etalon is 20X more
touchy. But at least its behavior is somewhat predictable.
<p>
There is a reason laser scientists of old started the lasers at 5 or 6
in the morning, then graded or wrote papers for two hours, then experimented
for two hours after the rush hour instabilities, then ate lunch.
<p>
The active iodine stabilization circuit for the Lexel, which is about
6 op-amps and a ton of temperature compensation devices, is well worth
its weight in gold once it locks. It heats the resonator rods to lock
up the loop with 20 to 40 watt phase controlled heater tapes on each
resonator rod. A separate heater circuit disciplines the etalon.

<h3><A NAME="argtaca">Types of Air-Cooled Argon Ion Laser Tubes</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
There are two major subclasses of tubes,
<p>
A. Those are small tubes with a tapered bore designed for a long life, no
significant power, controlled TEM00 mode over entire life, single line
or a few lines, at a few mW or maybe 20 mW max, built in such a
way to be hard to rebuild or upgrade, usually 488, 457, 477, or more
rarely 514 nm. They are almost never multiline and intended for graphic
arts or small hospital lab applications.  In older days these were glass
like the NEC 2020 or Siemens.  Nowadays they are built as a small compact brazed
module with short or non-existent mirror stems and a small cathode.
They have a very well defined  lifetime, but if  you crank the current
up, they die quickly.  They are a "minimalist" design and the
manufacturers spent 20 years refining it.  They have a number of cost
tradeoffs designed to enhance sales.  Rebuilding them is risky although
there are cases where if you have hundreds or thousands of units in
service its probably worth it.
<p>
I have two 60Xs rotting in my garage. Both tubes are identical length
and look identical externally.  One is the tapered low power class. It
has a nice fill pressure and the correct Delta-T on the cathode, so it's
healthy.  But, no matter what optics set I put on it, I get only 5 to
7 mW of 488 nm TEM00, and maybe a trace - a hundred microwatts - of 457 nm.
No other lines lase, even single line green optics or two green HRs back to
back.  Just 488 nm.  This is known as gain saturation.  It starts to complain
to the power supply if I try to run it at more then 6 or 7 amps.  The gain
plateaus at 8 amps no matter what.  The other one is a wide bore, lets
call it a SBPT.  It's old and needs a gas refill and a new cathode, but
it does 60 to 70 mW of multiline, multimode, and its response changes
nicely as a I change optics sets and keeps climbing with additional
current. I'd never run a 110 VAC ALC product at more then 10 amps anyways,
so it increases in gain up to that point and I suspect would still be
climbing, even slightly.
<p>
B. The other class is what we might call "straight bore power tube".
SBPT pretty much says it all. The bore is not always straight either,
usually a significant flare at the ends to help with erosion.  SBPTs
have large shielded gas returns from cathode end bell to anode end
bell.  SBPTs are worth rebuilding and upgrading in some cases,
especially if you have a hundred or more of them.  SBPT lifetime is
pretty much inverse exponential to tube current, see the lifetime chart
in the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrtle0">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser
Tube Life</A> copied from the manual of a high power air-cooled laser.
The old way of getting long life at 20 mW was to buy a high powered tube
and run it at much lower then rated current.  The old huge (room sized)
Xerox high speed photoprinters that use a 70 to 100 mW tube and run it
at 23.7 mW are a example of this.  The newer tapered low power tubes
have a long life, and lower costs, but no gain over what they need.
They  are also rarer and more expensive.
<p>
If you look at the manufacturers catalog in the tables of model number
versus specifications, it's pretty obvious to see where the line between
the two classes of product starts and stops. 

<h3><A NAME="arg60xbc">Comments on the ALC-60 Series Lasers</A></h3>

The designation "ALC-60" means an OEM sixty series laser.
<p>
The 60X includes any of various output powers in a standard sized box
designed by Xerox, hence the "X".  It was originally mass produced for
Xerox ultra high speed photocopiers with a printing option.  These were
used to print books at several tens of pages per second.  The X copier
laser design spec is 23.7 mW blue and violet lines only in light mode
for 5,000 hours at a starting current of 4 amps and a max end of life
current of 8 amps.
<p>
However the factory made many lasers that were 60X-NNN (dash
numbers after the 60X) which were OEM and scientific lasers at
different wavelengths and powers.  The 60X defines the box the tube is in,
and thats it.
<p>
60B is typically a medium power plate setter laser in a  format
for European use with metric mounting holes, two fans on the side instead
of one on top, a way different hole pattern, and an emission indicator
on top.  It also usually has a way different pinout and a 230 VAC
power supply.  It is the same physical size as the 60X.
<p>
The 60C is a top-fanned low power laser with yet another hole pattern on the
base, probably matches the competing spectra physics hole pattern.  The 60C
also came in krypton with a way different tube.
<p>
Omnichrome competed with ALC for the Xerox contracts, so some
Omnichromes line up with the 60 physically.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The short Omni 532 has a hole pattern and top hight that
 usually matches the 60X.
<p>
<li>The stretched Omni 643 (almost double the length of the Omni 532) tube
 with a much higher tube voltage, designed to run off 230 VAC, available
 in krypton and mixed gas with argon powers up to around 800 mW.
</ul>
<p>
This gets confounded by the fact that many 60Xs out there were rebuilt
by Evergreen and others and they mixed and matched used tubes to meet
their customers needs, and bought old tubes and heads wherever they
could get them. So it is not uncommon to find a 250 mW tube being used
in a photocopier head with a Xerox sticker on the side.
<p>
What actually determines what you get is the bore size, bore length,
bore shape and bore diameter, and the optics installed.  They all have
the same overall tube length, the same cathode, and all are designed
for either a 95 V or 106 V tube voltage and the same tube pressure.
<p>
If they make the bore really tiny and with parallel sides, it can
limit the power to 5 to 20 mW and blue only.  ALC had a patent on
that.  No matter what optics or how much current you ram down that
tube, it's blue only and 20 mW.
<p>
If they make a tapered bore, you get a high powered multimode tube, etc.
<p>
So there is NO easy chart to let you know what your getting, and Only
the factory and the re-builders knew what went into the OEM lasers.
<p>
I have some old charts for the black-cased
scientific models, but the gold-ish color OEM housings could hold
anything!
<p>
And, people change optics sets if they have more then one laser to
play with, so its luck of the draw if you buy one that the owner hasn't
made measurements. And often they have dirty optics and some one sells
it as 20 mW and single line blue when just cleaning the optics makes
it a 100 mW all lines. :-(
<p>
Some numbers of common tubes (all TEM00 vertically polarized, light
controlled power regulation):
<p>
<ul>
<li>60-IS-AL: 25 mW, 488 nm and 514 nm.
<li>60-FL-AL: 50 mW, 457 nm, 476 nm, and 514.5 nm.
<li>60-XAB-AL: 100 mW, 488 nm.

<h2>Typical Small Water-Cooled Argon Ion Lasers - the Lexel Laser
 Models 75 and 88</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argtsw0">Description of a Typical Water-Cooled Argon Ion
 Laser</A></h3>

Lexel argon and kryption ion lasers are probably the second most common types
available on the surplus market.  Depending on particular model and
configuration, they are capable of between a few hundred mW and many WATTs of
output power and may be fitted with single or multiline optics.
<p>
The Lexel Model 75 (henceforth referred to as the Lexel-75) is a small
water-cooled laser, a baby cousin to the Lexel Model 88.  It operates from a
standard 115 VAC line so you don't need to own stock in your local utility
to be able to afford the electricity bills. :)
<p>
Though the output power rating of the Lexel-75 is 100 to 300 mW, some of these
babies will do 450 mW when new.  Because of the better cooling, they will last
a lot longer then their shorter air cooled brethren.
<p>
Without the need for the HUGE cooling fan, the Lexel-75 laser head is a sleak,
streamlined unit.  Of course, there IS the need for that tap water cooling
hookup!

Note the small (narrow) size of the plasma tube compared to air-cooled types
with all their cooling fins obsuring the actual bore.  Note the crud from the
cooling water on the BeO core of the plasma tube. This can result in a 5 to
10% drop in laser power over time. Occasional use of a dilute solution of
"Lime-away" can work wonders on plasma tube lifetime.

The Lexel-75 will also output 528 nm or 1,090 nm with the tuning prism in

The tables below show how the actual voltage across the tube vary with tube
current.  Note that the relationship demonstrates a positive resistance in
the discharge - barely - over the range of a stable plasma.  The incremental
resistance (dV/dI) averages just over an ohm.  I am not quite sure what the
implications of the negative resistance at the point where the discharge
becomes unstable but if the reading is accurate, it can't be good!
<p>
This data was taken from a older 65 to 300 mW tube at middle of life doing
235 mW multiline multimode and its brand new replacement doing 400+ mW.  Make
sure your regulator volts is well in the green!  Unlike the 60X PSU, the Lexel
pass-bank is stressed more at lower amperages.  The Lexel PSU for the model
75 has four 2N6259 transistors instead of the 12 used with the model 88.

<p>
I (Steve) recently serviced a pair of Lexel-75s for a friend.  One was brand
new and did 450 mW initially.  The other did around 230 mW.  (The 450 mW laser
was a new spare for the machine he took the 230 mW laser out of.)  When we ran
the delta-T curve based on graphing the tube's voltage versus current versus
changes in cathode heater voltage, we determined 13.6 A to be a good maximum
number and a little less than 12 A to be a good place to run for a good long
life/power tradeoff.  Of course 9 to 10 A would make it last forever but you
probably don't want to go any lower then 8.  A good rule is that with clean
optics on a Lexel, run it where all 6 major lines come on and leave it there.
<p>
BTW, the 450 mW went down to around 325 mW after three weeks or so of evening
operation.  To take a dive in power and then level off 15% or so above their
rated power for their rated warrranty period of operation is quite normal for
a new argon ion laser.  These numbers are for 477 to 514 nm multiline,
multimode operation.

<h3><A NAME="argtsw3">Lexel-88 Tube Voltage Versus Current and Other
 Information</A></h3>

These lasers are designed to cycle from about 20 mW idling to the treatment
power.  A 1% transmission filter forms the aiming beam of up to 6 mW.  They
have 5 line optics designed for eye surgery.  So: 477, 488, and 514.5 nm are
the main lines, along with one other faint green line and one deep violet line.
All others are killed by the OC. The 514.5 nm line is an option, normally only
the blues are present during surgery.  The single green line is separated from
the main beam using a dichroic filter when a specific type of coagulation is
needed.  The medical controller idles the unit and then pulses it to the
desired power for a programmable time up to a second or so.
<p>
Although the tube and some PSUs are rated for pulsed operation at a very low
duty cycle - and half second pulses or less at 30 A for scorching 4.5 watt eye
treatment bursts - in practice the machine is set for about 2 watts max.
Obviously, as most of the units in circulation are pulls from opthalmic
systems, it's wise to derate them from 2 watts to 1 watt for your own use.
<p>
The manual lists typical readings for the laser operating at full power as
follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Laser current (panel meter): 20 A.
<li>Laser tube voltage: 165 VDC.
<li>Laser filament voltage: 2.65 VAC.
<li>Laser filament current: 27 AAC.
<li>Line current: 29 AAC.
</ul>
<p>
The measurements below were taken from a Lexel-88 tube with the filament on
"B" setting and are actually 2 to 3 V low (indicating slightly low pressure)
according to factory test sheet for a similar tube.  Normal factory reference
is 165 V +/- 1 V at 20 A.  (However, sustained operation at 20 A or more is not
recommended; 13 to 15 A is a nice tradeoff between lifetime and power.)

<b>Notes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>20 A is an INSANE level of current for long term continuous operation.  A
 more reasonable value is 13 to 15 A. Remember this is an industrial unit
 originally designed for pulsed power on demand, coming up from a low idle
 of 8 or 9 amps for no more then 3 seconds at high power. In medical service,
 the maximum an eye surgery controller would demand is 3 watts for 1 second
 or less. 250 to 350 mW is a more typical value used in eye surgery.
<p>
<li>A more typical value of tube voltage at 20 A is 168 V when new.
<p>
<li>The light controller can demand more power from the pass-bank then the
 current control card, but only for short periods of time.  The pass-bank is
 only rated for 10% duty cycle at 30 A or 30 seconds, whichever is less.
<p>
<li>The factory can get away with straining a brand new tube at 20 to 30 A
for short periods of time. The test conditions above are for VERY SHORT
<p>
<li>If no voltage is applied to the light input on the 15 pin connector and
 the unit is switched into light, the tube plasma will go out. Thus
 scientific style light control is not on a 88 psu unless it has
 retrofitted with a extra light control pot.
<p>
<li>The medical optics are spec'd at quote" NO MORE THEN 5% of total
 power can be greater then 514 nm or less then 488 nm"  Hence these optics
 kill 528 nm light and wavelengths below 488 nm are there but very faint,
 15 to 20 mW of 477 nm blue violet shows up at higher currents but no 465
 nm or 457 nm violet will lase. 
<p>
<li>An eye surgery system usually has a green only mode for treating
 certain diseases, where a blue blocking dichroic filter is inserted to
 avoid deep cauterization caused by the blue light, hence the need to be
 able to overdrive the laser for shot periods to get enhanced green.  During
 aiming, a 95% reflective mirror is placed between the laser and the fiber
 coupler to reduce the aiming light to a maximum of 3 mW, which is
 adjustable down to zero by the eye surgeon.

<h3><A NAME="argnarl">Notes on Availability of These Lasers and
 Alternatives</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)   
<p>
Lexel-75s haven't been made in about 4 years (now winter 2000). So,
any tube you get, unless its a cherry stored in some back room some place
unused, is going to be dying when you get it. You need a American 909 or a
HGM 5 (basically a American 68C running pulsed with reduced cooling, but
the PSU will run CW).  Yes, even the famous Lexel-88 is no longer made, but
it is commonly rebuilt and at least two companies make after-market rebuilt
tubes for it.  Lexel still produces the 85 and 95 series however as well as the
3500 series.  An even better goal would be a Laser Physics Reliant.  Try for a
medical HGM, biomed people generally don't know who to clean optics or tweak
resonators, so they scrap a lot of perfectly good lasers. 

<h3><A NAME="argc88s">Comments on Lexel-88 Starting Procedure and
 Behavior</A></h3>

The following was in response to concern on the part of the owner of a
Lexel-88 laser:
<p>
<blockquote>
"The laser fired, ran for 3 to 5 seconds, then clicked off (I heard a
 definite click).  However, the interlock and emission indicator lights
 remained on.  I shut it off, turned the current up a tad, tried it again,
 and same thing happened.  Third try I don't remember what the starting
 current was, but it was probably around 12 amps.  This time the laser stayed
 on, though after the first couple of seconds, I did hear the same (I think)
 click.  I don't recall whether the laser "blinked" slightly when it clicked,
 but it might have.  But the laser ran fine for the rest of the evening
 (12 to 13 amps for about an hour and a half, and 15 amps for about 20
 minutes)."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The one blink after start is normal on lexels, and it's a consequence of the
way the igniter works, not to worry, its a pretty common thing and is not a
sign of a bad tube or system problem. 
<p>
My laser wants to be set at about 11 A for starts, so given that the meters
are not all that accurate from unit to unit and are kind of nonlinear, your
tube is fine.  Remember it can be turned down lower then where it starts
because once they have the arc, they have a enough hot ions to keep things
going. Ions are harder to make when the tube is cold.  You're fine. Starting
amperage shifts upwards as pressure rises, but 1 A is not enough to worry me
given the 5% accuracy of the current knob and the 5 to 10% accuracy of the
meter.
<p> 
But, for the sake of your pass-bank and cathode, you should start with a much
higher current then that, say 15 A.  Cathode sag happens when the cathode is
at a middle temperature of 600 to 700 DegC, tungsten is softened in that range
and it goes through a phase change - above 700 DegC it actually gets stronger,
so during warmup, it's strong, then very soft, then stronger.  So, if the arcs
hotter from the current being up, its out of the dangerous sag period quicker.
If it stays in the sage period for long periods, it will stretch and deform.
Therefore the idea is to get it out of there as soon as possible. A higher
current helps with that.  Cold filaments sag quickly, warm filaments can go
years without sag.  Sag is actually a change in the grain orientation of the
cathode metal, sag occurs during a phase change when it switches state to a
longer thinner grain that can stretch, instead of the normal grainy structure
which crosses at right angles at random along the metal. 
<p>
As for the pass-bank, being full on means it is really almost a short circuit 
once the tube starts to conduct, thus protecting it from the ignite spikes,
by allowing them to pass through. when that tube first glows, it nearly
totally discharges the filter cap right through the pass-bank, so to
protect the transistors, turn it up for starts. This is in nearly every
Spectra-Physics and Coherent manual. 

<h3><A NAME="arglexwh">Comments on Regassing Lexel White Light Ar/Kr Ion Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Dan Glassburn (dan@niteliteproducts.com).)
<p>
We do quite a large amount of regassing of units.  Lately
there has been more activity concerning regassing of "great whites" and
lexel systems to white light.  Many of these system can be regassed, but
some, in particular 8100 and 5100 white light lexel systems usually don't
work very well as a regassed tube.  The reason is as follows.  White light
systems are mostly krypton and lexel in their bid to get customer loyalty
gave two year warranties on these systems.  Lexel did not put a fill system
on these tubes initially.  The tubes would use up the gas and the pressure
would lower.  This condition would cause more metallic vapor from the
discharge components to cycle in the tube, much as is vapor deposition used
today.  This metal deposition would cool in the return and on the windows,
making the tube hard to start, destroying the mode, and reducing the output.
This effectively makes most lexels difficult to regas, unless it has low
hours or light duty on the tube.  Keep this in mind when looking at these to
purchase, thinking that a regas would bring the tube back.  We normally will
evaluate the tube very carefully before we attempt a regas, and will notify
the customer the condition of the tube and if a regas should be attempted.
Nothing worse than having a customer bring a 5 watt argon to convert only to
get a 1 watt, shaky mode white light. :(

<h2>Maximizing Tube Life, Plasma Oscillations</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argmlh0">Tips for Maximizing Ion Laser Tube Life</A></h3>

Unlike the typical small internal mirror HeNe laser tube which can be turned
on and off with few restrictions after sitting on the shelf for years, ion
lasers require a bit of tender loving care to provide thousands of hours of
reliable service.
<p>
Or, at least some of them do.  From my (Sam's) admittedly limited experience,
Cyonics/Uniphase tubes don't seem to care much about sitting on a shelf being
ignored for many months and will be ready to start on a dime.  ALC-60Xs seem
to be more finicky and long periods of non-use may result in hard starting.
<p>
Since ion laser tube current has a very significant impact on tube life (see
the section: <A HREF=laseratr.htm#atrtle0">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Tube
Life</A>), it is always going to be best to operate the laser at the lowest
output power that provides acceptable performance for your application,
especially when running for many hours at a time.  However, this alone isn't
enough to maximize tube life especially if the laser is used infrequently.
<p>
(Note that medium and large-frame water cooled ion lasers must be run within
a range of currents with the minimum being above the that needed to sustain an
stable arc.  They do not like to be run at very low current - tube life may
suffer dramatically.)
<p>
Here are some tips for operating a small air-cooled argon ion laser to maximize
tube life and prevent it from 'dying on the shelf'.  (Much should also apply
to water-cooled ion lasers as well.)

<ul>
<li>Provide plenty of airflow for the laser (but see the note on shutdown,
 below).
<p>
<li>Run the laser at least once every two weeks for at least a half hour.
<p>
<li>Set the current to maximum for starting.  Otherwise you may not always get
 an older tube to start.  You need the higher current to form the cathode spot
 where emission occurs. Every laser maker I knows specs max current for start.
 Also, most power supplies are at the least risk when set for high current as
 the pass-bank is wide open.
<p>
<li>Start the laser in current mode then run it in light feedback mode to
 prevent tube damaging plasma oscillations which might occur despite current
 regulation.  Most power supplies have the light feedback loop engauged to
 stabilize AC response even when operating in current mode.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argmlh1">Plasma Oscillations and Other Instabilities in
 Ion Lasers</A>.
<p>
<li>Starting is the hardest thing on a tube.  The ignite pulse literally blows
 off a little chunk of cathode each time it fires so you don't want to leave it
 sitting there flashing if it wont start, try turning up the current and see
 if it catches.  If it doesn't start, get an Oudin coil and try to start it
 that way. If a tube has sat and sat and doesn't clean up and start easily
 after running it a couple of times over a few days, it's probably time to
 check the tube voltage and see if your at low pressure.  If the voltage across
 an air-cooled tube is well below the recommended range, it's time to replace
 or regas the tube.
<p>
<li>After it's warmed up and you see a stable beam, you can set it for the
 desired output power.  Or, if you are simply doing this to keep it happy,
 drop it to a little above the minimum current where it still lases and let it
 run at least 20 to 30 minutes.  You don't want to put it in standby if it
 hasn't ran for a while since this won't heat it up.  Standby is just barely
 above where the tube winks out unless you have a new tube.  If it had a real
 hard time starting or has sat in a warehouse for months, let it go a couple
 of hours to recondition the tube and the electrolytics in the power supply.
 Then run it at medium current for awhile to ensure cleanup.
<p>
 Large bore lasers that haven't ran for awhile should be ran at the middle of
 their current range.  Too little or too much current rapidly reduces lifetime.
 They are a little different then short air-cooled tubes and really need to
 heat up.  
<p>
<li>Don't run the fan excessively during shutdown.  You don't want to cool it
 off too fast - a minute or two is fine.  Tests on older tubes have shown a
 10 to 20 minute increase in the time it takes an older tube to come up to full
 power if chilled rapidly down to room temperature.  And you also want to
 minimize stress on the glass or ceramic to metal seals on the cathode leads.
</ul>
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrctt2">Hard-to-Start Ar/Kr Ion
Tubes - Outgassing and Keeping Your Laser Healthy</A> which includes more
info on Oudin coils and salvaging that old tube.

<h3><A NAME="argiosd">Idle or Shut Down Completely?</A></h3>

When you're running an air-cooled ion laser at high power (near the
maximum recommended tube current) as in a laser show application, follow the
recommendations above for startup and shutdown.  Between shows, if the laser
can be run at idle (e.g., 6 or 7 A for an ALC-60X), that's better for the tube
than a complete shutdown (with its thermal shock) even if for an hour or more.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).) 
<p>
There will be some crossover point where shutting it down completely will
result in longer life than running at idle (statistically, at least!)
but I don't know where it is. If you look at the MTBF (see the chart in the
section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argeolp">Effects of Optics on Laser
Performance</A>, 6 or 7 A results in many thousands of hours.  Let's call it
"starts per day", each start or shutdown is stressful to the tube in terms of
expansion and contraction of the ceramic to metal seals, and on ALC tubes with
brazed on fins, it has to stress the whole bore.  Each start also literally
blows chunks off the cathode. So when starts per day exceeds a certain number
N, idle is a better deal.  When Total IDLE Time, T, exceeds some Z number of
hours, powering down completely and restarting multiple times, (i.e., 2 to 3
starts a day) is a better deal. But if there is only half an hour between
shows, idling is the preferred thing to do.  Without further data. it's
really a judgement call.  Commercial equipment such as big printers idle
down.  Biological applications idle down.  That photocopier is running at
7 amps to get 23 mW and its spec'd for 5,000 hours.  But when you ramp it
up to 10 A for kick-butt laser show, you're in a whole new ball game.
I don't know when Z enters the game. But if N is large, life is greatly
shortened. Not only the tube lifetime, but the power supply (pass transistor)
failure odds go way up with each start.

<h3><A NAME="argmlh1">Plasma Oscillations and Other Instabilities in Ion
 Lasers</A></h3>

Like other gas discharge devices, the Ar/Kr ion laser tube is susceptible to
a variety of instabilities.  These can occur even with a good current regulated
power supply feeding the laser head.  While in severe cases, there may be
effects visible to the naked eye like chaotic or periodic variations in
beam brightness, test equipment is needed to confirm that lower amplitude
or higher frequency instabilities are NOT present as the Mark-I eyeball has
its limitations.  The likelihood of seeing any of what is discussed below is
fairly small but it is prudent for every ion laser user to be aware of the
possibilities and be on the lookout for errant behavior.
<p>
Should instability or oscillations be present, the result of not doing anything
to deal with them can include excessive high frequency noise in the laser's
output, shortened tube life, and even complete destruction of the tube or
power supply.
<p>
The light control mode (particularly, the AC or noise feedback) present in most
commercial ion laser power supplies will help to minimize those instabilities
which have a frequency within the loop response.  However, these can only go
so far and the design of the laser head itself and the condition of the ion
tube are just as critical.  Even where the average tube current is way below
its maximum specs, the unstable and constantly moving arc, particularly at
the cathode, can result in continuing damage to the tube.
<p>
There appear to be a variety of possible causes for what are collectively
called 'plasma oscillations' in an ion laser and which of them (if any) may be
present depends on a variety of factors:
<ul>
<li>Excessive capacitance in anode circuit resulting in a relaxation oscillator
 sort of behavior.  This is why for HeNe lasers, the ballast resistor should be
 as close as possible to the anode of the tube.  For ion lasers this isn't
 usually possible - but at the high currents used, more capacitance can be
 tolerated.  However, I wonder about the 10 uF or so of effective capacitance
 between the anode and cathode in ALC-60X/Omni-532 and similar laser heads.
<p>
<li>Improper gas pressure.  Too low a pressure will result in a region where
 the discharge will tend to destabilize and wink out.  Depending on the
 particular laser head/power supply combination, this can result in all sorts
 of havoc with pass-banks and sense transformers! :(
<p>
<li>Interaction with power supply control loop.  If the feedback path from the
 light sensor to the power supply pass-bank has too much delay or phase shift,
 one can end up with a oscillator ("poles in the right half plane").  Normally,
 this will be prevented by proper design but if a laser head from Company A is
 connected to a power supply from Company B, anything is possible. :)
<p>
<li>Changes in arc discharge dynamics with tube current.  As the set current is
 varied, the location of the various regions of the discharge change.  This can
 result in the tube presenting a widely varying effective resistance (negative
 or positive) to the power supply.  Running very close to the minimum current
 at which the tube remains lit (e.g., at idle or standby) may be just asking
 for instability, especially with older tubes.
</ul>
<p>
If you have a vacuum pump good down to a Torr (1 mm of Hg) or so, you can
demonstrate some of these forms of plasma oscillation with a homemade glow
discharge.  Set up a long tube which is sealed except for an electrode at
each end and an exhaust port for the pump.  Connect it to a neon sign
transformer or a current limited AC power supply that's well over the voltage
needed to start the tube.  For a tube 60 cm long with a 1 cm bore, 5 kV is
adequate.  Turn on the voltage and pump the tube down slowly.  You'll find a
region or two where the tube tries to stay lit but keeps fluttering in and out
of conduction.  Watch the plasma itself for periodic and chaotic changes in
shape, structure, and appearance.   That's one type of plasma oscillation.
Next, do the same thing with a DC supply and ballast resistor.  Finally, put
small HV capacitor (even a piece of glass with a couple of aluminum foil
plates) directly across the tube and see what happens.  Experiment with the
value of the ballast resistor and capacitor.  All of the effects you will
experience are possible with an ion laser tube.  However, imagine what can
happen where many AMPS are involved rather than the few mA you are using!
<p>
Unlike a neon sign or HeNe laser tube that drops into a stable operating range
with just a ballast resistor, an arc discharge is less forgiving.  Until the
current is damped and actively filtered the arc will wander.  With a discharge
lamp, the electrode geometry or the wall stabilizes it.  However, the ion tube
plasma has multiple places to go in the cathode space - possibly places that
it wasn't designed to go. The arc can also be destabilized by thermal effects.
A simple ballast resistor as with a brute force 'heater' supply may not provide
enough damping and the tube can develop plasma regions that form relaxation
oscillations especially if there is something to resonate in.  In some cases,
the tube can actually chirp at audio rates - and that can be destructive,
especially with large-frame tubes!
<p>
One way to test for plasma oscillations is to monitor the light sense test
point or the output of a high speed photodetector intercepting the laser beam
on an oscilloscope.  Small amplitude (a few percent) wide band noise is to be
expected but large amplitude oscillations would be cause for concern.
<p>
Another even simpler way may be to put an <b>AM</b> radio near the power supply
or laser head.  At the onset of plasma oscillations, it will produce a
continuous PSSSSTTTTTTTTTT sound due to the broadband RF noise.  On some
tubes, particularly high mileage ones, this will occur above a certain tube
current (or output power) using an otherwise stable power supply.
<p>
Consider the following to avoid plasma oscillations and minimize their effects:
<ul>
<li>Always run in light control mode after starting (see the section:
<A HREF=laserarg.htm#argmlh0">Tips for Maximizing Ion Tube Life</A>).
<p>
<li>Make sure the entire light mode feedback loop has adequate bandwidth
 (several 10s of kHz or more) to handle likely oscillation frequencies).
<p>
<li>Minimize capacitance between the anode and cathode of the ion tube.  A
 series inductor may also help but this cannot be put after the igniter.
<p>
<li>Keep the current regulation stiff.  This is equivalent to a higher value
 series (ballast) resistance, and reduces the likelihood of instability.  The
 reason is that with the ion tube's equivalent series resistance being very
 low (an ohm or so) or even negative over certain ranges of current, one needs
 enough external reactance to maintain stability and prevent oscillations.
<p>
 For an unregulated 'heater' supply, this means putting most of the current
 limiting resistance AFTER the main filter (not part of it) and NOT attempting
 to minimize ballast resistor size and dissipation by running at reduced line
 voltage.  But, see the next paragraphs, below.
<p>
<li>Only use a power supply with current and light feedback for extended
 operation if at all possible unless you can confirm positively that your
 heater PSU-tube combination does not exhibit plasma oscillations and that the
 DC filter (capacitors/ballast resistor combination) results in minimal
 current ripple measured directly at the tube.
<p>
 Resistor based PSUs may cause short tube life.  These can produce plasma
 oscillations which cause problems in overheating of the tube.  The excessive
 ripple of a resistor based (unregulated) PSU causes overheating at the anode
 as the plasma shifts back and forth.  I (Steve) can speak from my experience
 and from helping several others that resistor and choke based PSUs may
 greatly shorten tube life taking it down to the 10s of hours in some cases.
<p>
 You really need a light loop to dampen the oscillations, even air cooled PSUs
 wired for current mode still AC couple the light feedback in, regardless of
 where the light/current mode switch is set. 
<p>
 This is even more critical with NEC tubes.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrctt3">Notes on NEC Argon Ion Tubes</A>.
<p>
<li>Don't attempt to run an ion tube if its pressure is outside acceptable
 limits.
<p>
<li>Where it is not known if instability is present, don't push your luck on
 ion tube current - keep it low (though as noted, this is no guarantee).
</ul>
<p>
Depending on your specific setup, power supply and laser head combination, you
may never experience plasma instability - which is just as well.  However, it
is wise to be aware of the possibility and know how to deal with it just in
case!

<h3><A NAME="argmlh1a">Effects of Improper Filament Temperature</A></h3>

The filament/cathode of an ion tube must be within a certain range of
temperatures to achieve maximum tube life - or any tube life at all!
<p>
Note: The filament IS the cathode for ion laser tubes, microwave magnetrons,
and many other power tubes.  However, others like CRTs and small receiving
tubes (if any still exist) use indirectly heated cathodes.
<p>
Too hot and the filament will burn out prematurely like any incandescent lamp
due to evaporation of tungsten (which may also deposit a black film on the
optics).  Some tubes such as the NECs, like a somewhat cooler filament for
other reasons.  Too hot a filament and they can outgass leading to hard
starting (at least).  There may be other reasons to limit filament temperature
as well.
<p>
However, a cold or not hot enough filament in an ion tube is where the most
warnings apply.  Electrons can be released from a cathode structure by pure
thermionic emission or by secondary emission from ion bombardment or a
combination of these.  (The electrodes can be heated by an external current
as with an ion laser tube or by ion bombardment as with a common fluorescent
lamp.)  The goal for long electrode life is to minimize electrode emission by
secondary emission, since this requires high energy ions that will damage the
cathode - possibly resulting in total failure very quickly.
<p>
This isn't a problem for many vacuum tubes as far as I can tell.  In fact,
normal X-ray equipment use the filament temperature to actually control tube
current.  Microwave ovens may cycle the filament and high voltage every 10 or
15 seconds for the duration when cooking at less than full power.  This results
in HV on the tube during warmup.  Other tube type electronic equipment often
applies full voltage to the tube plates long before the filaments/cathodes
have gotten up to temperature.  But in all these cases, the current ramps up
slowly as the surfaces come up to operating temperature and begin to emit
electrons so that must help as well.
<p>
I expect gas filled tubes like those used in ion lasers are a different story
because a glow discharge or arc can be sustained or initiated by a power
supply with enough voltage compliance range possibly even if the cathode is
cold (or at least not at normal operating temperature).  However, the cathode
has a much higher work function (resulting in current flow due to secondary
emission rather than thermionic emission) and thus there will be much greater
power dissipation and other damaging effects.  Starting is especially hard on
these filaments/cathodes at the instant the discharge or arc is initiated,
possibly even at a higher current than in the steady state.  Current flow
begins in a very small spot (resulting in excessive heating) until it has
a chance to spread out over the cathode surface and stabilize where it is
supposed to go.
<p>
There are no doubt many other more complex phenomena going on as well. :)

<h3><A NAME="argmlh2">Compatibility Issues of ALC-60X and NEC Laser Heads and
 Power Supplies</A></h3>

An NEC laser head CANNOT be run with an ALC-60X supply for several reasons
including differences in voltage compliance range and connector pinouts and
signals.
<p>
The NEC uses an 80 to 95 V drop across the tube.  ALC-60X supplies start to
overheat and stress the transistors when the drop gets to around 99 V.  The
PSU then drops out of compliance and oscillates.
<p>
I can speak from experience on the compliance issue, we tried repumping 60X
tubes with krypton, resulting in a tube voltage of 85 to 90 V.  We got the
tube to lase, but the PSU was less then stable because it wants to see 101
to 109 V.  
<p>
NEC and 60X lasers have the same connector on the side of the head and while at
first glance, most of the signals look about the same, there are some key
differences in pinout and power supply characteristics.  NEC tubes tend to
explode when connected to ALC-60X supplies.  I have witnessed that first-hand.
We had to try just once.  :-(  The anode, cathode, and fan pins are compatible
but the control and feedback pins are not and the signals produce vastly
different behavior in the power supply.  The tube lights up and then the
power supply goes bonkers.   You end up replacing $200 worth of parts in the
PSU if it's a classic gold box, or about $85 worth of parts and some blown
board traces if it's an Omni-155. 
<p>
Keep in mind NEC tubes were designed for the 100 volt Japanese line voltage!
<p>
Linear bipolar based supplies are not that difficult to build and can cope
with the NEC's quirks whereas a quasi-switching or switching PSU like what is
used for 60X tubes can't.  Each supply needs to be matched to a head, the
ALC-60X and Omni-532 supplies are interchangeable, but you need to adjust the
low current limit and light feedback pots for each different head.  On Omni
supplies, there are 4 pots that need to be trimmed for each different head
or any time you replace the MOSFETs in the supply.  This is why a lot of people
have trouble with short life when they buy air-cooled lasers.
<p>
See the chapter: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#asctoc">Complete Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power
Supply Schematics</A> for several designs that could be used with either of
these lasers and can be built with readily available parts.

<h3><A NAME="argweta">Powering Ion Laser Tubes that have Wet Anodes</A></h3>

Water-cooled ion tubes where the high voltage portions of the tube are not
isolated from the cooling water need special considerations, especially for
starting.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Argh!!!  I just got a wet anode SP head, i.e., a SP-164/68/71.  How do I hook
it up to my switcher or a Lexel supply or something like that?  Answer: You
probably don't.
<p>
Wet anode tubes have the tube anode at about ground potential or above it
by about 1 megohm measured when the plasma is off with normal tap cooling
water. The anode is cooled by the cooling water in direct contact.  The
starting pulse is injected through the cathode transformer center tap,
meaning that both the igniter and cathode transformer must have high breakdown
ratings.  Injecting a starting pulse from the anode-end generally dumps the
pulse to ground and you won't even see a flash.  I tried both a medical
switcher and a Lexel 95 supply with no luck, using a series anode end
igniter in both cases.  The only supplies I know that will run these are
the Spectra-Physics supply designed for it and the Aurora 40 series
after-market switcher. The SP supplies also double the line voltage, i.e.,
you have 560 volts across the tube to aid in igniting. Oh and yes, a sizable
current is leaked through the tube assembly to the water, preferably from a
designed-in ground wire that is installed at the cooling water input on the
tube at the cathode end (thin red wire).  Otherwise it comes from the anode
block, which it will probably rapidly corrode.
<p>
If you get one of these and it's not starting on a proper power supply, clean
the corrosion off the plastic around the anode block.  If a good meter reads
less than 200K from the block to frame ground, you have a problem. (Thanks to
Dale Harder for that tip.)

<h2>When You Really Want an Ion Laser, Great Deals, and Other Tid-Bits</h2>
<h3><A NAME="argwyr0">Ross's Quest for an Argon Ion Laser</A></h3>

(From: Ross McEwan (G.R.McEwan@hw.ac.uk).)
<p>
It was a real bit of luck. I study physics at Heriot-Watt University and was
walking by the physics department skip (dumpster?) and saw this dirty great
metal box with Coherent Radiation Model CR-5 Ion Laser printed down the side.
<p>
How could I resist.  At this point I knew zero about argon lasers and assumed
it was capable of maybe tens to low hundreds of milliwatts and would make a
nice contrast to the red HeNe's and diodes that everyone thinks are so cool.
Now don't get me wrong, they are cool but blue is even better. :)  So I
dragged it out of the skip and loaded it into the back of my car, drove it
back to the flat (apartment) and opened it up.
<p>
Oh dear. :-(  The cathode end of the tube has shattered and someone has been
raiding the electronics for parts. I asked the department about the head and
this is the story. It worked. Perfectly. As did four other argon and krypton
head they threw out later despite my attempts to get hold of them first. The
tubes break when the heads drop four feet onto metal and concrete. Apparently
the lasers are "too old to use" and "we use solid state now" so they throw
them out . Sorry about the mild rant but it kind of annoys me to see several
perfectly good lasers destroyed just because they bought new ones and they
don't want curious undergrads messing with the old ones.  Grrrrr...
<p>
(It would drive me nuts to think that perfectly good lasers were trashed when
I can think of so many good homes for them!  Probably too many lawyers or
whatever you call them over there! --- Sam)
<p>
They're called solicitors - yet soliciting is a crime.  Go figure :).  I think
the judge is called "My Lord" too.  And they wear funny wigs.  I don't pretend
to understand the legal system......
<p>
Well that is sort of the reason. For a while (10 years or so) now there has
been all sorts of crud flying about worker safety and dangers at work.  Now as
you know a 5W argon and PSU presents a fair few ways to injure yourself and
the uni is VERY strict about safe working with them in the labs. NO-ONE is
allowed in a lab with an operable laser unless they have had an eye test, read
the rules about laser safety and have appropriate eye wear. If you want to
chat to your mate in the laser labs they have to shutter off the beam, leave
the lab, close the door. If there is no-one left in the lab the laser must be
turned off etc.
<p>
So you can imagine their mild horror when I go round asking for help to get
their old lasers running in my flat. They do have a valid point and I agree
that they would get a good roasting if they GAVE me a laser and I fryed myself
but I promised any lasers they were chucking would get anonymised (labels
peeled, ID numbers ground off, etc) and I'd deny everything as it were but
they still insisted on breaking them. Still, I have rescued one and should get
it working so I am happy.
<p>
In defense of the university who are (perhaps rightly) getting a mild roasting
here, when Nigel (mate and laser enthusiast) and I asked the optoelectronics
boss about the chucking out policy he did give us a dead 1W Nd:YAG with parts
missing and said as long as we didn't take it off campus we could fix it up
and tinker with it.  As it is missing Q switch, cavity, PSU and most of the
head electronics it is unlikely to work any time soon.  We may end up
converting it to pulsed operation.  More likely we will let it rot in Nigel's
lab.  He also offered us a tour of one of the laser labs which has argon,
krypton, excimer lasers, and I believe a TEA CO2 laser.  I get the impression
personally he'd have liked to help.
<p>
Anyway, I phoned Coherent UK.  They said "you are not a company so we can't
deal with you".  They wouldn't even send me schematics on a laser that is 30
years old and hasn't been supported for the past 10? 15? years.  So I looked
around the Web and emailed a few companies asking for schematics and/or parts.
Laser Innovations said they had a tube I could have (for free! if I pay
shipping so I don't mind if it isn't up to commercial rebuild standards) so I
am very close to having a complete head.
<p>
I already have a design for the PSU.  It was initially going to be a line
powered switcher with a small linear pass-bank but it turned out it was easier
and cheaper to build a BIG pass-bank (40 - IRF740 power MOSFETs) and water
cool the heat sink.  It's loosely based on the original Coherent design but
missing a few of the more exotic bits (due to price and parts availability).
The Lexel-88 schematics are pretty much identical to those in the Coherent
manual.  I guess there's only so much you can do with a linear design.
<p>
I doubt my design is as good as Lexel's or Coherent's and I doubt it meets CE
standards but it will (slowly) charge the caps, fire the starter and regulate
the current all without melting. :)  Ferrites, chokes and other moderately
exotic parts are very hard to get hold of in UK unless you are a business or
university or lab.
<p>
I will buy PSU parts soon, a major capacitor manufacturer have generously
donated a big filter capacitor so I estimate 200GBP for the rest of the bits
and pieces.
<p>
Side note: I like the magnetic oscillator in the Lexel-88 starter, very
clever.

<h3><A NAME="argwyr1">Deal of the Week?</A></h3>

Well, we all know about the efficiency of ion lasers!  I hope he has a power
substation nearby :).
<p>
(From: Richard and Debora Everett" (everett@oz.net).)
<p>
I just bought two argon medical lasers from a local auction.  One of them is a
Coherent model 900.  It has a manufacture date of 1981, and the little meter
inside says 79 hours.  It is water cooled and rated for 9 watts output.  The
funny thing is, it takes three-phase 208 V at 35 amps!  This thing must really
be inefficient!
<p>
The second laser is much newer with a manufacture date of 1988.  When I got
it home, I was pleasantly surprised to find it has TWO tubes in it, a 10 watt
argon and a 3 watt krypton.  Both of these tubes are water cooled and made
by Spectra-Physics.  The laser itself was made by Cooper Vision and Hewlett
Packard.
<p>
Now I have little (okay, zero) experience with ion lasers, although I have
worked with HeNe and CO2 lasers before.  I am a little concerned about the
integrity of the Cooper Vision/Hewlett Packard laser tubes, because the &#$#
loading dock guy dropped the whole cabinet assembly about 4 to 6 inches from
his pallet jack.  I have looked at the tubes (very cool looking) and see no
visible cracks, although most of the tube seems to be in a metal jacket.  I
am not sure how to tell if either tube survived all of this.
<p>
Anyway, I only paid $200 for all of this, so I guess I will not be out that
much if they don't work.

<h3><A NAME="argwyr2">A Strange Small Argon Ion Tube</A></h3>

 The base of the tube was wide, and the rest was maybe 1 inch or so. A thin
 glass tube was spiraled around the long tube (the strange looking thing on the

 3 wires stuck out from the base. The only thing readable on the label (from my

 Hmmm.. I will pay the company another visit in a month or so to get a larger
 HeNe tube and maybe a diode laser and then I'll take another look at it.  I
 wonder if they would sell the strange tube to me.  At least it would look good
 as a hi-tech glass display :)."

(From Sam):
<p>
Since there aren't that many types of low power gas lasers, it might be a HeNe
but the spiral tube thing is really strange.  Any chance of getting another
look?  Conceivably, it could be a high quality tube designed to have ring
magnets on the outside to focus and stabilize the beam or something.
<p>
Of course, it could be a lot of other things!

"Maybe.. But the spiral tube would be in the way.. And 3 connection wires?

<p>
I may be wrong here, but it sounds like a NEC Type Argon tube, The wide part,
sounds typical of the NEC tubes, and the cathode is normally suspended inside
this "Wide Part" which on my nec is about 4-5" and the "spiral" sounds to me
like it may be the gas return like used on the NEC tubes, which is from the
wide part back toward the anode region. The mirrors are connected on both ends.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
But glass? Argon ion tubes are usually made of materials like beryllium oxide
and tungsten to withstand the intense heat of the discharge.

<blockquote>
"Today, I paid the local laser company a visit again.  Result: One REALLY
 small Siemens HeNe tube (total length 11.6 cm, diameter 2.3 cm, power 0.7
 mW, makes a nice laser pointer) and a large ~10 mW Uniphase tube which I'm
 going to use for a laser show.
<p>
 Most important result (for this letter's purpose at least):
<p>
 The strange unidentified beast is indeed an argon ion tube (I asked them). I
 thought argon tubes had large cooling fins and a lot of metal structure, but
 this one is mostly glass. Now, I just wonder what power it might be. Can't be
 too high since there seems to be no means of cooling (though the spiral tube
 might also be a water jacket). The tube also has a strange vent port in the
 wide section, In all, really strange. :-)"

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
After talking with a Russian on laser chat from one of the few light show
companies in Russia, your glass beast described as the mystery Russian tube is
an LG106.  It is a roughly 2 to 3 watt argon ion laser - water cooled glass
jacket with ceramic core.  For many years, 7250 pyrex glass tubes encasing
either a BeO core or a stack of graphite or tungsten disks were the tube design
of choice.  They all have a water jacket lathed into the tube and all are
masterworks of the glassblowers' art. Many of them are still in service today
and replacement tubes are still made in production quantities of the higher
wattage glass/BeO stick (Spectra-Physics) variety.  Glass/BeO tubes are known
for lower optical noise. The Russian tube is a short Spectra-Physics glass/BeO
clone.

<h3><A NAME="argold0">The Really Strange Carson Dual Tube Ion Laser</A></h3>

Someone sent me the optics and most of their mountings for a Carson dual tube
ion laser - model unknown.  Apparently, the rest of it lost a fight with a MAC
truck wrecking ball (either deliberately to make sure the thing would never
lase again - safety regulations - or in a most unfortunate accident - also
unknown).  So, I don't have details ln the tubes, magnets, or anything else
that was part of the laser head.  For a description of the matching power
supplies as well as additional speculation on the laser itself, see the
section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascold5">The Really Strange Carson PSU</A>.
<p>
However, nearly all the optics survived and are in fairly decent condition
considering the age and lack of any careful storage.  Only the HR1 mirror got
seriously chipped somehow (possibly valiently defending the laser against
attack!) and only the central 2 mm is at all useful.  Whether the soft dielectric
coatings apparently used on all the mirrors are still reflective enough to be
used in another laser, I don't know but most do look pristine.  Note that they
are *soft* coated which means we don't know what is safe for cleaning.  When
I put some 90 percent isopropyl on one, blisters appeared around the edges and
I terminated that experiment as quickly as possible! :(
<p>
Please refer to the <A HREF="carson.gif">Carson Dual Tube Ion Laser - Optical

This is one of those rare lasers (you will see why) where a pair of ion tubes,
possibly argon and krypton but conceivably both argon, are arranged in
series rather than with some sort of optical combiner.  The two tubes were
side-by-side spaced about 7 inches on center with the OC and HR at one end and
a periscope-like enclosure with a pair of 45 degree turning mirrors at the
other.  Thus the cavity is in the shape of a long U with 4 reflecting surfaces
(in addition to some other stuff) inside the resonator.  O-ring joints were
used to seal everything within the resonator in a gas-tight environment to
prevent contamination of the optics (of course, most of this doesn't exist
anymore either).
<p>
The optical arrangement is: LS, OC, Tube 1, TM1, TM2, Tube 2, MF, HR1 XOR
(LSP, HR2) where:
<ul>
<li>LS - Light sensor.  A 45 degree glass reflector sends a small percentage
 of the output beam to a photodiode detector via a diffuser.  There is a pot
 on this unit - presumably a light level control.
<p>
<li>OC = Output Coupler.  A 25 mm diameter dielectric mirror likely coated for
 470 nm to 520 nm.  No way to disassemble or read any markings.
</ul>
The components comprising the OC assembly (LS and OC) are mounted on a small
three screw (equilateral - equally spaced around a 1-3/4" circle) adjuster
which is in turn mounted on a large kinematic (X-Y) three screw mount (4"
X to C and Y to C, C=Common point).  All screws are 80 tpi.  The large mounts
looks like there were knobs on the X and Y screws - all the others except as
noted are screwdriver adjustments.

<ul>
<li>Tube 1 and Tube 2 were water cooled and operated on separate three-phase
 power supplies but not much more is known about them as everything between
 the optics mounts apparently looked more like a pretzel than a laser. :(
<p>
<li>TM1 and TM2 are the turning mirrors.  Each one is planar and HR coated
 for 450 nm to 520 nm reflectivity at a 45 degree angle.  They are 25 mm in
 diameter about 15 mm thick.  (Determined from hand printing on side of optic.)
</ul>
The following 4 items are part of the HR assembly:
<ul>
<li>MF = Mode Filter, a.k.a., etalon to select longitudinal modes.  This one is
 really strange.  It is about 35 mm long by 15 mm diameter and consists of 3
 pieces cemented together: A thick optical flat on either end separated by a 20
 mm long glass cylinder.  The center part of the cylinder, about 7 mm diameter
 appears to be empty.  The outer surfaces have the best AR coating I have ever
 seen - they just about disappear if not viewed at a very oblique angle.  The
 inner surfaces are broadband coated to perhaps a couple percent (silvery color)
 So, in effect, there is a Fabry-Perot cavity of about 20 mm in length.
<p>
 It is mounted in an aluminum tube which screws into yet another adjustable
 mount.  A knob sticks out the back of the entire HR optics assembly (more on
 this later) and adjusts the tilt angle of the mode filter (one of the three
 screws - the others are not accessible).
</ul>
Following the mode filter, there is an optical diverter that can be flipped
into position.  When out of the optical path, HR1 completes the resonator;
when inserted, a prism reflector diverts the path up to HR2.  At first, I
didn't think there were enough adjustments for actual lasing using HR2 when in
this position and assumed the diverter was for some mysterious purpose like
providing a way of feeding in the beam of an external alignment laser.
However, I am now convinced that this is part of a wavelength tuning assembly
for running the laser in single-line mode.  The alignment adjustments would
have to be made first for single-line lasing with HR2 (by setting the position
of the overall mount - see below).  Then the diverter would be flipped out of
the optical path and final adjustments in all-lines mode could be made using
only the screws on the mount for HR1 itself.
<ul>
<li>HR1 = Main High Reflector.  This optic is about 12 mm in diameter and
 concave with a focal length of 10 meters.  It is also coated for 450 nm to
 520 nm.  When using HR1, the laser must operate on all-lines within this
 range (which includes the 488 nm and 514 nm as well as at least 7 others for
 argon and at least 4 lines for krypton).
<p>
<li>LSP = Line Selecting Prism.  This is a small Brewster prism used to
 deflect the optical path (using refraction at its entrance and exit surface)
 at about a 45 degree angle toward one side to HR2.  An example is shown in
 <A HREF="brwprsm1.jpg">Wavelength Tuning Assembly using Brewster Prism</A>
 (though this is not from the Carson laser.)  A Brewster prism is shaped such
 that the light enters and leaves at very close to its Brewster angle over the
 wavelength range of interest.  This virtually eliminates losses for the
 polarized beam passing through the prism and enables it to be used inside
 the laser cavity.   However, the deflection angle does change very slightly
 with wavelength allowing it to be used for wavelength selection by adjusting
 the orientation of the LSP with a micrometer knob.
<p>
<li>HR2 - Diverter High Reflector.  This is similar to HR1 except its focal
 length is 15 meters.
</ul>
The angle of the diverter assembly can be adjusted with a calibrated 10 turn
knob affair like those on 10 turn pots.  So, assuming the laser operates in
all-lines mode with the fixed HR1 and in single-line mode using HR2, the 10
turn control would provide the selection, and the preset for each wavelength
(up to 13 or more lines depending on the combination of Ar/Kr ion tubes used)
could be restored from a table of knob settings.
<p>
All of the components comprising the HR assembly (MF, HR1, LSP, HR2) are also
mounted on a small three screw equilateral adjuster which is in turn mounted
on a large kinematic mount.
<p>
With so many precision adjustments, I don't envy the person assigned to align
one of these - it must have been a full-time job.  Perhaps, they shipped one
(a technician or engineer, that is) with each laser! :)
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I'll have to concede that it looks like you have a dual tube Ar/Kr pair with
the extremely rare 4 mirror cavity, which meant the required level of cleaning
on the optics went up about 16 fold, and the coating quality control must have
been state of the art for its day. They must of had to ram a extra amount of
power down each tube to overcome the losses.  Alignment is best described
using the word "bitch" and relied on a surveyors' transit or autocollimator.
I'd like to see the manual for THAT one!
<p>
The only thing ever intracavity on an argon is an etalon, Brewster windowed
cell, Pellein-Broca, or Littrow prism.  More commonly, there is an external
combiner/splitter. Any thing else, especially something with multiple coatings
is a external optic because of loss and interference effects.  Pellein-Brocas
are unique because they have two faces at the Brewster angle in a cavity. 
<p>
However, the description above does sound like a mode filter internal to the
cavity on a braodband laser. This thing is bizarre. The only reason I can think
of is to stabilize it for having all those Brewster windows in the path, but an
etalon is a 25 to 50% loss in power, and would have X and Y adjusts on it,
anything intracavity must have X and Y - alignment is more then critical. 
<p>
Was there a heater around it or a Z-axis adjustment stressing the spacer?
If not, it's really weird, as etalons are usually are adjusted by heating the
spacer to get the desired mode, if the flats aren't on piezos
<p>
Stick a HeNe laser beam into it and see if you can get fringes, may be hard to
align to the HeNe. 
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
No heater or other fancy gadgetry (beyond what had been described!).  Shining
the beam from a HeNe laser through the etalon produces significant interference
effects as one approachs normal incidence with wide fluctuations in transmitted
beam power (brightness) as the multiple reflected dots (resulting from light
bouncing back and forth between the two inner surfaces) approach perfect
alignment.

<h3><A NAME="argold1">The Lexel-95/Dye Laser Hybrid</A></h3>

Some photos of the Lexel-95 ion laser can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.70 or
higher) in the "Lexel Argon Ion Lasers" wing.
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
So you ask, what's that huge pile of tan painted junk in Steve's garage, with
the array of heaters around it and the low temp alarm?  Could it be, no, oh
my, it IS an 8 to 12 watt three phase big monster argon ion laser with a 19"
rack power supply and oh, gee goshes ghondi, it's a liquid cancer box,
a.k.a. a dye laser.  Beam me up Scottie. :)
<p>
I Just bought a Lexel Aurora with some help from my partner, same identical
PSU design as the other Lexels (e.g., Lexel-88, just add 10 more transistors,
and don't even bother to beef up the driver stage or change resistor values.
Do add a cap and a blocking diode, with the cap driven by a voltage doubler to
kick up the start voltage across the tube.  After starting, a relay drops the
cap out of the circuit.  The control power comes from a 30 V tap on the three
phase buck/boost instead of a zener string but the control cards are the same.
<p>
It has a lexel 295 tube with a dye head built into the same rails.  It had 200
hours on the meter which is when something caused the concave mirror that
focuses the argon beam onto the dye to explode. It's about 7 feet long and was
mounted on a 800 pound steel table with a 300 pound optional 440 to 220 step
down transformer built into the table. It has a real fancy system of 2 robot
arms and two fixed arms that can punch mirrors into the argon beam and route
it under the dye head to focus it exactly on the same place on the fiber feed
as the dye output - no easy task - which is why the computer that controls it
can fine trim the mirrors with stepper motors.  This was roughly $100,000 when
new, supposedly used to treat kidney disease.  The argon output was up to 8
watts or so with the dye laser producing up to 1.5 W half limited by the
control circuitry.  The wavelength of the dye is unknown but the warning
placard urges nurses to check the dye wavelength before surgery with a
spectroscope.  (The hospital kept the nice hand held unit used for the job.)
<p>
The dye laser portion of this beast has a three mirror ring cavity with a
single plate birefringent tuner.  The dye jet is 2 parallel quartz plates with
a thin gap between them mounted at the Bbewster angle to the dye beam path.
The dye was fed at something like 50 psi and leaps across horizontally into the
top of what looks like a coffee can about 4" across with a funnel at the
bottom and then returns to the dye reservoir via a 1" hose.  Total capacity is
about liter of dye.  The dye passes through a heat exchanger with the warm
laser PSU exit water, then into a filter, into a pump into some kind of
constant pressure gadget, then into the tubing to the jet.  The dye simply
swirls around down the can walls being directed to graze the "can" edge.  The
dye pump assembly is 19" rack about 14 inches tall, it fit into the 800 pound
table on wheels below the PSU.
<p>
Rhodamine 6G Perchlorate (590.1 nm) in DCM solvent, whatever the heck that is,
smells weakly of cherry Coolaid, looks like orange Coolaid, but I sure as heck
wont drink it!
<p>
The 295 tube and magnet is the same diameter as the assembly in a Lexel-75 or
88 head but the arc length is about 18 inches versus maybe 13" for the 88, and
15" for the 95 series.  This thing is supposed to do 12 watts multimode (all
lines) when new.  The length between mirrors is 28" plus another 26" of
resonator rods to hold the dye head and the fiber feed and power samplers. A
ND filter and a 50/50 mirror pop down to attenuate the main beam down for
aiming.  The power samplers are pelicle beamsplitters at the Brewster angle
with silicon cells and white ceramic disks for lambertian diffusers, and
layers of thin blue and red mylar for trimming the cells output.
<p>
The brain is a stand alone 8080 based system on its own little cart with a
power meter sensor that you stick the fiber into. with printer that prints out
treatment times and power levels , then probably totals the bill as well.
<p>
GPIB, RS232 and ethernet optional but not installed on the dye pump.  Separate
sensors for dye power, argon power and power to the fiber feed.  The fiber is
400 micron glass (core size unknown).  The birefringent disk just looks like a
chunk of microscope slide cover Epoxied into a rotary stage with a micrometer.
It's spun about its Z axis like a record on a record player. There are no
visible special effects when you look through it, save for a thin rainbow at
one angle if your looking at a bright point source. at 55 degrees it looks
clear.
<p>
In order to make the dye laser compact enough to fit in the rails, they sawed
off parts of the dye cavity optics prior to coating to make room for the beams
to pass by. So they all look like half moons or circles with flat spots.
<p>
If it weren't for the $1,800 custom argon focus mirror being blown to shreds,
I would have fired up the dye. All optics in the dye head are close together
and have visible concave radiuses, looks like a funhouse mirror when you look
into them.  It's a twisted ring, roughly horizontal, with a flat OC. two of the
mirrors in the ring are only a few CM apart, then the OC is about 12 cm away.
The biref tuner is in the long path, away from the jet.
<p>
Dye is terribly corrosive to hardware in the system, and forms a sticky
residue like superglue and causes contact rust on iron and severe corrosion on
aluminum.

<h3><A NAME="argold2">The Spectra-Physics-161 Laser - More or Less</A></h3>

Well, actually, what you might get as a pull from a graphics arts machine. :)
<p>
Some photos of the SP-161/162 lasers, the SP mating power supply, and the NEC
clone laser head can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.11 or
higher) in the ""Spectra-Physics Ion Lasers" wing.
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).) 
<p>
Ah, an OEM SP-161 out of a Times Graphics, Inc. printer. Probably just like
all the others that have been dumped on the market lately: An SP head with a
National Laser replacement tube resold by a American Laser and connected to an
NEC power supply.  Gotta love competitors making interchangeable parts to try
to steal each others' sales.  The good news is most of them have had a long
life sealed mirror 15 mW tube installed, made by National Laser. With a typical
reading of 69,000 hours on the running time meter, it's actually on tube #6, 7,
or 8. National Lasers tubes go for 8,000 hours or more in life tests at rated
power, but typically laser 12,000 hours according to the test data they sent
to me. 
<p>
It is quite normal for these lasers to not need a side cover for directed
airflow, unlike the American or omni units that need careful airflow controls.
That plastic fan mount and a 300 to 450 cfm fan is all you need. The air must
blow out the  top of the laser.  In other words, air enters the fins at the
bottom of the laser and exits out where the top would be.
<p>
I don't know how much you paid for the unit, but considering most laser PSUs
cost about $800 to $900 used.  In some ways that unit was/is the best PSU ever
produced for air cooled lasers so even if you just end up reselling it, there
is likely money to be made.
<p>
National Laser might sell you a "shipping" cover if you need it, SP will not
sell you a cover even though they have them in stock (too many lawyers).  But,
all you really need is some sheet metal bent on a brake by a tin shop.  This
is for safety, to prevent contact with the lethal voltages inside.  It needs
some side holes of at least 6 square inches per side for airflow.
<p>
If you have the standard SP supply, you will not need a remote.  Just make
sure the switch on the front panel is in "local" control. 
<p>
SP gets $58 for a manual.  The NEC-3050 manual will be nearly as good since
that is pretty much an exact clone.  The light meter calibration won't be
worth a damn, odds are it's still calibrated for tube #1!
<p>
Go to <A HREF="http://www.nationallaser.com">National Laser</A> and see
if your tube looks like a 61I series, or if you have a glass tube.  I have the
tube identification.  National's tubes want to see 4 amps minimum and 8 amps
absolute maximum current, typically running best at only 6 amps.
<p>
(From: David Hansen (gldhansen@rcn.com).)
<p>
I just bought an interesting hybrid argon laser system. The tube is made by
<A HREF="http://www.nationallaser.com/">National Laser</A>, the head is a
<A HREF="http://www.splasers.com/">Spectra-Physics</A> (now Newport)
model 161B, and the
the power supply is an NEC unit.  The laser was a pull from a high-speed
scanner, so it is missing the head cover and fan.  I am in the process of
getting these.  The output power should be about 20 mW (multiline) when the
darn thing is actually running. :(
<p>
Thanks to Steve Roberts for helping me get the components needed to finish
this project.
<p>
The NEC power supply has a 15 pin "Jones" style connector for the mating cable
to the SP-161 laser head and a 37 pin circular AMP connector for remote
operation (there is also a local mode that ignores the signals on this
connector).  On the PSU front panel there is a dual-range meter (tube current
and laser output power), a current/light selector switch, a main power switch,
an "Emission" switch, and an interlock connector for the printer cover (this
has to be bypassed for the laser to run). The back panel has the laser head
connector jack, three fuses, and a power control pot. The power cord is on the
front panel. The two main annoyances about the PSU are the location of the
power control pot and the fact that it weighs 40 pounds!

<h3><A NAME="argold3">Spectra-Physics-2010 Laser Head</A></h3>

Some photos of the SP-2010 laser head can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.71 or
higher) in the "Spectra-Physics Ion Lasers" wing.
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
The magnet is the long metal cylinder
around the tube.  It has at least 5,000 feet of magnet wire wound along the
long axis of the tube. Usually SP paints their magnet assemblies black. Yes,
it's a electromagnet - only a few lasers were ever made with conventional
magnets. Cooling water flows between the electromagnet wall and the tube
outer wall.  Magnet current is quite small, on the order of 1 to 10 A.
Usually the magnet is wired across the filter caps of the PSU, although
many lasers have magnet regulators. SP tends to regulate their magnet
current.  The magnet will be between 15 and 250 ohms, depending on
the laser design. You should have the following, 2 magnet leads, at least 2
leads to the hot cathode, one wire from the anode. Often times wires are
doubled up or used in pairs to increase current capacity while keeping
flexibility.  Usually cathode leads are paired up, i.e., two reds, two blues.
The cathode leads will read as almost a short circuit until the cathode
heats (cathodes need between 2 and 3.5 volts at 20 to 40 amps, and each
different tube has a critical cathode voltage that cannot be exceeded.)
Then the cathode is about .5 to 3 ohms when hot.

<h3><A NAME="argold4">Albion Instruments Anesthesia Analyzer</A></h3>

Here is an example of the use of an argon ion laser tube in an application
taking advantage of the possible very high intracavity photon flux when 2
HR mirrors are used instead of an HR and an OC to to produce an output beam.
For a laser of this type, the intracavity flux could be 10s or even 100s of
<b>WATTs</b>.  The air-cooled 60X style tube, resonator, optics, and sensor
box are shown in <A HREF="aiaa1.jpg">Albion Instruments Anesthesia Analyzer
Argon Ion Laser Head</A> and a closeup of the line selector in
<A HREF="brwprsm1.jpg">Wavelength Tuning Assembly using Brewster Prism</A>.
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The Albion Instruments anesthesia analyzer has 8 PMTs (PhotoMultiplier Tubes)
viewing the photon flux in an intracavity cell via interference filters. The
intracavity cell is made of metal with its own high quality Brewster
windows.  Argon gas flowed through the cell with a trace of the patients
"exhaust",  It looks at N2O, CO2, O2, and the anesthesia agent.  It has high
reflectors at both ends.  I have the cavity from one setting here.  We put
the tube in my friends 60X head.  It's a 150 mW tube with the best Brewster
stems I have ever seen on a air-cooled laser - really high grade optically
contacted fused silica windows instead of the normal $20 natural silica ones
with frit or Epoxy seals.  Search for Albion's patents on one of the patent
servers.  I scrapped one out for a friend.  It had a modified Omnichrome 150
power supply with a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) board built onto the 37
pin connector for setting power level.  A Dayton 3C44 fan was used for cooling
and it has an extended cast aluminum resonator with no rods, plus an
intracavity Brewster prism for wavelength selection. A photodiode monitored
the leakage from an end mirror for optical power regulation.  The whole thing
was automated and on wheels.

<h3><A NAME="argpodl">Power-On-Demand Medical Laser Conversion?</A></h3>

Many, if not all, modern ophthalmic and other medical ion lasers use what's
called "Power-On-Demand" (POD) power supplies.  Rather than run the tube as
long as the laser is on like most scientific and entertainment lasers, it
actually turns the tube on only when the beam is actually needed.  By carefully
controlling operating conditions during the initial starting period, this
can be implemented such that tube will last millions of shots without
serious degradation.  POD technology allows for
much reduced power dissipation and cooling requirements under most conditions
of clinical use.  However, this means that many components in the power
and cooling system will be grossly undersized for CW use.
So, what about finding one of these in the dumpster
and converting it to a laser show laser?  Various Coherent models show
up on eBay for next to nothing (as these things go).
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The Coherent Ultima 2000 is a true Power-On-Deman laser. It charges
400,000 uF of capacitors in its base and has a high frequency inverter
that builds up the 220 VDC to about 500 VDC.
<p>
The tube is cooled but the magnet is not, and the magnet is only good for a
few minutes before it burns up.  We tried one.  The tube will run
on a Lexel-88 power supply.  It's small, but you have to let it run a minute,
cool for 5 minutes.  The tube has sealed mirrors on bellows
and uses a Novus Omni type tube core, which is basically a shortened I60.
Even the cathode is duty cycled on that one.
<p>
Power-On-Demand lasers are NOT generally CW CAPABLE.  These include the
Coherent Ultima 2000, Novus 2000, Novus Omni; HGM PC, PC-EDO, Surgica K1,
Surgica K5, and all HGM yellow-green krypton lasers.
<p>
Low duty cycle laser may be modded to CW at lower powers.  These include
HGM models 5, 8, and 20.

<h3><A NAME="arghgma">HGM Argon Ion Medical Lasers</A></h3>

<p>
There are some that are unique in that having a tube similar in size
to a ALC-60X but with a much larger bore can generate 3.2 watts for a
second or two at a very low duty cycle.  The computer cranks back the
available exposure times to protect the tube.
<p>
Generally HGM models 5, 8, and 20 have CW tubes. All others are
questionable on running CW.  A 5 is basically an ALC-68 with short
Brewster stems, a model 8 corresponds roughly to an ALC-905/909 and a model
20 is close to an ALC-920.
<p>
Some of the HGM yellow-green and the PC tubes, i.e., Surgica K(x), are
power on demand tubes and are not really capable of running CW.
<p>
It will be necessary to make a cheater cable to bypass the computer.
The PSU will run by itself with the control computer removed entirely.   The
simplist cheater starts the laser PSU and ramps the tube current up to the
upper limit.  Install the custom jumpered 9 pin DIN plug, add an
on/off keylock switch, and then the high current limit
potentiometer on the board becomes your current setting. Getting
variable power is complex because the supply curve is nonlinear.
You then use the upper limit as a control pot, mindful
that strange things happen if you turn it lower then the lower limit
pot and that you can usually easily source enough current from the PSU
to start frying the tube. The HGM PSUs really don't have a current
mode - they are designed for light from the ground up.
The upper and lower limits on the control card are soft limits and can
drift somewhat. Service mode doesn't get you a current mode either!
<p>
The aiming beam knob is actually the lower current limit on HGMs when
in treat mode.  There are quite a few variations on the PSUs.  Unlike most
medical Lasers, HGM's computer is rather deeply integrated into the
PSUs, especially on the pulsed power-on-demand tubes.  They can't run
CW for more then a few seconds.  Some units actually have rather complex
CPU controlled cooling.
<p>
Note that the control computer also runs the displays, and since its
out of the loop, if you try to keep it as a power meter your going to see
ERR on the display. 
<p>
As an example, the HGM-5 will do 3 W pulsed and is rated around 1 W CW for
2 to 3 minutes.  The limiting factor is the size and heating of the
electrolytics in the PSU. They're kind of undersized for CW and there
is no room to boost them in size or add more.
<p>
It's then a 300 to 500 mW CW laser if you boost the cooling. Running at 1 W
will burn off lifetime fast.  My favorite way of increasing airflow is to cut a
pair of 6" holes in the top lid and add a pair of 60X style patriots. Its
a 68B tube with shorter Brewster stems, different ignition, and very very
multimode optics.
<p>
The test for medical service is 3.2 watts at 22 A or less.  
The ones I've set up for friends run at 15 A or
so for a nice trade off between power and life.   My one buddy got his
with 5,000 hours of medical service on it, and we run it at 15 and he
got 550 mW.
<p>
At the back side of the tube there is a  4 pin molex hanging free on
white wires.  light the tube, put in a isolated battery powered
plastic cased voltmeter and the reading times 30 is the tube current.
