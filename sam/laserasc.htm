<h2>Introduction to Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply Schematics</h2>

This chapter provides detailed schematics of a variety of power supplies
suitable for use with the common Ar/Kr ion tubes available to the hobbyist on
the surplus market.  Included are examples of commercial designs (Omnichrome
150R and 532 head, Lexel 88 and head) as well a somewhat simpler but fully
capable system for small air-cooled ion tubes (SG-IL1) that may be constructed
from readily available parts and will be satisfactory for typical experimental
and light show applications, and may be easily modified to handle larger ion
tubes or provide additional features.  There are also a couple of 'bare bones'
designs (SG-IT1 and SG-IX1/SG-IY1) that can be 'thrown together' relatively
quickly and inexpensively and are useful for basic testing of Ar/Kr ion laser
tubes.  Either of these can be converted into a full featured unit at a later
time.  There are also schematics of several other ion laser heads including
those from NEC and Cyonics/Uniphase, as well as interconnect wiring for some
common systems.
<p>
In conjunction with the other chapters on Ar/Kr ion lasers, these sets of
schematics can be useful for understanding the principles of operation of ion
laser power supplies or for repair of a broken unit.  While what are presented
here aren't really complete plans, with a bit of effort, they can be adapted
to a variety of ion laser tubes to provide any degree of performance and
sophistication desired - from basic and simple to full featured with all sorts
of bells and whistles.
<p>
Brief descriptions are also provided of the Lexel-95 PSU, Spectra-Physics 265
exciter with a 165-3 argon head, and a few other systems.  Schematics for
these may be added in the future.
<p>
See the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> for for
multiple detailed photos of several argon/krypton ion lasers and power
supplies.
<p>
Note: For an explanation of the meanings of various designations like DC+,
Boost, Tube-, etc., used in these schematics, see the section:
<A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdnota">Notation used in Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply
Diagrams and Schematics</A>.

<h3><A NAME="ascias0">Ion Laser Power Supply Selection Guide</A></h3>

The chart below lists each of the power supplies described in this chapter
(most with schematics) and the approximate range of ion tube voltages that can
be handled by that design without modification.  In most cases, slightly
higher or lower voltage tubes can be accommodated with minor changes to the
circuit.  Use this chart only as a guide - check the specifications of your
tube(s) before buying or building anything!

<p>
Notes:
<ol>
<li>Links to the schematics and/or interconnect info for most of these power
 supplies may be found in this chapter's
 <A HREF="laserasc.htm#asctoc">Sub-Table of Contents</A>.
<p>
<li>Power Input: The nominal input voltage.  All are line connected
 (non-isolated) except for FS-IT1.  The Omni-150 can be converted to 230 VAC
 operation by component replacement and some rewiring.  The Lexel-88 includes
 a buck-boost transformer and a variety of strapping options to support a
 variety of other input voltages. 
<p>
<li>Regulation Type: N = None, L = Linear, S = Switchmode (PWM).  Regulation
 Mode: C = Current feedback and L = Light feedback.  For power supplies
 without regulation, current control is achieved via the use of a tapped or
 adjustable ballast resistor (heating element!) and/or via control of input
 voltage via a Variac.
<p>
<li>Tube Voltage: Approximate range of tube voltages supported by the power
 supply.  In some cases, an extended range (probably on the low side for
 switchmode regulators and the high side for linear regulators) may be
 possible with adjustments and/or modifications to permit a given power
 supply to support other tubes without blowing up.  Note that the entries
 for the commercial power supplies, above (first grouping), are just wild
 guesses - I would welcome some hard facts if anyone actually has some! :)
<p>
<li>The designs of the home-built ion laser power supplies can be easily
 adapted to almost any small (air-cooled) laser head.  A few of the models
 that are either known to work or expected to work without difficulty include
 the ALC-60X, NEC GLG3030, SP-162A/B/C, and Cyonics/Uniphase 22XX.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="ascvcnv">Voltage Conversion Options</A></h3>

When your power company doesn't provide the voltage that the power supply
of your laser expects, your options are quite limited:

<ul>
<li><b>Linear power supplies:</b> The easiest and best solution is to locate
 a step-down or step-up transformer of adequate power rating.  The tube,
 pass-bank, and line-voltage must be carefully matched for proper operation.
 Changing anything significantly will likely result in either the laser not
 starting or the power supply (and possibly the tube) melting down.
<p>
 Suitable transformers are not terribly expensive to buy new but can also be
 found in salvage yards associated with equipment like photocopiers.
<p>
<li><b>Switchmode power supplies:</b> Models like the Omni-150 can be
 converted between 115 VAC and 230 VAC by some rewiring and possibly other
 minor changes.  (See the sections starting with:
 <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascomcon1">Converting
 the Omni-150 from 115 VAC to 230 VAC Operation</A>.)  This will be true of
 many others as well - consult your user manual.  No user manual? :)  Don't
 attempt any such conversion without specific instructions - a lot of smoke
 would be the most likely outcome.
</ul>

For the special case of running a 230 VAC single-phase ion laser power supply
in the USA, the simplest solution is to use the circuit for your electric
range, dryer, or water heater, or install a separate 230 VAC outlet.  This
will provide 30 to 50 A.
<p>
Running a three-phase power supply on single-phase power entails additional
problems since (as is shown below), much less filter capacitance - if any -
is required using three-phase so the entire front end would have to be
rebuilt to achieve adequate performance.

<h3><A NAME="ascsppn">Specifications and Pinouts for Various Argon Ion
 Lasers</h3>

Companies that sell replcement power supplies often have laser specification
and wiring information on their Web sites.  One I know of is:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.laserdrive.com/argon.cfm?pl=2,0">Laserdrive Argon
 Ion Laser Power Supply Page</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Laser manufacturers may also have connection diagrams for their systems.
One example is:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A> which has the
 remote connector wiring at least.  Search for "ion laser power supply".
</ul>
<p>
One thing that may not be present when acquiring a laser head and
power supply separately is the umbilical cable.  These are very
expensive if purchased new (assuming this is even possible anymore).
However, they do turn up from various surplus places and on eBay,
sometimes at more reasonable prices.  And, if you're handy with a
soldering iron, they can be built for under $50 from readily
available components.  The following applies directly to the
cable having identical round connectors at both ends such as
on the ALC-60X/Omni-532/543 but it should be possible to construct
others as well.  See the specific sections on the interconnect
wiring for these lasers to determine minimum wire sizes for the
high current conductors (filament and anode).
<p>
The connectors and pins for making a cable are AMP parts available
on-line from Digikey.  The cost of making a cable would be about $50.  All
the connections in the umbilical run 1 for 1 straight through, i.e., pin 1
is pin 1 at both ends.
<p>
You need 4 of the big female filament pins at about $7 each and two
end shells at about $6 each and a bag of the smaller pins at about $15.
You'll also need the mating remote connector body, about $6 also.
Here are the part numbers for making the ALC-60X/Omni-532/543/etc.
umbilical cable:
<p>
<b>Shell:</b> AMP type 206613, Series 4 CPC (Circular Plastic Connector)
 Size/contact arrangement  23-22M, standard sex-free hanging plug.
<p>
<b>Pins:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Big ones: AMP #66740-X TYPE XII female (2 each end, X depends on type of
 plating).
<p>
<li>Little ones: AMP #66601-7 or 66360-0 female (20 each end if you fully
 populate the cable).
</ul>
<p>
These can be obtained from the major electronics distributors like Digikey,
Mouser, Allied, etc.
<p>
Regardless of the connector types, if building your own umbilical,
or an extension cable, there are usually only 3 wires that are critical
for current: the filament (usually called F1 and F2) and DC+ (the anode
connection).  To be safe, use two #10 AWG (or one #8 AWG) wire for F1 and
F2, and one #10 AWG wire for DC+.  Yes, #10.  It's not only a matter of
safety as would be the case in house wiring, it's the voltage drop.
F1 and F2 have 20 to 30 A on them for the filament current
as well as the return current from DC+ (up to 10 A or more).  And the voltage
across the filament is only 3 VAC.
<p>
Everything else is usually low current, so #22 AWG wire should be fine
(but fatter won't hurt).  Use twisted pairs for light feedback
or other low level control signals (twisted with signal ground).

<li>Omnichrome 150R power supply and 532 laser head.  This is functionally
  identical to and plug compatible with the American Laser Corporation 60X.
  (However, the original ALC power supplies are totally different
  electrically.)  The ALC-60X/Omni-532 are the most common argon ion laser
  systems available on the surplus market.  The power supply uses a switchmode
  regulator.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion
  Lasers</A> for more information on the basic characteristics of this laser
  (and some photos) of these systems.  (The Omni-150P is virtually identical
  to the Omni-150R and the MWK Laser Products model MWK-APS appears to be a
  slightly simplified clone of the Omni-150 designs.)
<p>
<li>NEC GLG3030 laser head.  This is another item that shows up on the
  surplus market.  It uses an ion tube with internal mirrors but still has
  external mirror adjustments for fine tuning.  While not directly compatible
  with the ALC/Omni power supplies, it can be adapted without too much trouble.
<p>
<li>Lexel-88 power supply and laser head.  Various versions of the Lexel-88
  have been produced since the 1970s.  After the ALC-60X/Omni-532, the Lexels
  are the most common ion laser.  The particular power supply included here
  uses a massive linear regulator running off of a 230 VAC front-end with very
  simple current and light control feedback loops.  Therefore, modifications
  to adapt the basic design to your more modest needs should be quite
  straightforward.
</ul>
The basic approaches used in the Omnichrome and Lexel designs are similar to
those of a large number of other commercial ion laser power supplies though
obviously, details may vary quite a bit.  Portions of the SG-IL1 and SG-IY1
presented later in this chapter are based to varying degrees on modifications
to these commercial power supply designs.
<p>
There are also various types of information on other ion lasers systems that
aren't nearly as complete but should be useful when attempting to get a laser
operational or to repair one without complete manuals or documentation.
This includes some laser head diagrams and interconnect wiring descriptions
for several systems.  Also see the section:

<h3>Omnichrome 150R Power Supply and 532 Laser Head (Omni-150R/532)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascom10">Introduction to Omni-150R/532 Schematics</A></h4>

Note: The following sections apply to the Omni-150R and the mostly similar
Omni-150P.  However, the earlier Omni-150 differs internally and is
covered starting in the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom2">Omnichrome 150
Power Supply (Omni-150)</A>.  However, the newer versions of these lasers
(and the larger 543/643) are now manufactured by Melles Griot and
come with quite different power supplies.  Information on their user
interface at least may be found at
<A HREF="http://lasers.mellesgriot.com/specsheet.asp?CatID=1115&P=BTO">Melles
Griot 175B/176B Ion Laser Power Supplies Specifications</A>.  (Or, go
to <A HREF="http://lasers.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot Lasers</A>,
"Air-Cooled Ion", "Ion Laser Power Supplies - Build To Order/OEM".)
<p>
The Omnichrome 532 and American Laser Corporation 60X are functionally very
similar (possibly identical for some versions).  With the ALC-60X/Omni-532
being the most common argon ion lasers available surplus to the hobbyist,
experimenter, or budding light show enthusiast, having a detailed schematic
is a definite plus (what an understatement, huh?!).  These circuit diagrams
can also serve as the basis for a simple switchmode power supply design of
your own!  The Omni-150R can drive a variety of small Ar/Kr ion tubes
requiring up to 10 A or so continuous current at 95 to 110 VDC - which covers
most of the types of air-cooled tubes you are most likely to acquire.  This
would include the ALC-60X/Omni-532, Cyonics/Uniphase 2214 series, and many
Spectra-Physics models.  I expect that it can also power the NEC GLG3030 and
other tubes requiring as little as 80 VDC (possibly limited to slightly less
maximum current) but have no hard information on reliability when operating
under these conditions.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascomlow">Running Ion Tubes with Lower DC Voltage
Ratings on the Omni-150</A>.
<p>
The Omni-150P is another version of this power supply with essentially the
same specifications.  It has a different PCB layout and there were a few
modifications including the use of a commercial current sense transformer
instead of the custom one used on the Omni-150R but it is nearly identical
electrically.  And, the MWK Laser Products model MWK-APS appears to be a
virtual clone of the Omni-150 designs with only some minor simplifications
(like the elimination of multiple taps on the filament transformer).  Even most
of the part numbers are identical.  (I know that a complete schematics/parts
list/PCB layout package for MWK-APS is available from
<A HREF="http://www.mwklasers.com/">MWK Laser Products</A> but I don't know if
they offer an assembled version.)  Therefore, the Omni-150R schematics and
descriptions that follow should be quite useful in troubleshooting either of
these units.
<p>
The <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> has detailed
views of various argon/krypton ion lasers including examples of the very
popular 60 series from American Laser Corporation.  However, note that the ALC
and Omni models are plug compatible, the ALC power supply is NOT electrically
or physically the same as the Omni-150R described below.

<h4><A NAME="ascom11">Omni-150R/532 Schematics</A></h4>

The schematics have been redrawn from poor originals of the Omnichrome 150R
power supply and Omnichrome 532 laser head.  The only things that are missing
are wiring for the interconnect and remote cables, and some of the panel
switches and indicators.
<p>
The diagrams are available in PDF format.  There are three (3) separate sheets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="150rpsch.pdf">OMNI-150R-PWR</A> -
 Omni-150R Power Subsystem.  This includes the AC line front-end,
 switchmode regulator, Hall-effect current sense circuitry, filament supply,
 low voltage supply, and igniter boost multiplier.
<p>
<li><A HREF="150rcsch.pdf">OMNI-150R-CTL</A> -

<p>
<li><A HREF="532hsch.pdf">OMNI-532-HEAD</A> -
 Omni-532 Laser Head.  This includes the air-cooled argon ion

</ul>
<p>
Due to some inconsistencies between the '150R' and '532' schematics that I
used, some signal names and/or connectors identification may not match.  I
have attempted to correct these discrepancies where possible.  However, this
may have resulted in using names that were different than the 'official' ones
in some cases.
<p>
Note that ALC's own power supplies are entirely different electrically from
those from Omni.  Only the heads and electrical interfaces are identical as
per Xerox standards.  Thus, these schematics (150/155) do not at all apply to
an similar American product.  Newer supplies have RS232 controls options and
are power factor corrected.
<p>
The basic operation of the each of the major functional blocks are summarized
below.  For a more detailed discussion of the operation of the individual
circuits, see the chapter: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A>.

<h4><A NAME="ascom12">Omni-150R Power Subsystem</A></h4>

The <A HREF="150rpsch.gif">Omni-150R - Power Subsystem</A> consists of of the
(110 V) AC line front-end/rectifier/filter and switchmode (buck) regulator,
current sense, filament supply, and boost multiplier, and low voltage supply.
<p>
<ul>
<li>S1 is MAIN POWER and is a DPST switch.  There are also a line filter and
 fuses in the primary circuit, not shown).
<p>
<li>Rectifier/Filter - The switchmode design of the 150R isn't as demanding in
 terms of ripple as a linear type and therefore the AC line front-end can be
 quite simple consisting only of the bridge rectifier (D1, 35 A, 600 V) and
 main filter capacitors, (C11-C13, 4,500 uF total).  This should result in
 a ripple of less than 20 V at full load (10 A).
<p>
<li>RLY2 is the Preheat relay.  It is activated by the Preheat Timer to bring
 the Ar/Kr ion tube filament up to the proper temperature.  It also slowly
 precharges the main filter capacitors, C11 to C13, through D9 and R30.  This
 eliminates serious inrush current when RLY1 enables power to the main
 bridge.
<p>
<li>RLY1 is the Operate relay.  It is activated after the required filament
 preheat delay of 35 seconds.
<p>
 RLY1 also enables the power supply fan and the igniter circuitry.  (The fan
 in the laser head runs as long as SW2 is in the ON position.)
<p>
<li>R24 is a safety bleeder resistor to discharge C11-C13 in a relatively short
 time once power is removed.  The value of 24K results in a time constant of
 a bit less than 2 minutes - which isn't *that* short.  Use a discharge tool
 like a 40 W light bulb with well insulated probes if you are impatient!
</ul>
<p>
WARNING: For these line connected designs with a bridge rectifier, NO part of
the circuit can be tied to earth ground (as is possible with a HeNe supply)
for safety.  Therefore, troubleshooting must be done with extreme care
especially if no isolation transformer is used.  Connecting the ground lead of
a properly grounded scope to any part of the circuit will result in smoke or
worse!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Chopper - This consists of a pair of power MOSFETs (Q8 and Q9) controlled
 through the isolated drive transformer (T2), the snubber, and freewheeling
 diode.  The components in the gate circuit assure proper signal levels and
 provide protection for the MOSFETs.  I've heard that some instances of this
 supply have had the MOSFETs measured Vds(on) at max current closely matched
 to equalize the power dissipation but I don't know if this is done in
 general.  The series RC network (R8, C27) limits the peak voltage across
 the MOSFETs upon turn-off and the freewheeling diode (D20) conducts during
 the part of the cycle when the MOSFETs are off maintaining current flow
 through the series inductors (L1 and L3).  For a more detailed explanation
 of how this circuit operates, see the info at the end of this section.
<p>
<li>Regulator filter components - L1, L2, C35, and C23, implement an L-C-L-C
 filter.  Since the switching frequency is high - around 200 kHz - these
 are of only modest size for the (10 A) current requirements.  (L2 is part of
 the Hall-effect current sense circuitry and does not contribute to the
 filtering).
<p>
<li>Current sense - The op-amp (IC2D) generates CS signal of 0.1 A/V by
 balancing the current in the 1,000 turn winding of L2 against the full tube
 current passing through a 1 turn winding on the same core.  HS1, the
 Hall-effect device placed in a gap in the core, produces an error voltage
 proportional to magnetic flux passing through it.  A buffered version of CS,
 BCS, is also produced.
<p>
<li>Boost multiplier - A voltage quadrupler powered when RLY1 closes (operate)
 generates 400 to 500 VDC for use by the igniter in the laser head.  Its
 output is effectively shorted out (disabled) once the tube starts.
<p>
<li>Filament supply - A multitap low voltage high current power transformer IS
 the filament power supply.  The filament tap switch must be set for the
 particular line voltage and tube in use based on precise measurements.
 Proper filament temperature is critical to reliable operation and long tube
 life.
<p>    
<li>Low voltage power supply - This uses a small centertapped power transformer
 and 7815/7915 IC regulators.
</ul>
<p>
WARNING: ALL the power and some of the associated control circuitry is
line-connected.
<p>
(From: Darren Freeman (daz111@rsphy1.anu.edu.au).)
<p>
The MOSFETS switch from DC+ to DC- (the full voltage across the main filter
capacitor bank), so the voltage of the load is irrelevant.  Whenever the
freewheeling diode (D20 on the schematic) is conducting, the MOSFETs see the
input voltage. And the average current through the MOSFETs isn't the same if
the input voltage isn't the same.  The *peak* current is equal to the load
current, which will be the same.  But the reduced duty results in the average
current being lower, which is equal to the supply current. I expect that the
tube voltage isn't a big deal to the PSU - the 240 V version can probably
handle much higher tube voltages, maybe 250 V DC, with still the same current
rating as before. But I haven't tried this as the control loop could still
freak out.
<p>
In more detail: While the MOSFETs are on, the inductor (the sum of L1 and L3)
sees the raw supply voltage (Vin) - Vload and the current ramps up a little
bit, then the MOSFETs turn off and the current has to keep flowing (because
of the series inductor which hates current changes) so the freewheeling diode
(D20) conducts (and the MOSFETs see the full supply voltage).  Now the
inductor sees -Vload and the current ramps down a little.  Then the cycle
repeats.  The effective voltage is roughly the duty-cycle times Vin, and with
an inductor and capacitor that's roughly what you get out.  The average
current into the MOSFETs is the duty-cycle times Iout. It's like a transformer
for DC, quite efficient.  The MOSFET heating is due to resistive losses in the
MOSFETs and also largely due to the transients during switching where the
MOSFETs see current and voltage at the same time.  As the frequency goes up,
the switching losses start to dominate, but if you get better MOSFETs you can
afford higher frequencies and smaller inductor/capacitor filters.

<h4><A NAME="ascom13">Omni-150R Control Subsystem</A></h4>

The <A HREF="150rcsch.gif">Omni-150R - Control Subsystem</A> consists of of
the Preheat Timer, PWM Controller and MOSFET driver, primary (inner) loop,
and secondary loops for Standby, Current Feedback, and Light Feedback.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Preheat timer and interlocks - A CD4040 12 bit counter is used as the
 preheat timer.  A 60 Hz signal from the low voltage power supply is the
 master clock.  The timer is enabled by the interlock chain being all closed
 (which also pulls in RLY2 to power the tube filament and precharge the main
 filter capacitor bank).  It counts 2048 pulses from the power line, about 35
 seconds.  When Q12 (2**11 bit) goes high, RLY1 is turned on to enable tube
 startup and also pulls the clock input high via D22 so that the CD4040 stops
 counting and remains with Q12 set.  If any of the interlocks open, it is
 reset (and RLY1 and RLY2 are shut off).
<p>
<li>PWM controller - The 150R uses a typical switching regulator controller IC,
 the SG3525 (IC1).  The output of a ramp (sawtooth) generator is applied to a
 voltage comparator with the loop error signal as its other input.  The
 comparator output is high only if Ve is greater than Vosc.  This implements
 pulse width modulation (PWM) control since the duty cycle of the resulting
 comparator output will be proportional to the error signal.  The (constant)
 oscillator frequency (about 200 kHz) is set by R6 and C9.  The Duty Cycle
 control sets the Standby tube current.  Q1-Q3 and associated components are
 used provide the required drive signal to the isolation transformer, T2, for
 the MOSFET chopper transistors.
<p>
<li>Inner (primary) loop - This uses proportional/integral control to set the
 Standby tube current using current feedback only.  The error amp (IC2A) has
 a resistor and 3 series RCs in its feedback loop.
<p>
<li>Standby - The Standby switch disables current and light feedback modes (by
 forcing the outputs of their error amps, IC3C and IC3D, to 0.  In addition,
 the PWM Duty Cycle control is *enabled* forcing tube current to the value
 determined by the Standby and PWM Duty Cycle controls.  Its error amp (IC2B)
 is a straight integrator.  This also sets the minimum tube current when in
 Operate mode (i.e., the light and current controls are turned all the way
 down).
<p>
<li>Current feedback - This uses integral type control in its error amp (IC3C).
<p>
<li>Light feedback - This uses integral type control in its error amp (IC3D).
 The light feedback sense signal from the laser head is buffered and inverted
 in IC3B (and also buffered in IC3A).
<p>
<li>The I-Max control sets the maximum tube current.  Note that both current
 and light feedback are active in Operate mode.  Whichever has a greater
 setting (actually greater error voltage) will be in effect.
</ul>
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Configuration on older units is done on the 22 pin remote connector (P1 on the
<A HREF="532hsch.gif">Omni-532 laser head</A>).
<p>
Usually you ground the current input if using light and vice-versa.  The 150
and 150R can be configured each way.  You also have a choice of using the head
pot or the pot on the side of the supply, the supply pot is brought out on the
remote connector, and if your not using the remote, you have to put a plug on
the remote connector with jumpers. The CDRH requires a remote interlock jumper
on Class IIIa and up so they use the 22 pin connector for that as well.
<p>
But most 150s only run light, and wiring them for current as per the book
results in oscillation despite the book saying it can do either.

<h4><A NAME="ascom14">Omni-532 Laser Head</A></h4>

The <A HREF="532hsch.gif">Omni-532 laser head</A> includes the air-cooled
argon laser tube and its HUGE fan(s), igniter, light sense circuitry, and
test jacks.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argon laser tube - The ALC-60X/Omni-532 typically uses an external mirror,
 air-cooled tube (see the chapter: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton
 Ion Lasers</A>).  However, an internal mirror tube could be used with the
 same power supply.  Associated are one or two cooling fans, a thermal
 protector (interlock switch), and the light sensor.
<p>
<li>Igniter - The boost supply powers both a relaxation oscillator consisting
 of a unijunction transistor, Q1, R7, and C4, and the igniter storage
 capacitor, C8.  Q1 generates a trigger pulse to SCR1 several times a second.
 The igniter transformer, T1, is wound on a 2.5 inch diameter toroidal ferrite
 core with a 1.5 turn primary and 30 turn secondary using #14 wire.  The SCR
 discharges the igniter storage capacitor, C8, into the primary of T1
 resulting in an 8 to 10 kV starting pulse.  The snubber components (CR4 and
 R19) and tuning capacitor (C12) assure maximum output pulse amplitude with
 minimal undershoot (which could just as easily shut off the tube as start it
 up!).
<p>
 (From: Jerry (jbiehler@inetarena.com).)
<p>
 <blockquote>
 "Larger Omni Ar/Kr ion laser heads like the 543 and 643 don't use a boost
  voltage for the igniter like the 532 but the anode voltage instead.  On the
  ignite card, there is an opto-isolator that enables the igniter. This is
  controlled from a +15 volt signal provided by the PSU through pin 12 on the
  umbilical. The card inside the head has a connection to the current monitor
  connection and to the time delay circuit output. When you turn the laser on,
  pin 12 goes high (+15).  When the timer runs out, the 15 volt signal to turn
  on the main relay also sends a signal to the card causing pin 12 to go low
  and fires the ignite card. Once there is current flow, pin 12 goes high when
  the card senses a signal from pin IC2-8."
 </blockquote>
<p>
 For non functioning trigger modules, check the trigger capacitor (C8):
<p>
(From: Michael Herrera (mikeherrera34@msn.com).)
<p>
 <blockquote>
 "I am an ex-Omnichrome laser and power supply tech.  When I first started
  working for them, I noticed a high failure rate of trigger boards that I
  began to track.  So I built a test model and began going through all the
  old PCB failures.  I descovered that our vendor had been using 2 different
  suppliers for the trigger caps.  One was yellow and the other was white.
  They both looked and worked the same except the yellow brand would yield
  a higher failure rate.  I submitted an engineering change order (ECO) to our
  Engineer and he concured with my data.  The ECO was approved and the vendor
  was notified to drop the yellow brand which in turn reduced our failure rate
  for that problem by about 80%.  If I recall correctly the good vendor was
  SPRAUGE."
 </blockquote>
<p>
<li>Light control - A solar (photovoltaic) cell provides a current proportional
 to laser beam intensity.  The preamp is in the 532 laser head and includes a
 sensitivity adjustment (R13).
</ul>
<p>
Although, not obvious from the head or power supply schematics, apparently,
a failure of the light card can result in the laser operating at the power
supply current limit even if it isn't wired for light feedback:
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
When the Omni-150 slams to its current limit, the light sensor card in the
head is malfunctioning. It is either misadjusted or needs both the opamp and
the transistor replaced. A remote possibility is of course bad connections,
but odds are the semiconductor parts on the light card are dead. They are
exposed to heat and igniter pulses, and fail easily. I recommend using the
metal cased versions of the 2N2222 transistor on the light card as they
seem to do better then the plastic ones.
<p>
If there is no light feedback signal, the PSU defaults to maximum current,
no matter how its controls are configured. Too much light feedback signal
will cause the unit to oscillate, and too little will cause it to slam to
max current.  The potentiometer should be adjusted for 2.2 to 2.4 volts at
maximum laser  output.

<h4><A NAME="ascom15">Omni-PSU to Laser Head Interconnect Wiring</A></h4>

The information below should enable you to construct a cable between your
power supply and laser head or understand the wiring of an existing cable.
However, read this section in its entirety to make sure which portions apply
to your particular models.
<p>
Note: To get your system to run also requires a couple of jumpers on the remote
connector (the other large round AMP thing).  See the section:

<p>
ALC-60X/Omni-532 head cables are wired 1 to 1 pin for pin from the laser head
to the power supply, there is no magic interconnect diagram for them. 
<p>
However some of the wires require special attention:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pins 1 and 22 are the cathode leads and need to use at least #10 wire.
<li>Pin 6 is the anode and needs to be beefy as well, at least #14.
<li>Pin 9 is the Earth/Safety Ground and should also be at least #14.
<li>The +/-15V power and light signal leads should use a shielded cable.
</ul>
<p>
The head cable should be limited to a maximum length of around 9 feet.
<p>
WARNING: These pinouts do NOT apply to NEC GLG3020, GLG3030, OR GLG3050 series
heads even though they use the same connector.  Connecting a NEC head to an

issues go far beyond just the differences in pinout and CANNOT be resolved by
simply rewiring the connector.  See the section:

</PRE>
Notes:
<ol>
<p>
<li>Thermal/fan interlock wires also run outside of the head, among with the
 two 115 VAC wires for the fan. Use an ohmmeter to locate the fan wires and
 interlock wires by measuring from the pins on the connector to each of the
 four wires. Cross-connecting a fan wire to an interlock wire will severely
 damage the Power supply.  It is highly recommended that the factory practice
 of using a 4 pin connector to the fan be followed, with the interlock wires
 jumpered together on the fan side of the connector. That way, the power
 supply will not start the laser unless the fan is properly attached.
<p>
<li>For those building or servicing power supplies, note that a 100K resistor
 inside the PSU must be with the pin marked 'Boost via 100K'. Failure to
 have this installed or reversing these two leads will result in igniter
 failure and/or tube damage!
<p>
<li>The ALC-60X/Omni-532 is an OEM laser and thus not all pins will be
 connected or in use. Having a pin 4 on the connector is a dead give-away that
 you have a supply that uses 230 VAC North American or 250 VAC 50 Hz European
 power. A system of this type will not run from North American 115 VAC power
 lines without a tap change or transformer change inside the PSU (it can be
 run from a stove/dryer connection that provides 230 VAC). If pin 7 is present,
 the unit has external ignition shut-off, consult your vendor or the factory.
<p>
 <b>Important:</b> laser heads with a built-in hardwired umbilical permanently
 attached use a different PSU and pin-out even though the connector is the
 same - consult the vendor/factory before use.  The Power supplies designed
 for North American use will be missing pins 4, 7 and 12.  Omnichrome power
 supplies can be jumpered to use either the control pot on the head or on the
 PSU.  See the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom16">Differences Between
 Domestic and European ALC 60 Heads</A>.
<p>
<li>"High" and "Low" ends of the pot refer to the output power.  The high-end
 is typically connected to Common while the low-end is connected to +5.1 VDC
 in the Omni-532 laser head.
<p>
 While the Omnichrome 532 and American Laser 60X are designed to be
 interchangeable, there are some differences. Omnichrome heads are designed to
 operate in light control mode and will not have a current sense pin on the 22
 pin connector. The AC power LED on the head is powered by +15 Volts from the
 the light control card in the ALC 60X, but by -15 Volts in the Omnichrome
 laser heads.  Some of the common 'clone' power supplies (e.g., those built by
 MWK (currently <A HREF="http://www.mwklasers.com/">MWK Laser Products</A>,
 formerly MWK Industries) do not support the light control cards and thus not
 all jacks on the side of the head will work. On the MWK PSUs, the Current
 jacks on the side of the head will still work, as will the overcurrent light,
 but the light jacks will not function as the light card is not used by the
 MWK supply.
<p>
 The over-current LED is a relative indicator of tube current and was designed
 for use in a photocopier. When the laser is used in light show applications
 at currents up to the 10 Amp tube limit, this is NOT a true over-current
 warning. On ALC built units, you must press the button on the side of the
 head for the jacks to function.

<p>
On the Gold Box power connector, pins 1 and 6 go to the 115 VAC Hot line
(black wire), Pins 2 and 7 go to the 115 VAC Neutral wire (white wire), and
pin 4 is Safety/Earth Ground (green wire).  Pins 3 and 5 are unused and
may not have any contacts installed.
<p>
One set of the AC power pins is the main feed which goes through a line filter
on some versions and then to the main contactor contacts.  The other two power
pins go indirectly to a relay or directly to the main contactor coil, again
depending on the model.  Either way, the second set is for the on/off
function only.
<p>
Omni PSUs need a remote interlock, Gold Boxes don't as they were designed as
an OEM system and the printer or photocopier provided a interlock which dumped
the 110 VAC relay which is on 6 and 7 of the AC connector. That's why there
are 4 hot pins on the power connector - 2 of them are the main interlock.
The 9 pin "barn" connector (it looks like a barn or house in side profile) is
a passive interlock on every unit I've seen.  It has 2 open collector
optoisolators as outputs for "power on" and "tube lit", and one LED input for
an optoisolater that forces standby - apply 5 to 12 VDC and it drops to
standby.  In other words, it lases unless you apply a voltage to that input.
Here is the pinout:

All optocopulers are 6N25s.  Each pin has a choke in series with it and a
0.1 uF ceramic cap to chassis ground.  Q4 has a protection network of a 1N914
diode and a 0.01 uF cap across it.
<p>
Putting an optional on/off switch in series with pin 6 of the power
connector will enable cool down of the laser after shutdown by those power
supplies that have a fan shutdown timer. For other PSUs, this will just leave
the fan and tube filament on when the unit is plugged in. The laser should
have 2 to 3 minutes of fan cooling after shutdown, but no more, as this can
lead to changes in the tube gas pressure and overstressed tube seals.  For more
details on fan installation, see the

<h4><A NAME="ascom15a">Omnichrome PSU Remote Connector Wiring</A></h4>

The following is reverse engineered from my Omni-150P power supply.  It also
applies to other Omni power supplies like the 150R and 160 with the 37 pin
round AMP remote connector.  THERE MAY BE ERRORS - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
<p>
The large AMP circular remote connector is soldered directly to a small PCB
(as are some pins of the AMP umbilical connector as well) with P4 (which mates
with J4 on the mainboard) and an unmarked 5 pin connector (which I call PX)
which makes with the JX connector and cable for the current control pot and
operate keyswitch.  To select the way the power supply operates for current
and light control, various pins need to be jumpered on this connector.
Special prewired plugs were sold for this purpose (probably at exorbitant
cost) but some female pins and jumpers or even just soldering directly to the
male pins will work just fine.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Current control using pot on PSU: Jumper pins 2 to 6.  This connects the
 wiper of the pot on the Omni-150 front panel to the current (drive) input.
 (This is how my Omni-150P was wired when I received it.)
<p>
<li>Current control using pot on laser head: Jumper pins 4 to 6.  This
 connects the wiper of the pot on the ALC-60X laser head to the current
 (drive) input.
</ul>
<p>
Note that 5.1 V on the current drive input only results in about 5 A of tube
current on some/many versions of the Omni-150 (including the one with the
<A HREF="150rcsch.gif">Omni-150R - Control Subsystem</A> schematic
referenced here where R25 is equal to 91K).  Changing R25 to 39K (or
paralleling the existing resistor with 68K) should result in a little over
10 A max.  Alternatively, using higher drive voltage (up to about 10 V) from
an external source) will result in proportionally higher tube current.  It's
possible that this was not corrected on these models since they were operated
in light control mode for their original application.  And, light control IS
what should be used for maximum stability and tube life anyhow.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Light control using pot on PSU: Jumper pins 2 to 3.  This connects the
 wiper of the pot on the Omni-150 front panel to the light (drive) input.
<p>
<li>Light control using pot on laser head: Jumper pins 4 to 3.  This connects
 the wiper of the pot on the ALC-60X laser head to the light (drive) input.
<p>
<li>Current and light control BOTH active using pots on PSU and laser head
 respectively: Jumper pins 2 to 6 and (separately) 4 to 3.  Whichever input
 results in greater tube current will take precidence.
</ul>
<p>
You also have to jumper pins 36 and 37 to complete the interlock chain.
<p>
The current and light drive inputs are just 0 to +5.1 VDC levels so an external
source could be substituted for either or both pots and will provide the same
range.  CAUTION: I wouldn't recommend using this approach for modulation
without confirming that the power supply's control loops remain stable at
non-DC input frequencies!  I do not know if this is the case.
<p>
(From: Michael Andrus (andrus@ccountry.net).)
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"When wiring up the remote connector, you can monitor the current and output
with out having to push the test button.  By connecting pin 26 and any common
pin to a meter with a 1V scale you can measure tube current.  It is in
(0.1 V)/A increments.  By connecting pin 29 and any common pin to a meter with
a 20 V scale you will get a 0 to 200 mW measurement.  I believe this has
a sensitivity of (0.1 V)/mW (not verified)."

<p>
I have one setting here for a retubing and decided to find the what was
needed to hook it up to my supply.  Connecting these to a normal 60X supply
will result in either a nonstart due to lack of interlocks or a explosion,
depending on model of supply used. 
<p>
How to tell if you have a 60C/60B - physical differences:

<ul>
<li>Two fans on the side instead of one on top.
<li>Umbilical is hardwired into the side of the head.
<li>There is no light potentiometer on the head.
<li>A neon emission is a on top.
<li>Laser safety warnings are in German.
<li>Hour meter is across the fan AC, not the light card DC.

<h4><A NAME="ascomcon1">Converting the Omni-150 from 115 VAC to 230 VAC
 Operation</A></h4>

This would be totally out of the question if the PSU used a linear regulator
since the power dissipation in the pass-bank would at least quadruple.  With a
switcher, it may be possible in principle but I wouldn't recommend any such
attempts without getting an actual parts list and procedure from someone who
has done it successfully - or from the original designer!  That is, unless,
you own a semiconductor Fab and can afford to blow out a few dozen expensive
MOSFETs in the process!
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
I have it from good authority that the difference between the 115 VAC and the
230 VAC version is changing the taps on the transformers, rearranging the main
filter capacitor bank to a series/parallel combination, and replacing a couple
other parts.  Said good info is from 2 Omni owners, one with a 543, which is
the 300 to 500 mW version with a stretched tube and a huge gas reservoir.
<p>
Here are the details:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The main filter is rewired with its 4, 200 V, 1,000 uF capacitors in a
 series/parallel arrangement to handle the higher voltage (300 to 350 VDC).
<p>
<li>The capacitor that filters the MOSFETs' output is (C35) changed to 450 V,
 220 uF (from 220 uF, 250 V).
<p>
<li>The control transformer is jumpered to run on 230 VAC.
<p>
<li>Check to see if the filament transformer has an unused insulated lead.
 This is used for the 230 VAC line instead of 115 VAC.  If not, use a 2:1
 isolation transformer to power it.
<p>
<li>There are no more MOSFETs added than to the Omni-532 PSU.  The spot for
 the 3rd MOSFET turns out to be for older types that didn't have the standoff
 voltage ratings of the newer models. 
<p>
<li>Remove 2 of the 4 diodes in the boost circuit and one of the resistors
 and/or jumper it.  This will make the circuit a voltage doubler instead of a
 quadrupler.
</ol>
<p>
Everything else is the same for the both power supplies.
<p>
(From: Pasi Arffman (pasi.arffman@otol.fi).)
<p>
I was told that the 230 VAC version of this PSU (Omni-151) has 4 MOSFETs
instead of 2 (2 pairs of 2 wired in series, then paralleled using 2 driver
transformer circuits that are identical to the those in the Omni-150R, the
drivers being fed by the same control signal) and the other transformers
(control, filament) with 230 V primary windings. Also a better voltage rating
for the chopper components.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
This may have been a one-of-a-kind hack job, who knows?  Sounds like a kludge.
It's obviously much more complex than needed.  It would appear that the
Omni-155 is the official 230 VAC version.

<h4><A NAME="ascomcon2">Converting the Omni-155 from 230 VAC to 115 VAC
 Operation</A></h4>

(From: Dave (ws407c@aol.com).)
<p>
The Omni-155 is one of the versions of the Omni-150 power supply designed
to run on 230 VAC *only*.  However, it is possible to convert it to 115 VAC
with a modest investment in $$$ and effort.  This conversion assumes that
the Omni-155 works in the first place on 230 VAC!
<p>
However, before proceeding with what will be a rather involved process -
especially if you're not handy with a soldering iron -
consider that using an Omni-155 as-is with a high current step-up
transformer may still be cheaper and definitely much easier and lower risk,
unless portability is a primary requirement. :)
<p>
If you decide to go ahead with the conversion, here is the general procedure:
<p> 
<ol>
<li>Remove twelve screws and top cover.
<p>
<li>Remove 5 screws and the back plate, and unplug fan.  Make note of fan
 and see if it is convertible to 115 VAC.  If not, find a suitable
 replacement fan.  (Mine was 230 VAC only.)
<p>
<li>Remove the 7 screws on the bottom to free the main board.
<p>
<li>Undo wires to main board (sliding board out of the rear of the case as you
 go) and note which goes where (cathode, anode, 2 mains, filament transformer
 plug, J2 lamp.  Pay particular attention to the orientation of the plug for
 J8 as this is the boost/boost through 100K resistor and if put on backwards 
 will be  a big problem.  (Think smoke.)
<p>
<li>Make note where the power cord enters the cabinet at the strain relief,
 the cord bending back and forth over time causes a high resistance point.
 Cutting off a short section of cord and redoing it helps keep the cord cool
 at this point.  Also make note to the crimped connections especially on the
 bridge rectifier as these turn brown and burn up with time, replace as
 necessary. 
<p>
<li>Remove the paper shield over the heatsink (screws also hold PCB with 4
 1,000 uF capacitors on it).  Be VERY CAREFUL while removing this paper shield
 as it is very close to the two delicate wires on L2 and you will rip them
 right off if you are not aware and put an end to this project. :-(
<p>
<li>Unplug the capacitor board and put aside.  Unplug the crimps from the
 bridge and prepare to remove the heatsink.
<p>
 Again, make notes of what you un plug and where they go.
<p>
<li>Remove C35 (100 uF/400 V) snubber cap to access the screws in the next
 step.
<p>
<li>Loosen and remove the screws/washers securing the 2 MOSFETs and the fast  
 recovery diode to the heat sink.  Carefully remove the 2 screws holding the  
 heatsink on bottom of board and carefully pull heatsink away. place the
 3 mica insulators on the heatsink and put the screws/washers back into
 the respective holes as well as the two mounting screws and plastic support
 insulator.  Remount the capacitor board and put this entire assembly off to
 the side.  We will return to it later.
<p>
<li>Stuck on top of the low voltage +/- 15 VDC supply power transformer
 with RTV silicone is a big coil (L1).  Carefully unsolder this and pry
 it off the top of the transformer.
</ol>
<p>
Side note: CAUTION/patience/yikes!  These CAD-drawn circuit boards are a
pain to unsolder for the holes seem to be the same diameter as the part
lead going through as well as  most of the part leads were tightly folded over
before they were originally soldered.  If not careful, you will pull the
entire via stack through and part of the trace off the board with the part. :-(
<p> 
It seems that the 155's are really 150's modified for 230 VAC and re labeled  
155. 
<p>
<ol start=11>
<li>The primary of the low voltage supply transformer will need to be
 reconfigured for 115 VAC.  I removed the transformer just to be sure.
 Sure enough, the foil traces were hacked under the transformer by the
 factory. :)
<p>
<li>Reinstall transformer.  Jumper the proper pins and remove the soldered-on
 jumper from the back of the board.
<p>
<li>While everything is apart, change the tap on the filament transformer
 to 115 VAC.  The wire that goes to J10 with F4 removed (in the 155) is
 the common tap for the selectable voltages on 115 VAC.
<p>
<li>The following components will need to be replaced:

With the advent of DPSS, I refuse to pay big $$$ for one of these Omnichrome  
supplies. :-) $700 to $900 is sheer madness!  The Omni 155 appears and does
on the average of 50 to 70 dollars and the conversion cost still keeps it
under $150.
<p>
At the time of this writing my converted 155 has been running at 8 A for
about 5 hours without a hitch.  I stuffed the board in a 150 chassis with
its filament transformer for the test.  And I haven't replaced C11, C12, and
C13 yet.  Just couldn't wait. :-)
<p>
I will however replace them when they come in for more filtering the better.
<p>
I (Dave) have acquired a large lot of MOSFETS for these supplies as well as
the fast recovery diode, and am willing to repair these for a fair price on a
case-by-case basis.  I do not have the room here to do this on a regular
basis.  Since I have been focused on these, they are actually very simple
to fix.  If your unit's L2 is melted down, this might not be a fix for me
for this part cannot be had without buying another unit.  Other than that,
let me know.

<h4><A NAME="ascomlow">Running Ion Tubes with Lower DC Voltage Ratings on the
 Omni-150</A></h4>

The Omni-150 was likely designed specifically for the Omni-532 with its
100 to 110 VDC tube voltage (maybe 95 V at end-of-life).  What about those
with lower voltage drops?
<p>
Unlike a power supply using a linear regulator where power dissipation is
huge and proportional to the difference between the rectified/filtered line
voltage and the tube voltage, and even thinking about this would be out of the
question.  For argon ion tubes like the NEC GLG3030 and some Spectra-Physics
models which may drop to as little as 80 VDC when in good condition, even less
at end-of-life (low pressure) and the voltage drop across the pass-bank will
increase by 15 to 25 V compared to a tube like the ALC-60X.
<p>
However, with a switcher, the limiting factor will likely be the maximum
voltage drop that the MOSFETs in the chopper can safely control and it would
appear that for the Omni-150 and similar designs, this is not dependent on
the tube voltage but is the voltage across the main filter capacitor bank.
<p>
My expectation is that running an Omni-150 with a lower voltage tube won't
cause serious problems for the supply since the European version of the
Omni-150 uses the same type MOSFET and it is switching about 150 V more
(see the previous section).  For a given tube current, the average current
through the MOSFETs will be the same but the duty cycle will be lower.  Their
power dissipation will probably increase slightly but this would only be of
consequence when running near maximum output current.
<p>
Whether this can be done without some critical readjustments I don't know.
The startup duty cycle (which runs open loop) may need to be reduced
and other adjustments will almost certainly be needed.  And, it is
<i>extremely</i> easy to destroy expensive parts like the MOSFETs if something
is not set properly or a pot is turned too far.  Thus, I really don't
recommend attempting this unless you have a copy of the complete Omni-150
manual containing the adjustment procedure (or a bag of replacement MOSFETs!).
<p>
Steve Roberts apparently once saw a client run an NEC tube from one of these
without blowing up either the power supply or tube but it was only for 30
seconds (though he did mention something about the tube appearing to undergo
nuclear fusion)!

<h4><A NAME="ascom17">Omnichrome Power Supply Failures</A></h4>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Unlike many other ion laser power supplies, these seem to always fail the same
way.  The difficulty comes from the way their case and PCB are made. When you
have a dead one, my bet is that both MOSFETs, the fast recovery diode, one
capacitor, and the +15 V regulator are dead.  Replace these and you are off
and running.  90% of the fail from 3 causes:  MOSFET failure, miswiring, or a
loose heatsink that breaks off the MOSFET leads where the cooling fan vibrates
the poorly mounted heatsink.

<h4><A NAME="ascom18">Omni-150 Power Up Sequence and Troubleshooting</A></h4>

Here is an example of the events that take place when the Omnichrome model
150 power supply is turned on (Main Power) with the interlock chain complete:
<p>
(Refer to the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom1">Omnichrome
150R Power Supply and 532 Laser Head (Omni-150R/532)</A> for the schematics.)
<p>
WARNING: For any testing, DON'T measure across the tube anode itself (past
the igniter transformer) while the igniter is pulsing - your meter will likely
be destroyed!
<p>
<ol>
<li>Ion tube filament power is applied via its relay (RLY2) and the preheat
 timer (IC4) counting 2048 cycles of the 60 Hz power line is started (about 34
 seconds).
<p>
 At the same time, the main filter capacitor bank is slowly charged via
 a separate rectifier diode and current limiting resistor.  Typically, it
 will reach about 130 VDC by the time the preheat timer expires.
<p>
<li>The Main relay (RLY1) is activated and the supply enters Standby or
 Operate mode depending on the position of the front panel switch.  Prior to
 the tube starting, about 160 VDC will appear between the Anode input to the
 laser head and the tube cathode, F1/F2 (Pins 8 and 1 or 22 of the umbilical
 cable, P1/J1, respectively).
<p>
 At the same time, the Boost multiplier is enabled ramping up to 400 to 500
 V across the SCR (Q3) on the igniter PCB in the laser head (and this plus the
 160 VDC across the tube).  The voltage on the Q3 will dip to near 0 V and
 charge back up each time the SCR triggers.
<p>
<li>Once the tube starts successfully, the Boost(100K) source is shorted out
 so the SCR and trigger circuit are disabled.  The voltage between the Anode
 input to the laser head and the ion tube cathode drops to the operating value
 of 95 to 105 VDC (depending on tube current and tube condition).
</ol>
<p>
Thus, if you are monitoring the voltage between the SCR anode and the tube
cathode when the system is switched on, the voltage should slowly climb to
about 130 V, then jump to around 160 V and ramp up toward 500 V.  At some
point, the UJT will trigger resulting in a dip in voltage and the 'tick' of
the igniter.  The voltage will then climb back up and the cycle will repeat
until the tube starts or something dies. :(
<p>
If the voltage doesn't go above about 160 VDC, the Boost source is not working
and the igniter will never be trigger.
<p>
To determine where the problem is located, it should be possible to run the
power supply with no laser head attached as long as the interlock chain is
complete and then carefully measure voltages at the end of the umbilical
cable.  See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom15">Omnichrome PSU to Laser Head Interconnect
Wiring</A>.  If Boost and Boost(100K) are missing, then the fault is probably
in the power supply.  Otherwise, check components on the igniter PCB in the
laser head.
<p>
There isn't much to the quadrupler in the power supply and if a bad part is
found almost any reasonable combination of 1N4007 diodes and caps from your
junk box should work for testing at least.  However, I'd quicker believe such
a failure is due to a bad connection or wiring problem than a blown component.
In fact, there is a 3 pin connector in the power supply (J8 on the connector
PCB) which is used for both Boost voltages, Boost and Boost(100K).  Check to
see if it is unplugged - perhaps someone before you was using the power supply
with a laser head not requiring a boost voltage for starting and unplugged it
to avoid getting zapped!  Possibilities in the laser head include a shorted
blocking diode (D1), or the SCR itself or nearby components.

<h4><A NAME="ascom20">Introduction to Omni-150 Schematics</A></h4>

Note: The following sections apply to the Omni-150 (no letter suffix).
The much more common Omni-150R and mostly similar Omni-150P are

<p>
There are two versions here - Rev B and Rev C.
These are likely the forerunners of the Omni-150R, above.  They have similar
characteristics but the implementation differs significantly from the
Omni-150R and Omni-150P, and there are more than just trivial differences
between the Rev B and Rev C.

<h4><A NAME="ascom21">Omni-150 Rev B Schematics</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="150cbsch.pdf">Omni-150 Rev B Control System</A>
 was drawn after reverse engineering the power
 supply as no information for this particular PSU seems to be
 available; the later Omnichrome 150R is well documented above.
<p>
 This schematic and the accompanying description may also be found

 Whybrow Laser Page</A>.
</ul>
<p>
The schematic does not show the low voltage power supplies (+/-12 VDC for
the isolated circuits and +/-15 VDC for the non-isolated circuits) as
these are simple linear regulator based supplies fed from 2
independent windings on the power transformer. Also not shown are the
HT rectifier and associated 3 x 2,200 uF filter capacitors and inductor,
the boost supplies, the filament (cathode) transformer or the pre-heat
delay circuit as these are all near identical to those in the Omni-150R
power supply (and I couldn't fit them onto a single A3 drawing sheet!). All
component references are my own as the PCB has no component references
anywhere.  Note also that the function references next to the 5 preset
pots have been deduced from the circuit and some may be incorrect.

<h4><A NAME="ascom22">Omni-150 Rev B Operation</A></h4>

This description is based on my own understanding of this PSU and may
be partially or completely wrong! Let me know if you think I've got it
wrong.
<p>
The circuit is split into two sections: the isolated external loop which
is connected to the remote interface connector on the front of the PSU
and the non-isolated inner loop which is connected to the HT (AC line)
supply.  The two loops are linked by opto-couplers OK1 and OK2.
<p>
<b>Inner loop:</b>
<p>
Initially the outer loop is inactive and all regulation takes place
within the inner loop, this is also the case when the power supply is
set to standby mode via the remote connector. R47 is in series with
the anode of the laser tube, when current flows, the current mirror
consisting of Q1 to Q5 produces a voltage across 100 ohm resistor R51, this
is approximately 130 mV/A of tube current. This monitor signal is fed
into IC3d which then drives opto-coupler OK2 which feeds the current
signal into the isolated outer loop. The current signal is also fed
into the feedback amplifier consisting of IC3c, IC3a and associated
components.  This amplifier has a flat frequency response between 0 and
1 Hz, and then rolls off by 3dB to 10 Hz and is flat again to 10 kHz where it
then rolls off at 3dB/octave. Diode D8 appears to be present to clip
the signal should fast transients appear in the current signal.
Without the diode installed, the tube and power supply become unstable
above 8 A (more on this later). IC3a is AC coupled and feeds the
noise component of the tube current back to the first amplifying stage
via R28, the noise control adjustment. R27 sets the standby current
to, nominally, 4 A.  R26 controls the gain of the circuit when
regulating on the outer loop. OK1 is initially switched off so the top
of R26 is nominally 0V therefore the feedback amplifier output depends
only on the setting of R27 and the tube current signal. The feedback
signal output from IC3c feeds into one of the error amps in IC4, a
TL494 SMPS controller; IC4's outputs are in parallel and drive IC5, a
DS0026 MOS inverter/driver which, in turn, drives the MOSFETs Q6 to
Q8.  As a result, IC4 is operated in an unusual inverted mode whereby
the switching FETs are conducting when the output of IC4 is off, so
the feedback signal goes into the non-inverting input of the error
amp. The internal oscillator of IC4 runs at 100 kHz, determined by R54
and C18.  And because the output control pin is grounded, the PWM output
from the device is also at 100 kHz. Note that the ground of IC4 is
connected to the -15 VDC power rail not 0 V.  This means that the operating
region for regulation is when pin 16 is between -11.5 V and -14.5 V.
When the voltage here is more negative than -11.5 V, the outputs of IC4
switch off causing the FETs to switch on and thus send maximum current
through the tube; this current is limited only by the internal
resistance of the HT supply circuit, the Rds of the FETs, the 2
current sense resistors (1 in the laser head) and the cabling
resistance.
<p>
Prior to tube ignition, IC3c's inverting input is negative with respect to
the non-inverting input.  The actual voltage depending on the setting of
R27. IC3c runs open loop at DC so the output swings to the +15 VDC rail
therefore causing the switching FETs to be turned on.  This protects
the FETs from any stray transients from the igniter circuit and the
high di/dt waveform through the inductors. When the tube strikes, the
current very rapidly rises to around 25 A, then falls slightly to about
18 A.  As a result, the current monitor signal is at around +2.3 V and
IC3c's inverting input now becomes positive with respect to the non-inverting
input, therefore the output of IC3c starts to fall to the -15 VDC rail at
a rate largely determined by C8 as D8 is now conducting and damping the
response of IC3c (see starting problem below); when the voltage
reaches -11.5 V the SMPS starts to regulate and the tube current
reduces until the inverting input of IC3c reaches 0 V, the PSU is now
in closed loop control at the standby current.
<p>
<b>Outer loop:</b>
<p>
The current monitor signal, isolated by OK2, feeds into the current
signal amplifier IC2d whose gain is set to produce 100 mV/A of tube
current.  This signal feeds out to the remote current monitor, pin 26,
of the remote connector and also into IC2b. IC2b is a threshold
comparator with its inverting input held at +180 mV derived from 9.1 V
zener diode D4 with R23 and R21 acting as a potential divider.  When
the inverting input becomes higher than +180 mV (1.8 A of tube current),
the output of IC2b goes high causing the current detect signal, pin
12, on the laser head connector to go to approximately +14 V via diode
D3.  This signal is not used in the ALC60X or Omnichrome 532 head, but
is used in larger models, particularly krypton filled types. IC2a acts
as an integrator with a time constant determined by R19 and C5; when
IC2b's output goes high, the output of IC2a will go low approximately
100 ms later, this pulls the cathode of OK1's LED low and enables OK1
thus putting the PSU into outer loop regulation. OK1 can be disabled
by putting the remote standby input, pin 34, on the remote connector
to a voltage of less than 0 V (e.g., -12 V on pin 24), thereby putting the
PSU into standby operation at approximately 4 A of tube current.
<p>
IC2c forms a reference voltage source that supplies the front panel
power control pot and the power control pot in the laser head with a
+5.1 VDC reference, adjusted with R23.
<p>
The current signal from IC2d is also fed into comparator IC1b where it
is compared to the voltage across R11.  R10 and R11 form a potential
divider reducing the 1 A/V current control signal on the remote
current control (pin 6 of the remote connector) to 100 mV/A.  Therefore,
when the current in the tube exceeds the current set at the remote
current control input, IC1b's output goes low.  R9 and C2 reduce the HF
gain of this stage to improve stability.
<p>
IC1c amplifies the light output signal from the laser head's optical
pick-up and this signal is then fed out on the remote light output,
pin 29, on the remote connector. The light output signal from the
laser head also feeds into IC1a where it is summed with the inverted
remote light control signal from IC1d, thus when the light output of
the laser exceeds the level set at the remote light control input, pin
3 (or pin 5), on the remote connector, the output of IC1a goes low.
<p>
IC1a and IC1b are connected, via diodes D1 and D2 respectively, to the
anode of the LED in OK1. When either (or both) IC1a or IC1b's outputs
are high, current flows in OK1 causing the voltage across R25 in the
inner loop to become negative.  This voltage feeds into the feedback
amplifier IC3c where it increases the current demand thus increasing
the duty cycle of the switching FETs. As the duty cycle of the FETs
increase, the light output and current in the tube rise until both
IC1a and IC1b's outputs go high again, thus regulation is achieved via
the outer loop. Current or light control modes can be used by leaving
the unused input open or the two modes may be combined by supplying
drive signals to both inputs, whichever is set highest will take
control.
<p>
<b>Starting problem on my Omni-150:</b>
<p>
I am having a problem running known good laser heads on this power supply.
When the tube first ignites, the current very rapidly rises to a high
value for approximately 1 ms; if the current remains at this high
level, around 18 A, the plasma is highly unstable and the discharge is
blown out,
<A HREF="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.whybrow/Images/ignitionfail.jpg">Chart
1</A> shows a typical ignition current waveform.  The
problem is that the current demand signal at IC4 pin 1 falls very
slowly as a result of D8 in the feedback loop of IC3c, taking 35 ms to
reach the regulation region of -11.5 V to -14.5 V (Chart 1 shows the
control signal with the control loop modeled in Spice), therefore the
arc becomes extinguished before the PSU goes into regulation.
Removing D8 causes pin 16 to reach this region in less than 200 us as
measured with my oscilloscope (the Spice model shows closer to 650 us,
see Chart 2) and the tube ignites first time every time, but if the
current is increased above 8 A, the plasma becomes very unstable and
the power supply breaks into oscillation resulting in rapid current
rise and, usually, the plasma extinguishing. If anyone has a
suggestion as how to improve the stability of the loop without
compromising the time it takes to start regulating, please contact me
via the email address above.  Thanks.

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Usually they say MARLIN Landmark on them, but one way to tell is to drive
your laser to 11 amps.  If successful, you don't have a Landmark, they melt
at 9.5 A. :) These have a smaller narrower box then the traditional X supply.
I'll try to get measurements and a schematic one of these days.
<p>
The other 5 pin umbilical connector on the PSU is for remote standby. If you
trace the wires on the card, one is the open collector transistor output of a
optocoupler that says the unit is lit. The other is a led in a optocoupler
that puts the unit into standby for cool-down/idle.  The opto has two 1K ohm
resistors in series with it, so you just apply enough voltage (5 to 9 V) to
light the opto while keeping the current to between 2 and 3 mA to avoid
burning out the LED,

<h3>NEC GLG-3030 Laser Head</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascne10">Introduction to NEC GLG-3030 Schematics</A></h4>

The NEC model GLG3030 is another small air-cooled argon ion laser that
frequently shows up on the surplus market due to its use in the graphics arts
industry.  However, unlike the Omni/ALC air-cooled lasers, this one uses an
internal mirror ion tube but with external mirror adjusters for fine tuning.
<p>
This is a well supported unit.  The tube is all glass and will do between 5 and
30 mW, depending on its condition. If it is the standard NEC power supply,
there will probably be a laser power meter and adjustable current/light
controls on the front panel, so you may run it at a very low power to maximize
its life and keep it reasonably eye-safe. It can be dialed down even lower - to
class II or IIIa  (laser pointer) power levels by detuning the cavity a little
for additional safety.  (The tube has internal mirrors but with some amount
of external adjustment range.)
<p>
The NEC GLG-3030 is suitable for displays, fluorescence experiments,
small laser shows, measurements, Michelson interferometers, exposing gelatin
to harden it, and a couple of years of science fair projects.  Just don't
expect to burn the walls or anything else with it.  The laser runs on 115 VAC
at a maximum of 13 A line current and at a maximum of 9 A of tube current.
<p>
Caution: While the same umbilical connector is used for both the NEC-3030
and ALC-60X/Omni-532, THEY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE AS WIRED!  It is likely that
the power supply (at lest) will be damaged if you attempt to power an NEC head
from an ALC/Omni PSU and vice-versa!  Note that the compatibility issues go
far beyond just the differences in pinout and CANNOT be resolved by simply
rewiring the connector.  See the section:
<A HREF=laserarg.htm#argmlh2">Compatibility Issues of ALC-60X and NEC Laser
Heads and Power Supplies</A> for the gory details. :(

The <A HREF="nec3hsch.gif">NEC-3030 Laser Head</A> includes the air-cooled
argon laser tube, fan, trigger circuit, ionized sense circuit, light sense
preamp, and test jacks.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argon laser tube - The NEC-3030 uses an internal mirror, air-cooled tube
 (see the chapter: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion
 Lasers</A>).  The tube also has external adjustments for mirror alignment.
 Associated with the tube is a cooling fan, a thermal protector (interlock
 switch), and the light sensor.
<p>
<li>Trigger (igniter) circuit - The anode B+ supply powers both a relaxation
 oscillator consisting of a unijunction transistor, PUT301, R302, and C302,
 and the igniter storage capacitor, C301.  PUT301 generates a trigger pulse
 to SCR301 once every several seconds.  The igniter transformer, T1.  The SCR
 discharges the igniter storage capacitor, C301, into the primary of T1
 resulting the starting pulse.  Note that this type of design
 doesn't actually generate a single high voltage pulse, but a modestly
 high burst of high frequency superimposed on the normal tube voltage, sort
 of like a mini-Tesla coil.   This is considered easier on the tube cathode
 avoiding the pitting that can potentially occur with high voltage high
 current pulses.  So, that spark gap is intended to fire on each starting
 attempt, just as in a Tesla coil.

<li>Light control - A solar (photovoltaic) cell provides a current proportional
 to laser beam intensity.  The preamp is in the 3030 laser head and includes a
 sensitivity adjustment (R101).
<p>
<li>Ionized sense circuit - this shuts off the trigger circuit once the tube
 has started.

<h4><A NAME="ascne13">NEC PSU to Laser Head Interconnect Wiring</A></h4>

The NEC power supply is very nearly a clone of the Spectra-Physics model 261B.
NEC laser heads use an AMP (circular) connector for the umbilical and some NEC
PSUs use this as well.  However, a "Jones" style (rectangular) connector with
the SP-261B pinout is used at the power supply on most of the NEC PSUs.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsp10">SP-161 PSU to Laser Head
Interconnect Wiring</A>
<p>
Together, this information should enable you to construct a cable between your
power supply and laser head or understand the wiring of an existing cable.
However, read this section in its entirety to make sure which portions apply
to your particular models.
<p>
Some of the wires in the umbilical require special attention:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pins 1 and 22 are the cathode leads and need to use at least #10 wire.
<li>Pin 6 is the anode and needs to be beefy as well, at least #14.
<li>Pin 9 is the Frame/Earth/Safety Ground and should also be at least #14.
<li>The +/-15V power and light signal leads should use a shielded cable.
</ul>
<p>
The head cable should be limited to a maximum length of around 9 feet.
<p>
WARNING: These pinouts apply to NEC GLG3020, GLG3030 OR GLG3050 laser heads.
They DO NOT apply to ALC/OMNI series heads even though the same connector is
used.  Attaching an NEC head to an Omni or ALC supply will result in PSU
failure.  Note that the compatibility issues go far beyond just the
differences in pinout and CANNOT be resolved by simply rewiring the connector.
See the section: <A HREF=laserarg.htm#argmlh2">Compatibility Issues of ALC-60X
and NEC Laser Heads and Power Supplies</A> for the gory details. :(

<p>
I just did a little staring at the the schematic.  Something they neglect to
mention in the NEC manual is that there are opto-couplers in the interlock
circuit, on the interface card, and these are used to isolate external
standby and interlock signals. What they didn't mention is there are jumpers
inside the supply, to power up the LEDs used in the opto-couplers. So
depending how the jumpers are set, it either needs external 12 to 15 V to
light the LEDs and fire the unit up (jumpers removed), or a just a short
across the interlock and standby pins (jumpers installed).  Hence the insanity
caused by some people's units not firing up, while others do.  Also it needs
the fan wired through the head connector to power the interlocks on some units,
using a external fan voltage direct from the wall may not work.
<p>
Talk about a stupid thing to omit from the manual - a two configuration
connector! I'm NOT nuts, and they are both right.  The same pins are used
for the interlock and standby, they just can be configured either for a
short or a external voltage to close the circuits.

<h3>Cyonics/Uniphase 2201 Laser Head and Power Supply (CU-2201)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="asccu2d">CU-2201 Basic Description</A></h4>

This family of lasers includes single line and multiline models with power
outputs of up to 50 mW and beyond.  A typical example is the 2201-40MLA which
is rated at 40 mW, multi-line (total all lines: 488 nm, 514.5 nm, and several
others).  When new, the actual output power may be much greater than this
at maximum current.  It is a rectangular box about 5" (W) x 5" (H) x 12" (L).
<A HREF="cu2201-1.jpg">Cyonics/Uniphase Model 2201-40MLA 488 nm, 10 mW,
Air-Cooled Laser Head</A> shows this model with its fan and umbilical.
<p>
A complete operation manual for these lasers can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.junktronix.com/ebay/proddocs/cyonics2201.pdf">Cyonics/Uniphase 2200 Series Argon Ion Laser Operation Manual</A>.
<p>
The 2201-40MLA uses a tube like the <A HREF="cutube1.jpg">Cyonics/Uniphase
Model 2301 Internal Mirror Ion Tube</A>.  The <A HREF="cu2201-2.jpg">CU-2201
Interior View</A> shows the 2301 ion tube, Start PCB at the top of the photo
and the Light Sense PCB at the right by the output aperture.
<p>
Powering this unit should be even easier than the model 2214 since in addition
to no requirement for a boost supply, the starting is automatic so there is
not even any need for an external enable signal.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#asccu1">Cyonics/Uniphase Model 2214 Laser Head
(CU-2214)</A> for more information keeping in mind this difference.
<p>
Normal tube voltage should be in the 90 to 95 V range at 8 A.

<p>
The tube voltage may be measured at the connector between Filament 1 or 2
(DC-, pins 1 or 22), and Starter Board P2-IN (DC+, pins 6 or 7).  Although
the filament terminals aren't strictly DC-, as they have half the AC filament
voltage on them, the AC component will be ignored by a DC-reading meter.
CAUTION: DO NOT attempt to measure the tube voltage at the tube anode!
Your meter will blow up when the tube attempts to start, or restart!
To get at the pins while the connector is plugged in, loosen the strain
relief screws and unscrew the strain relief shell.  Meter probes may then
be poked in alongside the wires to make contact with the connector pins.
WARNING: Line connected DC voltage on these pins when the laser is powered!!!

<h4><A NAME="asccu2s">CU-2201 Starter Schematics</A></h4>

The only diagram I have is for the <A HREF="2201ssch.gif">Cyonics/Uniphase
2201 Start PCB</A> (courtesy of Alfons Roerdink (roerdink@yahoo.com).
The circuitry on the left senses when the input voltage is greater than about
130 VDC indicating that the tube hasn't started.  This turns the transistor in
the opto-isolator off enabling the unijunction transistor (Q1) based
relaxation oscillator to run. triggering the SCR (Q2) once or twice per second
dumping the charge stored on C2 through the pulse transformer (T1).  The
construction of T1 appears to be similar to that of the pulse transformers in
the Omni/ALC laser heads with its 2 turn primary and 60 turn secondary wound
with thick wire wound on a toroidal ferrite core.
<p>
(From: Nick Andrews (nicothefabulous@hotmail.com).)
<p>
My starter board is slightly different than the schematics, above.  It is a
revision J, marked CH937-104 and is simpler than the Rev 6 board, lacking
everything to the left of R10 (470K, connected to U1).
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
For this version, it must be the responsibility of the power supply to disable
the starter once the tube is running, or else it just keeps pulsing forever!

<h4><A NAME="asccu2p">Notes on the CU-2201 Power Supply</A></h4>

The power supply for the CU-2201 is the model 2101.  As usual, there are
various versions.
<p>
(Portions from: Werner Bleckwendt.)
<p>
These power supplies do not have personality boards.  The LEDs inside the unit
have the following meanings:
<p>
<ul>
<li>LED1: Bank voltage OK.
<li>LED2: AC GO on.
<li>LED3: "A" side Vcc up (+15 VDC).
<li>LED4: Primary interlock up.
<li>LED5: Charge off.
<li>LED6: Secondary interlock OK.
<li>LED7: Current feedback loop disabled.
<li>LED8: "B" side power up (+/- 15 VDC).
<li>LED9: Power-up delay timer OK.
</ul>
<p>
Testing the PSU without a head connection won't damage anything but you'll need
to close the interlock chain and provide dummy loads for the filament and tube.
CAUTION: The dummy load for the filament can be a suitable length of wire
that matches the resistance of the hot filament.  However, for the tube,
using a resistor may result in smoke since it expects the tube voltage drop.
Leaving the anode circuit open is probably OK for quick testing of the anode
and start voltages as this is similar to attaching a head with tube that won't
start.

<h3>Cyonics/Uniphase 2214 Laser Head and 2114 Power Supply (CU-2214)</h3>

Much of the information in these sections also applies to the virtually
identical 2212/2112 and others in the Uniphase 221X/211X product line.
One of the major differences may relate to the maximum current: 8 A for the
2212, 10 A for the 2214, and possibly around 13 A for the 2213.  These
are unconfirmed and I don't know if there are actual design differences
or just the setting of some undocumented internal pot!  The 2212 and 2214
run on 100-240 VAC while the 2213 only runs on 200-240 VAC (all jumper/switch
selectable).
<p>
Note: A "2" in the second digit of the model denotes laser or laser head
while a "1" denotes power supply and "3" denotes the bare tube (though I
don't know if the other numbers are identical for the bare tube).
<p>
A complete operation manual for these lasers can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.junktronix.com/ebay/proddocs/JDSU%202010%20Operation%20Manual.pdf">JDS Uniphase 2010 series Argon Ion Laser Operation Manual</A>.

<h4><A NAME="asccu1d">CU-2214 Basic Description</A></h4>

This family of lasers includes single line and multiline models from 3 to
50 mW and beyond.  A typical example is the 2214-30SLT which is a single line
488 nm (blue) cylindrical head about 3" in diameter and 15-1/4" long.  Another
similar one is the 2214-20GL which is single line 514.5 nm (green).
<A HREF="cu2214-1.jpg">Cyonics/Uniphase
model 2214-10SL 488 nm, 10 mW, Air-Cooled Laser Head</A> shows a unit that
is physically similar to these.  A partially disassembled laser head is shown
in <A HREF="cu2214-2.jpg">Cyonics/Uniphase
Model 2214 in Pieces</A>.  The internal mirror argon ion tube is in the
center with the light sensor PCB visible as the circular green thing at the
bottom. For some reason, the igniter isn't present or isn't visible in this
photo.  Sources for CU-2214s (with or without power supplies) include
laser surplus dealers and eBay.
<p>
Note: To remove the mounting ring assembly that may be present on some of
these lasers non-destructively, unscrew the 6 hex studs, loosen the 8 Allen
(hex) set-screws (4 around the outside of each stainless steel ring), and
unbend and pull out the two steel strap ends and and/or cut them off.  Then,
slide the inner and outer rings off of the front of the laser head taking
care not to scratch the fabulous paint job. :)  Finally, peel off the two
strips of protective polyimide tape.
<p>
The 2214-30SLT and 2214-20GL use a tube similar to the
<A HREF="cutube1.jpg">Cyonics/Uniphase Model 2301 Internal Mirror Ion Tube</A>
except for the slightly different mounting/heatsinking arrangement and lack of
shroud (I didn't disassemble the heads I had access to quite far enough to read
the label!).  The igniter is inside the plastic 'wart' visible in the photo
of the intact laser head.  The essential blower mounts on the rear.  A
shop-vac (clean and with filter in place) set to suck can probably be used for
testing. :)
<p>
It is trivial to power these lasers from any sort of argon ion laser power
supply suitable for 100 to 110 V tubes including all of the designs given in
this chapter.  The only required connections are for the filament/DC- and DC+.
There is no need for a boost source as the igniter operates from DC+ alone and
Cyonics/Uniphase tubes practically start on their own in any case.  Starting
is initiated via an opto-coupled DC enable signal (anything between 9 and 15
VDC should work).  The head includes a sensor and preamp to provide the light
feedback signal.
<p>
I used SG-IX1 to test one of these units with the suction connection (with
flower pot hose adapter) of a vacuum/blower from a defunct 9 track tape
drive for cooling.  A 9 V battery enabled the starting trigger - just connect
until the tube lights up or leave on to restart automatically if needed.  The
tube voltage on this particular sample was correct at around 105 V, not varying
much for the 3 current settings produced by SG-IX1: 3, 4.5, and 7 A.  (The 3 A
setting is marginal - the current gradually dropped to 2 A over the course of
a few seconds (with rising tube voltage) at which point the discharge went out,
worse when hot.  This appears to indicate a negative resistance region of the
discharge characteristic which should be avoided since it is hard on the
cathode.)  Note that these currents are slightly lower than when running
SG-IX1 with may home-built Cyonics laser head indicating a slightly higher
tube voltage (which may mean a newer/lower mileage/healthier tube.)  Slight
adjustment to mirror alignment was indicated - it wasn't far off but reduced
power quite significantly.  Gently rocking the rear mount with a close-fitting
cardboard tube or pressing on the front mount with a wooden stick was enough to
peak the output power!  Locking collars would be more than adequate to adjust
alignment but they were missing from this tube for some reason.  I later
added locking collars from a defunct Melles Griot HeNe laser tube and was
able to tweak the power up to almost 30 mW at 10 A.  Adjustment of only the one
at the cathode-end was sufficient to achieve this power increase; doing them
both might get a bit more.  Adding the locking collar at the cathode-end is
trivial but the one at the anode-end requires removal of the light sensor PCB
and its mounting plate - more disassembly than I would have liked.  It's in
there now and could be adjusted if I find myself with absolutely nothing more
interesting to do. :)

<h4><A NAME="asccu1s">CU-2214 Laser Head Schematics</A></h4>

The circuitry inside the CU-2214 laser head consists of two parts - the igniter
in a plastic 'wart' outside the main cylindrical case near the filament/HR-end
of the tube and the light sense preamp on a disk shaped PCB at the OC-end.
These schematics were determined by partially disassembling the laser head
and access to everything wasn't always convenient so there could be minor
errors in parts identification.
<p>
The diagram is available in PDF format:

<ul>
<li><A HREF="2214hsch.pdf">CU-2214-HEAD</A> -
  Cyonics/Uniphase-2214 Laser Head.  This includes the air-cooled argon ion
  tube and its associated fans and thermal protector, trigger circuit/igniter,
  and light sense preamp.  See below for more on the "Magic Blue Box" trigger
  module.
</ul>
<p>
The basic operation of the each of the major functional blocks are summarized
below.  For a more detailed discussion of the operation of the individual
circuits, see the chapter: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power
Supplies</A>.

<h4><A NAME="asccu1c">CU-2214 Circuit Description</A></h4>

The Cyonics/Uniphase-2214 Laser Head includes the
air-cooled argon laser tube, trigger circuit, ionized sense circuit, light
sense preamp, and high temperature cutoff.  The required blower is external.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argon ion laser tube - The 2214 uses an internal mirror, air-cooled tube
 (see the chapter: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion
 Lasers</A>).  No mirror adjustments are possible without the addition
 of locking collars or by more drastic means.
<p>
<li>Trigger (igniter) circuit - The anode DC+ supply to the "Magic Blue Box"
 (MBB) is enabled by applying 9 to 15 VDC to the opto-coupler, U1.  It would
 appear that there is a relaxation oscillator drivign a high voltage pulse
 transformer inside the potted MBB.  Thanks to Leslie Wright, we have a
 partial schematic of what's inside the MBB.  See
 <A HREF="cu2214tm.jpg">Cyonics/Uniphase 2214 Trigger Module</A>.  There
 is still uncertainty as to what some of the components are.  For example,
 the spark gap (SG1) may actually be a solid state device. :)
<p>
<li>Light control - A photodiode provides a current proportional to laser beam 
 intensity.  The preamp is in the mounted just behind the output aperture
 bezel.  There are adjustments for both gain (R3) and offset (R4).
<p>
<li>High temperature cutoff - This is a thermal switch buried in the tube's
 heatsink fins set to open at 200 &deg;F.  However, if your cooling is
 adequate, it should never have to be put to the test!  These are not designed
 for repeated cycling - it's only a last resort protective device and may
 become unreliable if you insist on using the overtemp cutoff as the signal
 to end your laser show! :)
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="asccu1i">CU-2214 Interconnect Wiring</A></h4>

The Power and Control/Light Feedback connectors are both on the end of a fat
cable permanently attached to the rear of the laser head.  Only 4 sets of
connections are required to power up the head (for testing at least): DC+,
F1/F2/DC-, Earth Ground, and Start Power (around +15 VDC) to the opto-coupler.
Of course, you really should monitor the Interlock thermal cutout!

<h4><A NAME="asccu1u">Notes on the CU-2214 Power Supply</A></h4>

A modern switching power supply that will power the CU-2214 laser head is the
Uniphase 2114P-40MLA.  Factory refurbed units have been showing on eBay
(Summer 2002) for $75 which is a very attractive price.  In
addition to the CU-2214, with minor (external) modifications, it may be capable
of driving other small air-cooled ion laser heads such as the ALC-60X and
SP-26x.  More info (including the remote interface specs) can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A>.
Search for "argon 2110 series power supply".
This is the same power supply, just
black instead of gold.  And of course no remote interface module, but it has
the mounting holes for it and the DB25 user interface connector.  There are
pins on the connector for interlock, power, and current control, and current
monitoring.  The laser is actually turned on or off normally via the
"Discharge" input.  When grounded, there is a 30 or 40 second delay
for the filament to heat, then the laser comes on at maximum current
for about 1/2 second before dropping back to the selected current or
power (or idle) depending on the states of other inputs.
<p>
Note: According to my manual, the 211xA supplies will only work on 100 or
120 VAC and the 211xB supplies are for 200, 208, 220 or 240 VAC.  The 211x
(without an A or B) can be strapped for 100, 120, 200, 208, 220 or 240 VAC.
The 211xP will also work on any voltage and can be changed without opening
the case.  So, double check to be sure the version you are considering will
work with your power!  Make sure your branch circuit can handle the load
(12 A or more at maximum tube current at 115 VAC) without sagging too much.
The power supply may buzz/whine on low line voltage.  While the laser will
still work, this may be stressful for it the power supply.  A dedicated
circuit close to the service panel would be best.
<p>
The Uniphase model 2114P and other similar power supplies a pair of mating
connectors for the cylindrical 2214 laser head (a square 9 pin AMP Universal
Mate-N-Lock connector for power and a round 14 pin connector for control/light
feedback.  See the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#asccu1i">CU-2214
Interconnect Wiring</A> for details.)  In order to operate the laser,
some simple circuitry is needed for the DB25 "User Interface" connector
as described in the next section.

<h4><A NAME="asccu1r">CU-2214 Remote Wiring and Control Panel</A></h4>

The CU-2214 laser is controlled via a DB25 female connector on the power
supply.  The pinouts and specs for all the signals, along with descriptions
of the analog and digital control panels may be found on the Uniphase Web
site, above.  The only discrepancies I know of relate to the monitor signal
sensitivities which may be model dependent (see below).
<p>
There are two remote interfaces listed on the Web site, above.  The model
2501 has some switches and knobs (no display) while the model 2500 has soft
touch buttons and a built-in digital display.  Note that based on the
wiring and mounting arrangement, the Spectra-Physics
361D remote interface should be compatible with these power supplies
(though I have not yet confirmed this).  It is somewhere in between the
2501 and 2500 with knobs and toggle switches but a digital display.
<p>
I built a remote control panel that is similar to the simpler
model 2501 except that I included a digital panel meter rescued from the
trash so current or power output can be monitored independent of the
mode of operation.  It has separate pots for current and light control,
a keyswitch for "Discharge On" (becuase I had one from a defunct PC case!),
and attaches via a 3 foot cable.  Everything is installed in a nice recycled
aluminum box. :)  Unless you're in love with digital controls, there is not
much additional benefit to having the model 2500.  In fact, mine is
functionally identical to the Spectra-Physics 361D.
<p>
Here's the schematic for another almost identical control panel:
<A HREF="http://www.junktronix.com/lasers/211x/211x%20remote%20interface%200.1.pdf">Kevin's Uniphase 211X Ion Laser Control Panel</A>.  (Note: The functions
of pins 8 and 9 are swapped and not everything else has been totally
verified.  I have fixed the swapped pins on
<A HREF="kccucp1.pdf">Kevin's Uniphase 211X Ion Laser Control Panel</A>.)
Mine has a hardwired interlock and uses the keylock switch
for Discharge On with the Emission LED tied to that as well, erring on
the side of caution as the LED will be on as long as the switch is on.
Since the LED DPM also requires more current than the 211X connector can
supply, my control panel must be plugged into a wall adapter if the DPM
is to be used.  But it is otherwise functionally identical to Kevin's.
<p>
The circuit below is even simpler but adequate:
<p>
(From: Chris Leubner (cdleubner@ameritech.net).)
<p>
I am lucky as I have a remote that goes to it, but I also have the manual
for these power supplies too and it is not much more then 1 or 2 switches,
one resistor, and a 1K ohm pot. :-)

 can be added if desired.)

 24. (Note: These pins are NOT earth ground, they are tied to earth through a
 1M resistance! Real ground is pin 25.)  This will allow 12 A in Current Mode
 or 60 mW in Light Mode which is perfect for those little single line heads.
 A total resistance between 1K and 10K should be fine if you don't have a

</ul>
<p>
This circuitry and a digital voltmeter sums up the remote control head.  I
wonder what they charged for it? :) (They did add a couple more switches
and separate pots.)
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The absolute minimalist wiring to see if the laser comes on would be a jumper
from Pins 1 to 3 for Interlock, and a jumper from Pins 13 to 2 for Discharge
On.  (The latter may not even be absolutely essential as the Discharge On
input may float to a high level if unconnected.)
And, of course, the Interlock Keyswitch on the power supply has to be
enabled.  After a 30 to 40 second delay, the laser should come alive pulsing
to maximum current for about 1/2 second and then dropping to Idle
current.  If the tube is reasonably healthy, there should be a beam
(and certainly during that 1/2 second), though it may be quite weak
at idle.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE COOLING if running for more
than a few seconds.  Even at idle, it's still dissipating the
equivalent of a small space heater!
<p>
There isn't any problem using separate pots for current and light
adjustments.  The only caution is the maximum available current from the
+15 VDC supply, 20 mA according to the Uniphase specs.  The light adjustment
sensitivity may depend on the particular laser head model (probably based on
the -XX output power rating).  Thus, adding a coarse
adjustment in series with the top of the light adjust pot would be desirable.
Same with the current adjust pot but to limit maximum current to a safe value
for your particular laser.  The sensitivity of the Power Monitor test point
also depends on the particular laser head model and may not agree with either
what is listed above (10 mW/V) or what is stated in the Uniphase specs
(10 mW/300 mV).  However, the sensitivities of 10 mW/V for both adjust and
monitor do appear to be accurate for the 2214-30SLT and 2214-20GLT.  I've
also used the same control panel for a 2212-4SLBK without even having to
adjust calibration.
<p>
I haven't figured out if I prefer the blue or green argon ion laser colors.
The 488 nm wavelength is blue that really wants to be green; 514.5 nm
is green that really wants to be blue.  I wish there was a small air-cooled
ion laser that did a nice yellow - the yellow HeNe at 594.1 nm is still my
favorite laser color.  What passes for yellow at 568 nm in a krypton
ion laser doesn't really qualify - it's a yellow that wants to be green! :)
<p>
Ron Cole (gr8mxr@verizon.net) has put together a basic control panel
including Enable, Idle/Run, and Current/Light switches, and separate
pots for current and light level.  Contact him for details and pricing.
If you really don't know which end of the soldering to grab, this
may be for you. :)
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
If an interlock fails, the PSU must be completely powered down for
5 seconds or more or it wont restart.  Some Uniphase PSUs apparently sense
filament current and head plug configuration as an interlock as well as the
two orange wires on the low voltage connector.  Some may even sense if the
filaments are warm.  The timing is digital.  The supply senses the power line
for 5 seconds to confirm correct voltage.  If that is correct, then the 40
second warmup delay provided you have good interlocks. Then it applies
voltage to the tube and initiates startup.

<h4><A NAME="asccu1t">Troubleshooting CU-2214 Starting Problems</A></h4>

The following assumes the use of the 2114 type power supply but should apply
with obvious modifications to other models.
<p>
The only connections that really matter for testing are the Interlock (pins
1 to 3) and Enable (pin 2 to +15 VDC).  Make sure the keyswitch on the power
supply is set to Run (1).  With power applied, the red Power LED and green
Interlock LED should be lit and the filament of the tube should heat up
for 30 to 40 seconds before the starter is activated.  The laser should come
on shortly after this, initially at maximum current, then dropping back to
the selected setting (Light, Current, or Idle) after a fraction of a
second.  If this doesn't take place as expected, check the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The orange glow of the filament should be visible through the mirror in
 the rear end of the tube.  If there is a sticker covering the mirror,
 unplug the laser head from the power supply (to avoid the chance of electric
 shock) and carefully peel it off.  WARNING: Don't stare directly down the
 bore.  Murphy's Law states that the laser will decide to start only if you do
 this and even the leakage through the HR mirror can be a vision hazard!
 If there is no glow, check wiring/filament continuity and for filament
 voltage from the power supply.
<p>
<li>After the 30 to 40 second delay, the starter should produce a periodic
 "tick-tick-tick" sound until the tube fires.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the ticks can be heard but the tube doesn't start or flash (it's safe
  to turn off the head fan to hear better for this test but remember to turn it
  back on if the tube does start), either the tube is up to air or has some
  other damage, or there is a problem with the wiring in the head as the
  starter runs off the same high voltage DC as the tube.  If the tube flashes
  but won't stay lit, the tube may be high pressure or there may be a problem
  in the power supply.  However, I've found that Cyonics tubes don't care how
  long they sit on the shelf - if the tube worked last time it was powered, it
  will probably work now.
<p>
 <li>If there is no ticking sound, check the voltage across pins 2 and 6 of
  the circular (DIN) connector.  There should be 9 to 15 VDC across these pins
  while the starter is activated.  If the voltage is present, there may be
  a problem in the head electronics or the high voltage DC may not be
  present at the head.  If there is no voltage, there is a cable wiring
  problem or the power supply isn't issuing the start command for some
  reason.
 </ul>
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="asccu1p">CU-2214 Pulsed Test Supply</A></h4>

Since no boost or other weird power or signals are needed, it is also easy to
see if the tube is good without the need for a full blown power supply.
Provide power to the filament (for this test it can be AC or DC as long as
you get the filament to be reasonably bright orange).  Charge up a 50 to 100 uF
200 V capacitor to 150 VDC from a current limited source.  (A higher uF cap
will produce a correspondingly longer pulse but shouldn't be necessary to just
get the tube to lase.)  Attach this via a 5 ohm 20 W resistor to DC+ with the
return to one of the filament terminals or the transformer centertap if
available.  With the laser pointed at a white surface and the beam shutter
open (controlled with that slotted-head screw visible on the side), connect a
9 V battery to Start+ and Start-.  You should get a flash of coherent light
within a second or so.  I haven't actually tried this simple test but it
should work. :)  Firing off a few shots like this won't damage the tube but
don't leave it running all night for entertainment!  (If the you can hear the
tick of the igniter resulting in the capacitor discharging down to about 100
V, but there is no evidence of laser output, most likely the mirrors are
misaligned.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrtoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser
Testing, Maintenance, Repair</A>.)

WARNING: No line isolation - take care.  The peak optical power output may
exceed 50 mW for an instant (peak current of more than 10 A) - don't be
tempted to stare into either end of the laser even if you think it isn't
working!  Add your own 9 V battery. :)

<h4><A NAME="ascjc1">Jon's CU-2214 Power Supply</A></h4>

(From: Jonathon Caywood (sarlock@no!spam.twcny.rr.com).)
<p>
I just got my Cyonics/Uniphase 2214-30SLT argon head running off of a
home-built power supply and I am so stoked! :)  I pretty much spent most of
the last several months considering the construction of this power supply, but
wanted to do it the 'proper' way with commercial components, and I've been
working on a CO2 laser, but that project is on pause due to a budget
restriction so I had some time for other things.
<p>
Well, I finally gave in on Friday and built a pulse supply for the head
(similar to the one described in the section:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#asccu1p">CU-2214 Pulsed Test Supply</A>) and watched it
make flashy spots on a white piece of paper.  Okay, now I knew it lased in
that mode and it was cool.  Seeing it do something gave me the gumption to get
it running CW since that is more desirable for an argon. :)
<p>
I started with the SG-IX1 design and an old computer case.  It was a pain in
the neck to string the resistance wire (from a space heater) around inside the
case, but I got it covered with my trusty nibbler (best thing I ever bought
from Radio Shack)  I left out the relays and switching systems for the
filament and such and did everything by unplugging and plugging in certain
electrical cords.  But I DID use fuses....  Always fuse. :)  I found an old
blower fan out of some piece of computer equipment (it slightly resembles the
original blower these heads use) and the head now has quite good airflow.  I
manufactured a 'duct' for the fan using some packing tape.  End result: After
about 4 to 5 hours labor and a small headache later, it runs great!  A lot
brighter than I expected from a this used laser head at any rate.
<p>
So for $50 and a few hours of work (and an aspirin tablet) I have a working
argon ion laser.  This sure beats paying $500 for a power supply alone. :) How
long it will last is anyone's guess, but it's a good initiation into ion
lasers for me.  Now that I know the head works fine, I'm going to work on
building a better supply with a pass bank, front panel controls, etc.
<p>
(Update: 05-27-2009)
<p>
I recently constructed a power supply based on SG-IY1 (with pass-bank) which
works great with my new 2414-40MLAM head.  It's not the most gorgeous piece
of equipment but it performs well and within the laser head's specification.
<p>

<h4><A NAME="asccusp">Running a Spectra-Physics 161B-Type Laser Head on a
 CU-2214</A></h4>

(From: Anders Hogrelius (ahs@hogrelius.nu).)
<p>
I recently bought what seems to be a copy of the Spectra-Physics
161B made by a German company called Lasos.  I also got a JDS Uniphase
2114B power supply.  Even though the JDS and SP lasers are very different,
I thought I'd try to make the laser/power supply
combination work.  It turns out it's pretty easy.  The only thing one needs
to do except getting a new connector is to rewire the interlock loop in the
laser.  In my case there were a couple of extra wires in the umbilical.
They came in handy to use for the interlock.  The original interlock/fan
wires were wired directly to the fan.  Since there are two unused pins in
the JDS connector, I used those for powering the fan.  I just hooked up the
extra pair to the pair of wires that runs from the PCB to the fan inside
the power supply.
<p>
I also had to replace the fan inside the laser since we've got 230 VAC power
here in Sweden, but that's another story.  Right now the laser is running
nicely on idle.  The next thing to hook up between the laser and PSU is the
light feedback loop, but since I haven't got the specs for either of the
sensors, I'll have to make do with running the laser in current regulated
mode.
<p>
In short: Yes, it is possible to run a Spectra-Physics laser on a JDS
Uniphase PSU, and it doesn't take too much work to do it.
BTW: the connectors on JDS Lasers that hook up to the PSU are:
<p>
<li><b>Power:</b> AMP Universal Mate-N-Lock Male, Male with pins
 9-pole AMP part number: 1-0480706-0.
<p>
<li><b>Feedback/interlock:</b> AMP CPC 14-pole Male inverted type
 AMP part number: 0-0182649-1.
</ol>
<p>
Both need pins that are sold separately.

"The 'jones' plug is, or rather was, made by Beau-Vernitron with the plug
 part number P-3315-AB and the socket being S-3315-AB. As far as I have
 been able to determine, neither of these are made any longer. The two
 sources I've found that still stock any of these, Newark Electronics has
 a 50 piece minimum order for that part, and USBid has a $250 minimum
 purchase for anything that comes through them. I think the scarcity of
 these plugs and sockets is worthy of note to anyone who has a psu that
 uses them."

<p>
I never liked Jones plugs anyhow. :) So, replacing them with something more
modern and secure may not be a bad idea in any case.
<p>
Note that although the connectors may match between some SP-26x power supplies
and SP-16x laser heads, the only combination I know will work (e.g., lase,
not blow up) is the SP-263C/SP-161C.  Others may be fine but better to check
before doing something you may regret.
<p>
The NEC power supply for these laser heads is very nearly a clone of the
SP-261B and in most cases they are interchangeable.  However, this must be
confirmed for your particular PSU-head combination.

<h4><A NAME="ascsp1br">SP-261B Remote/Interface Connector</A></h4>

Important: Pinout of the 37 pin connector is similar to the American/Omnichrome
remote but not identical.  Among the differences are the need for some
inputs and outputs to float above ground.  Remember that ion laser PSUs use
directly rectified line voltage to drive the plasma arc and thus have some
rather weird circuitry that often needs to float isolated from AC Hot, Neutral,
and Safety/Earth Ground. DO NOT USE LINE POWERED TEST INSTRUMENTS ON THESE
LASER POWER SUPPLIES!  Even isolation transformers may not be adequate unless
carefully checked out with a megger.  Isolation transformers may not isolate
the Safety/Earth Ground.)

I have the starter from an SP-161/162 laser head - the black box type.  Inside
some of the more modern ones is a very small PCB with two capacitors,
an inductor (on bobbin), a spark gap, and the main high-voltage module.  This
is the gray cylinder with two wires in (120 VAC In) and red wire out (-HV OUT).

<h4><A NAME="ascsp1cp">Common Problem with SP-261</A></h4>

(From: Dave.)
<p>
If you get a SP-261B power supply and it does not work, before you go nuts
trying to find the problem, pull the 'control card' and reconnect the burnt
or cold solder joints to the TO3 power transistor and you should be good to
go. :-)
<p>  
This seems to be a design flaw with these B series switchmode PSU's.
<p>
Also, if you are thinking of white-lighting a 60X, this is the PSU that
will mate it perfectly :-)

from a recent copy of the "Spectra-Physics Model 160-Series Laser Systems
User's Manual".

<h4><A NAME="ascsp2ls">SP-163C/263C Laser System Description</A></h4>

This is a medium power air-cooled argon ion laser system consisting of the
model 163C laser head, 263C power supply, and 361C controller (a control
panel with several switches, LEDs, and an analog meter for current and power).
There are a variety of other configurations with relatively minor changes
in features.
<p>
The SP-163C laser head uses an all metal-ceramic tube.  The mirrors
are internal with no obvious adjustments.  The laser head is just large
enough to hold the tube and have adequate space for air flow.  A 5"
high rpm muffin-style fan sucks air out the top.  The only electronic
components are a potted starter module, light pickoff sensor and PCB,
electrochemical elapsed time meter, a couple of surge suppressor
thingies, and an overtemp thermostat.
<p>
The modern power supply (the laser has a manufacturing date of 2000)
is very compact and light in weight - about 6.5 pounds. Looking inside,
there is no heavy filament transformer so I assume it uses a switcher
for the DC filament (20 A max) as well as the main DC tube current supply
(10 A max).
<p>
The rated output power is 40 mW, multiline, but the laser actually does
over 72 mW on 7 visible lines at 7.5 A tube current.  There are 6 lines
at the 4 A standby current.  The laser only runs in power (light feedback)
mode and there doesn't appear to be any way to set it for current mode,
despite what the manual says. The Current/Power switch on the SP-361C
only selects what the meter shows with no connections to the power supply
to change mode.  The test spec is 97 mW at 8 A (and the power supply is
rated 10 A max) but I haven't hacked it yet to get more power. :)
<p>
I should also note that the laser had been in storage under a table for
over a year but still had no problem starting.  Of course, it has seen
very little use with almost no running time showing on the meter. :)

                  turns the laser discharge off.  Leaving the pin open or
                  tied to +15 VDC turns the discharge on.  Filament remains
                  on.

        3       Interlock (Return) - Reference for pin 1.

        4       Run/Standby - Grounding this pin (referenced to pin 14) sets
                  the laser to Standby mode (minimum current, 4 A).  Leaving
                  this pin open or at +15 VDC sets the laser to Run mode.

        5       Power/Current - Leaving this pin open or at +15 (referenced to
                  pin 22) sets the laser to Power mode.  Grounding it sets the
                  laser to Current mode. 

        6       Current Control - 0 to 6 V applied to this pin (referenced to
                  pin 20) sets plasma tube current for 2 A/V.

        7       Power Control - 0 to 15 V applied to this pin (referenced to
                  pin 20) sets laser output for 0.1 V/mW.

        8       Power Monitor - Sensitivity is 0.1 V/mW between this pin and
                  pin 22.  Use high impedance voltmeter.

        9       Current Monitor - Sensitivity is 0.1 V/A between this pin and
                  pin 22.  Use high impedance voltmeter.                  

     10-11      Signal Common - Reference for pin 23.

       12       -15 VDC - Regulated voltage for user use, 20 mA max.

       14       Signal Common - Reference for pins 2 and 4.

     15-19      Not used.

     20-22      Signal Common - Reference for pins 5-9.

       23       Laser On/Off - Leaving this pin open or at +15 V (referenced
                  to pin 11) turns the filament (and after a ~60 second
                  delay), the discharge.  Grounding it turns the filament and
                  discharge off.  It basically acts like the key-switch.

<h3>Lexel-75 Power Supply Notes</h3>

The following was prompted by a desire to convert a Lexel-75 PSU wired designed
for three-phase 115/208 VAC Y to single phase 115 VAC.
<p>
(From: Brad Stockdale (brad@greenepa.net).)
<p>
After doing some tracing, it seems that the A/C front end goes something 
like this:

<ol>
<li>Power comes in through the three phase cord, and enters on to a barrier
 strip. The strip is labeled "120/240 VAC 3 Phase Wye".
<p>
<li>The power leaves the barrier strip, and enters a 3 pole relay (maybe
 considered a contactor? - lots of amperage!).
<p>
<li>From here, the power hops on to three wires, makes a few twists and turns,
 and eventually ends up on another barrier strip that is mounted on the
 pass-bank cold plate.
<p>
<li>Out the other side of the barrier strip, and in to three stud rectifiers.
 The output of the rectifiers are soldered together with some heavy bus wire,
 and the output of this junction is fed directly in to the filter cap (5,500
 uF and 200 V).
<p>
<li>The output of this eventually makes it in to the pass bank...
</ol>

An interesting note of the rectifier section of the cold plate. There are 
only three, but there are four holes. The fourth (empty) hole is labeled 
D4. So, it looks like it could MAYBE be converted in to a single phase 
system.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I would agree that conversion should be possible.  You may need additional
uF on the main filter, though 5,500 uF sounds like it should be enough.

<h3>Lexel-88 Power Supply and Laser Head (Lexel-88)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="asclx10">Introduction to Lexel-88 Schematics</A></h4>

Argon, krypton, and mixed gas ion lasers manufactured by
Lexel Laser, Inc. (out of business as of Sumer 2002) are the second most
common type available to the serious laser enthusiast after the
ALC-60X/Omni-532.  Therefore, schematics for at least one version of
a Lexel-88 power supply and laser head should come in handy.  And the
power supply for the Lexel-88 should be nearly identical to the
one for the Lexel-85 (and possibly others.
<p>
The particular model shown in the schematics uses a MASSIVE linear regulator
running off of a 230 VAC front-end for higher power Ar/Kr ion tubes requiring
more than 200 VDC at up to 35 AMPS!  You better be able to afford the electric
and (cooling) water utility bills!
<p>
However, since the circuitry is quite simple - especially the feedback loops,
it can provide the ideal basis for a scaled down design of your own.  By
substituting a 115 VAC front-end and using fewer transistors in the regulator
pass-bank, this basic approach would be suitable for a driving typical small
Ar/Kr ion tubes (e.g., 60X or Cyonics).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg3">Sam's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply
(SG-IL1)</A> for the exciting details.  In fact, the power supply for the
Lexel-75, a smaller cousin to the Lexel-88, uese this approach.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtsw">A Typical Small Water-Cooled Argon Ion
Laser - the Lexel Laser Model 75</A>.
<p>
Also see the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> for
for multiple detailed photos of several detailed views of the Lexel-75
and its power supply.

<h4><A NAME="asclx11">General Description of Lexel-88</A></h4>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<ul>
<li>The Lexel-88 Power Supply Unit (PSU) will do 7 to 35 amps into just about
  any ion laser tube.
<li>The Lexel-88 is the most common argon ion laser after the ALC-60X/Omni-532
  and produces 2 W.
</ul>
<p>
Important: Before lighting up your new (or used) Lexel laser, perform the
pass-bank test and select the proper tap setting on the buck-boost transformer,
measure the AC Volts test points and adjust the cathode switch setting (A,
B, or C) as needed.  Failure to do so may result in pass-bank failure or
excessive tube wear.  For information on pass-bank testing, see the section:
<A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsrep4">Troubleshooting Linear Pass-Banks</A>.
<p>
The same supply runs off 115 VAC and 230 VAC single-phase or three-phase,
depending on what tube is hooked to it and how you configure the input stage.
It's a brute force linear with pass-bank, uses a simple op-amp as the
controller, is not a fancy switcher, and just about anyone could adopt it to
their needs.  Lexel used it to run lasers from 75 mW to 5 watts with only
slight changes such as sticking a buck boost transformer on it or a
three-phase bridge.
<p>
Lexel model 65 and 75 laser tubes require approximately 120 VDC across the
discharge while the model 88 tube requires around 220 VDC.  It might start on
power supply running off of a 115 VAC line, but won't really run on it unless
it is three-phase.
<p>
I guess there is some confusion in Lexel's use of the 88 model designation for
more then one configuration.  Most 2 to 5 watt ion lasers will run off 230 VAC
single-phase at low power, but not 115 VAC.
<p>
The 115 VAC 88D version of the Lexel-88 PSU will drive Lexel Model 65 and 75
tubes from single phase power (our schematics are for the 8A but they are
mostly similar except for the AC line front-end).  The 88D may ignite and
barely run 88 tubes but not drive them to full current.  Three-phase power is
really required for an 88 head and even then I imagine it won't take them all
the way up.  Lexel-88 systems really need 230 VAC power.
<p>
The real common Lexel-88A runs off 230 VAC.  The buck/boost transformer in the
front-end has 5 taps that can be configured as a autotransformer for stepup or
stepdown as much as 40 V, at currents to 25 A continuous.  Selecting the
transformer taps will also aid you in getting the regulator pass-bank to
operate in the correct range (10 to 70 V for the Lexel-88) for a given tube
and is the first thing you check when you fire it up the laser.
<p>
The same transformer also provides a 115 VAC split tap in the primary for the
control relays.
<p>
The majority of the Lexel-88s are the "A" configuration, only a few 'Ds' were
made before an SCR (switchmode) version was released.
<p>
The Lexel-88 PSU has 12 RCA 2N6259 NPN transistors as the pass-bank, and these
are scarce/no longer made. The ECG sub is an ECG388, an inferior transistor
that is stressed badly in this application.  I'm told high grade 2N3055s work
in a pinch, but have yet to try it for fear of popping the whole string.
<p>
It uses a water cooled 1/8th inch copper plate requiring 2.2 gpm of flow
through a 3/8th inch copper tube brazed to the plate.  The plate is 14" x 4"
with one turn of water around the outside, with the 12 transistors and good
cooling, it's rated at 40 amps for 30 seconds at 250V DC, so you should be
able to adapt it to a air cooled heat sink for 10 amp service.  All of the
transistors are isolated from the heat sink with BeO washers.  That's not on
the schematics (Note caution about BeO dust!).
<p>
The Lexel-88 PSU was designed for industrial ion lasers and was used in argon
coagulators, so it has a lot of reserve kick that is not needed.   It can
go all day at 30 amps or idle down at 10 mW and punch up to 5 watts for
sealing off arteries.
<p>
The 6 mH, 50 A choke used as part of the L-C smoothing network is a real back
breaker too, and that's millihenry, not microhenry.
<p>
The PSU gets its low voltages via a string of zeners - who needs a transformer
when you have 250 to 270 DC hanging around.  It uses a good old 2 transistor
multivibrator to drive a doubler to get the -15 V for the op-amp.  Regulation
is a surprising 2% at 25 A in current mode, and not much better in light mode.
Crude but very reliable, and you can diagnose any problem with just an ohm
meter and the diagnostic jacks on the front which give you current, tube drop,
and the amount of reserve voltage the pass-bank is dissipating; you add your
tube drop and the reserve, it should equal the rectified line volts, if not
the regulator is shorted, in which case it will limit itself to about 12 A.

<h4><A NAME="asclx12">Lexel-88 Schematics</A></h4>

The schematics have been redrawn from poor originals of various parts of
several different versions of the Lexel-88.  (I do now have photocopies of
a complete Lexel-88 operation and service manual including schematics so
in principle, any discrepancies could be reconciled but that's not likely
to happen any time soon!)  Although the actual interconnect
wiring is not shown, the relevant signals are labeled with a connector pin
(J or P number) and/or with a signal name indicating origin or destination.
In any case, recreating suitable circuits should be a simple exercise for the
student now that you are familiar with ion laser power supply design! :-)
<p>
The diagrams are available in PDF format.  There are three (3) separate sheets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="88psch.pdf">LEXEL-88-PWR</A> -
  Lexel-88 Power Subsystem.  This includes the AC line front-end, linear
  regulator pass-bank and its driver, filament supply, dual-range meter,
  and relay logic power control.
<p>
<li><A HREF="88csch.pdf">LEXEL-88-CTL</A> -
  Lexel-88 Control Subsystem.  This includes the Current Control and Light
  Regulator printed circuit boards (PCBs) including their low voltage power
  supplies and overcurrent trip circuit.
<p>

  Lexel-88 Laser Head.  This includes the water-cooled argon/krypton ion
  tube, axial electromagnet, igniter, and light sense circuitry.
</ul>
<p>
Note: Due to lack of complete documentation (schematics from different
versions of the Lexel-88 as well as some totally missing pieces), I have
interpolated in some cases and renamed signals to create a more consistent set
of drawings.  So, these will give you the general idea but should not be
thought of as exact schematics of any specific model.
<p>
The basic operation of the each of the major functional blocks are summarized
below.  For a more detailed discussion of the operation of the individual
circuits, see the chapter: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A>.

<h4><A NAME="asclx13">Lexel-88 Power Subsystem</A></h4>

The <A HREF="88psch.gif">Lexel - Power Subsystem</A> consists of of the
single-phase (230 V) AC line front-end and rectifier/filter, regulator
pass-bank and its driver, current sense resistors, filament supply, dual-range
meter, and relay logic power control circuitry.
<p>
The schematics show the Lexel-88 wired for 230 VAC, 40 A input for use with
an Ar/Kr ion tube requiring about 200 VDC across the discharge.  However,
selecting different taps on the buck/boost transformer (part of T2) and/or
rewiring the front-end for 115 VAC input or even modifying it for 240/208 VAC
three-phase would be a simple matter.
<ul>
<li>Power comes in through a 230 VAC, 50 A line connection and is applied to
  the buck/boost and power splitter transformer (T2).  115 VAC power for the
  control relays, filament and control power transformer, and cooling fan is
  obtained from a tap on T2.
<p>
<li>S1 is Power On and is an SPST pushbutton switch.  It activates the Main
  Power relay (K1) and the Hold relay (K6) which keeps power applied unless S2
  (Power Off) is pressed or an overcurrent TRIP signal comes from the Current
  Control PC Card (CPC) energizing K3.  K5 is for remote power on.
<p>
<li>K1 applies power to the control circuitry and filament supply transformer
  (T1).  K5 enables the Laser Start pushbutton switch (S3) after a 30 second
  delay provided by K5.  If the Autostart option (K4) is present, starting is
  attempted for 1 second via K4.  If it is not successful, starting must be
  initiated manually using S3.
<p>
<li>K8 is operated from the cooling water valve power, S4 is the water flow
  sensor and TH1 is the water overtemp switch.  K7 provides an 'interlock ok'
  out signal.  Additional interlocks in the chain include the power supply and
  laser head covers.
<p>
<li>I1 to I6 are neon indicators showing the status at various points in the
  power system:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>I1 is is for main power.
<p>
  <li>I2 and I3 are on opposite legs of the 220 line and will show if either of
    the 40A fuses has blown.
<p>
  <li>I4 will be illuminated if all interlocks are closed.
<p>
  <li>I5 shows system power on.
<p>
  <li>I6 indicates that the laser is being started and/or running.
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Rectifier/filter - This is a high current bridge with an L-C filter.
<p>
WARNING: For these line connected designs with a bridge rectifier, NO part of
the circuit can be tied to earth ground (as is possible with a HeNe supply)
for safety.  Therefore, troubleshooting must be done with extreme care
especially if no isolation transformer is used.  Connecting the ground lead of
a properly grounded scope to any part of the circuit will result in smoke or
worse!
<p>
WARNING: This is even more instantly deadly at 230 VAC!
<ul>
<li>Linear regulator pass-bank - This consists of 12 high power transistors
  and their associated emitter current balancing and current sense resistors
  all mounted on a massive water cooled 'cold-plate'.  Q3-Q14, RCA 2N6259 NPN
  transistors (apparently obsolete) are rated at 800/500 V and 250 WATTS!
  This would be overkill for driving a small air-cooled tube but this power
  supply design is capable of handling 35 AMP jobs!
<p>
<li>Pass-bank driver - A two transistor buffer provides the needed voltage and
  current to the bases of Q1-Q12 and also limits the maximum voltage drop to
  about 60 V to prevent damage to the transistors in the event of a tube fault
  (short circuit or overload condition).
<p>
  WARNING: This and ALL of the associated control circuitry is line-connected!
<p>
<li>Current sense - A set of 12, 2 ohm, 10 W resistors (R7-R18) equalize the
  current through the transistors and generate the sense voltage.  A set of
  12, 150 ohm, 2 W resistors (R19-R30), feed the current sense signal which
  will have a sensitivity of 1 V/6 A.
<p>
<li>Filament supply - A multitap low voltage high current power transformer (T1)
  IS the filament power supply.  The filament tap switch must be set for the
  particular line voltage and tube in use based on precise measurements.
  Proper filament temperature is critical to reliable operation and long tube
  life.
<p>
<li>Dual-range meter - The panel meter, M1, can be selected to read the voltage
  drop across the pass-bank (0-75 V) or the current through it (0-40 A).       
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="asclx14">Lexel-88 Control Subsystem</A></h4>

The <A HREF="88csch.gif">Lexel 88 - Control Subsystem</A> consists of of the Current Control and Light
Regulator PCBs including high (floating) and low side low voltage power
supplies and overcurrent trip circuit.
<p>
The Lexel-88 may operate in either current or light control modes determined
by the setting of the Control Selector switch, S7.
<p>
Current Control PCB:
<ul>
<li>Current Regulator - This uses integral control to set the tube current
  using current feedback only.
<p>
<li>Current trip circuit - An low pass filter (RC) accepts the current error
  signal and sets a discrete flip-flop (Q5, Q6) if current exceeds the set
  limit.  Note that the trip circuit is active in both current and light
  control modes.
<p>
<li>High side low voltage power supply - For the positive voltages, this takes
  a +30 V source (origin unknown!) and a series of dropping resistors, zeners
  and capacitors to produce +20 V and +15 V for the pass-bank control, driver,
  and over current trip circuitry.  A transistor multivibrator running off of
  the +30 V is buffered and used to generate -20 V and -15 V in a similar
  manner.
</ul>
Light Regulator PCB:
<ul>
<li>Light Regulator - This uses integral/proportional type control in its error
  amp.
<p>
  Interestingly, the light sensor in the laser head is on the low side so an
  interface is needed to pass its error/control signal to the main error amp
  which is controlling the pass-bank.  This is accomplished using a PWM chip!
  The error signal controls the duty cycle of a digital pulse train which is
  coupled via an opto-isolator to a simple RC averaging circuit thus providing
  the actual control signal!
<p>
<li>Low side low voltage power supply - This uses zener diodes and capacitors
  to produce +/-15 V for the Light Regulator control circuitry from a 15 V
  (estimated) power transformer winding (origin also unknown!).
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="asclx15">Lexel-88 Laser Head</A></h4>

The <A HREF="88hsch.gif">Lexel-88 laser head</A> includes the water-cooled Ar/Kr ion laser tube and
electromagnet, igniter, and light sense circuitry.
<ul>
<li>Ar/Kr ion laser tube - The Lexel-88 typically uses an external mirror,
  water-cooled tube (see the chapter:
  <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>.  However, an
  internal mirror tube could be used with the same power supply.  Associated
  with it are interlock switches (one shown).
<p>
<li>Axial electromagnet - This coil is connected across the unregulated power
  supply from +HV to -HV (unreg) and provides a magnetic field to concentrate
  the Ar/Kr ion tube discharge.  There is also a regulated electromagnet
  supply option available (not shown).
<p>
<li>Igniter - There was no schematic available but here is a description:
<p>
  (From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
  Lexel starters are a large coil and core series igniter transformer that has
  a relay built into the starter magnetic path.  The relay is initially closed
  by the start signal, passing current through the igniter coil from a 6 uF
  capacitor.  It is then opened by the tube current passing through the
  transformer core and nulling out the magnetic field caused by the relay's 2K
  ohm coil.  Kind of weird.  If you didn't have one to look at you'd never
  believe it works.  A fully magnetic relaxation oscillator. How they ever get
  it balanced is beyond me, there are no adjustments, so somebody was really
  good at transformer core design.
<p>
<li>Light control - A solar (photovoltaic) cell provides a current proportional
  to laser beam intensity.  All processing is performed on the Light Regulator
  PCB.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="asclpsr">Notes on Lexel-88 Power Supply Ratings</A></h4>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The normal pass-bank configuration for the Lexel-88 PSU
is 12 2N6259s.  This is  capable of 30 amps on a 10% duty cycle. Let
me make that clear: "as designed" 10 seconds at 30 amps!  The only
time they get that hot was when the factory would run the tube for 7
seconds at 24 or more amps as a final test.  Only a new healthy tube
could take the strain and your current card would need its resistors
changed to do that.  Running above 25 A gets your transistors into an
region that they are not happy with and continuous at 30 A really strains
the buck/boost transformer.  There were NO factory 15 AMP PSUs, it's
just a label. The Lexel-88 is an OEM laser and thus many supplies were
produced with different labels, most say 10% duty at 30 A. Remember that
the Lexel-88 was designed not as a CW laser, but as a pulsed tube.
When running CW, you have to treat it like a older 85A tube.  If running
with larger tubes, as long as you're in the green region on the meter,
it should be fine.  Your limit is not the transistors but the combination of
your tube voltage and what the buck/boost transformer can do.
Just make sure you always have at least 3 volts on the pass-bank
volts, below that you can loose drive and the pass-bank response gets
sluggish.
<p>
With 12 2N6259s and proper tap settings that supply will do 20 amps unlimited
time.  It's going somewhat above 20 amps that upsets it.

<h2>American Laser 60B Power Supply and Laser Head Wiring and Notes</h2>

(Mostly from: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
If you've seen one 60-series schematic, you've seen them all.  The
one exception is that there are a wide variety of ALC PWM cards.  Some use
4 or 5 733 series op-amps to do the PWM, some use a TL494, and a few others
for larger lasers use a custom 40 pin chip.  Rare versions have the
isolation cards, and quite often the PWM revision is modified on a
per customer basis, but the main chassis and drive card/pass-bank
assembly doesn't change much, if at all.  Of course, the heads can
vary a bit too.
<p>  
The key to understanding most ALC/HGM supplies is the central
zener diode on the PWM card: If the pass-bank gets more then 12 V or in
some cases 14 V, the buck stage cuts in and backs things off.
Otherwise it just happily sits there conducting 100% power.
<p>
FROM OLDER ALC 60B MANUAL: For units with *isolated interface board*:
You have an isolated interface board if there is an extra board in the
PSU with two LM331s and two opto-couplers.  The 60B is a classical ALC supply
with 2 pass transistors and 2 switching "buck" transistors that cut
back on power when the voltage across the pass transistors grows
greater then a level set by a zener diode.

<h2>Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies and Laser Heads</h2>

These designs have been developed with the objective of being relatively easy
to construct using readily available parts.  There are currently complete sets
of drawings for both a pair of 'brute force' power supplies just to test your
tube (but which really shouldn't be used as a permanent solution) and a high
quality linear power supply derived from the Lexel-88 implementation (but with
various enhancements).  Compatible laser head designs are also included for
each one.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Sam's Super Simple(tm) Ar/Kr Ion Laser Test Power Supply (SG-IT1) and
 Sam's Even Simpler Ar/Kr Ion Laser Test Power Supply (SG-IX1/SG-IY1).  These
 are very basic units which may be used for testing of a variety of small
 air-cooled ion tubes or complete laser heads.  However, they lack some
 important features and are therefore not recommended for general use unless
 these are added - as in SG-IL1, below.  However, you can build one of these
 simple power supplies initially and then augment it in the future - which
 what I am doing.
<p>
<li>Sam's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply (SG-IL1).  This design satisfies
 all of the requirements for a basic hobbyist grade power supply using readily
 available inexpensive components.  It uses a linear regulator, logic control,
 and includes the essential electrical, thermal, and safety interlock and
 protection devices.
<p>
<li>Ben's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply (BJ/SG-IL1).  This design is
 derived from SG-IL1 but has simplified control circuitry and a few less bells
 and whistles.
</ul>
<p>
Note: The "Sam's" designs are currently under development so there are no real
guarantees of anything though Ben has successfully built one!!  However, they
should give you the general idea. :-)

<h3>Sam's Super Simple(tm) Ar/Kr Ion Laser Test Power Supply (SG-IT1)
</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascsg10">Introduction to SG-IT1 Schematics</A></h4>

This is about as basic as it gets!  Everything is done manually.  No control
loops, no op-amps - nothing.  Your eyeballs and brain provide the feedback by
watching the current meter like a hawk!  Even the slight line dip from turning
on a lamp elsewhere in the house can affect tube current in a detectable way!
In addition, there are NO safety interlocks or thermal protection devices.
<p>
For these reasons, I would not recommend the use of such a supply for anything
but initial testing and NEVER for unattended continuous operation.  Aside from
safety issues, the lack of a regulator (resulting in unpredictable current
variations and significant ripple) may adversely affect ion tube life unless
run well below its maximum current specification (and thus well below the
laser's maximum possible power output).
<p>
However, it enables something to be constructed reasonably quickly to give you
a taste of what is to come - or to be used for testing of Ar/Kr ion tubes in
unknown condition since there is virtually nothing to fail.  You can short it
out without fear of blowing expensive parts.  Since this is a subset of
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg3">Sam's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply
(SG-IL1)</A>, the addition of regulator and control circuitry in the future is
straightforward.
<ul>
<li>The AC line front end is just a bridge rectifier and C-R-C filter network
  to provides about 130 VDC with reasonably low ripple directly from the 115
  VAC line input.
<p>
<li>The igniter (starter) circuit operates off of an additional low current
  'boost' source to use a higher voltage (which reduces the turns-ratio of its
  high current pulse transformer - a hard to wind part since it must use wire
  rated for both high current (10 A) AND high voltage (10 kV)!  It is similar
  to the design used in the <A HREF="150rcsch.gif">Omnichrome 532 laser
  head</A>.
<p>
<li>The filament supply is a Stancor P6433 'filament transformer' (see, even
  the name matches!) I found at the bottom of my parts cabinet.  It is used
  with a small Variac to adjust filament voltage.
<p>
<li>Current is monitored at all times on a 10 A panel meter in the cathode
  return (constructed from a 10 mA movement across a .1 ohm, 50 W shunt
  with a suitable series calibration resistor).
</ul>
That's all there is to it!  The complex :-) block diagram is shown below
(Variac for filament supply and LARGE Variac for main supply not shown):

</PRE>
Since the power supply is only for initial testing (GOT THAT?!) it does not
have an active regulator.  Tube current control is provided by a large Variac
and/or the heating element from a 1,500 W space heater as a high current high
power ballast resistor.  If the heating element is removed, then adjustments
can be made by changing its resistance by moving a tap and the Variac isn't
essential.  If the space heater is used intact (it just looks kind of funny!),
the Variac will be needed.  (Even if the space heater has multiple switchable
heat settings, this doesn't provide fine enough control.)
<p>
WARNING: Everything is directly line connected.  Great care (even more than
just considering the 1,500 W or so of raw power we are dealing with!) must be
taken in the basic construction, testing, and strict adherence to ALL safety
precautions during testing, use, and troubleshooting.  This even more critical
since there are NO safety interlocks to kill power automatically if the lid is
removed.  See section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsbcs2">SAFETY when Dealing with
Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A> and the document:
<A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered
Equipment</A>.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg11">SG-IT1 Schematics</A></h4>

The diagrams are available in PDF format.  There are two (2) separate sheets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="sgitpsch.pdf">SG-IT1-PWR</A> -
  SG-IT1 Power Unit.  This includes the AC line front-end, tapped ballast
  resistor, boost multiplier, filament supply, and current meter.
<p>
<li><A HREF="sgithsch.pdf">SG-IT1-HEAD</A> -
  SG-IT1 Laser Head. This includes the air-cooled argon ion tube, its fan,
  and igniter.  Of course, if you already have a complete laser head, some or
  all of this circuitry may already be present.  Minor modifications may be
  required to adapt your laser head for testing with SG-IT1.
</ul>
<p>
Components are numbered independently for the SG-IT1 power unit and laser head.
<p>
The ASCII schematics in the descriptions below are basically the same as those
in SG-IT1-PWR and SG-IT1-HEAD but some components not essential for explaining
basic operation may have been left out to simplify the diagrams.  And, there
might an enhancement or two. :-)

Since the intent of this design is to provide something for testing of ion tube
and laser heads, the partitioning of subsystems between the main power supply a
d laser head is only a suggestion.  Your actual arrangement may be dictated by
the design of the actual equipment under test.  For example, modifications may
be needed if the existing igniter in the laser head is not directly compatible
with the outputs of the SG-IT1 as drawn.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg12">SG-IT1 AC Line Front-End</A></h4>

The design described below can serve as the front-end to a linear or switching
regulator, inverter, or to a brute force power supply using only an additional
ballast resistor (for testing only, right?).

This is a simple AC line-connected AC to DC power supply.  Note: Essential

Note: S1, S2, and S3 can be switches or relays.  Logic controlled relays are
highly desirable to enforce the sequencing requirements on the Ar/Kr ion tube
power.  For initial testing, manually operated switches may be used.  Nice
bright indicators for each function are also essential (not shown on the
ASCII schematics) as well as an unswitched one directly across the AC input to
warn that the unit is plugged in!
<ul>
<li>S1 is MAIN POWER and switches both sides of the (115 VAC single phase)
  line.  A magnetic circuit breaker can be used here but it must have both
  poles coupled so both sides trip from an overload on either side (or use a
  single pole breaker only in the Hot line).  S1 also powers the PS and head
  fans.
<p>
<li>S2 is the PREHEAT switch.  It is activated first to bring the Ar/Kr ion
  tube filament up to the proper temperature.  It also slowly charges the main
  filter capacitors, C1 and C2, through D5 and R5 (these part types are
  non-critical - 1N4007 and 330 ohms, 5 W typical, respectively).  This
  eliminates serious inrush current when power is applied to the main bridge.
<p>
<li>S3 is the OPERATE switch.  It is manually activated after the required
  filament preheat delay of 30 to 60 seconds.  S3 applies power to the main
  bridge rectifier/filter and the igniter (boost) voltage multiplier.
<p>
<li>The bridge rectifier, D1, can be a module or be constructed from individual
  diodes.  It must be rated for at least 20 A at 400 V (35 A, 600 V preferred).
  It should be mounted on a heat sink and/or located in the cooling air flow.
<p>
<li>R1 is an inrush limiter, a .1 ohm, 25 W power resistor.  Where the power is
  sequenced using PREHEAT and then OPERATE, R1 is not needed.  However, with
  a test supply, such a precaution is prudent. :-)
<p>
<li>The main filter capacitors, C1 and C2, should be high quality types
  suitable for high current high ripple applications.  
<p>
  Note: Additional small ceramic capacitors should be placed in parallel with
  C1 and C2 to bypass high frequency noise (not shown).
<p>
<li>The dropping/filter resistor, R2, can be a large power resistor or a length
  the salvaged NiChrome element from a space heater wound on a ceramic, mica,
  or other suitable high temperature, non-flammable structure AND provided
  with adequate forced air cooling from the PS cooling fan.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsspl0">Constructing Low Ohm High Power Resistors</A>.
<p>
<li>R3 and R4 are bleeder resistors.  I recommend that these also provide a
  visible indication of capacitor charge.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsspl6">Visual Capacitor Bleeder Circuit</A>.
</ul>
<h4><A NAME="ascsg13">SG-IT1 Ballast Resistor</A></h4>

Current control for SG-IT1 is provided by means of a LARGE Variac on the main
power input and a high wattage ballast resistor in the return (DC-) from the
laser head.  This location permits SG-IT1 to be easily upgraded a regulated
supply (e.g., SG-IL1) by replacing Rb with a regulator pass-bank or chopper.
The only regulation here is via manual adjustment of the value of Rb or the
Variac setting while watching the current meter. :-)

A convenient ballast resistor can be made from the element of a 1,500 W space
heater by providing multiple taps or a clip-on jumper so that lower values of
resistance can be easily selected.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdspl0">Constructing Low Ohm High Power Resistors</A>.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg14">SG-IT1 Filament Supply</A></h4>

A low voltage high current step-down transformer is the easiest way of
providing the 2.5 to 3 at 15 to 25 A required by the Ar/Kr ion tube filament.
<p>
It can be made by modifying the high voltage transformer from a defunct
microwave oven (assuming it died for other reasons - which is very likely).
Remove the high voltage secondary winding (hack it off, whatever) to prevent
the possibility of an unfortunate accident.  Then, determine the voltage of
the existing filament winding and adjust the number of turns to produce just
over 3 VRMS with the connecting cable and filament as a load.  (At these sorts
of current with the non-linear behavior of the filament resistance, a dummy
load really won't be useful.)  Start low and work up by adding turns as
needed.  Finally, add a secure centertap connection.
<p>
I am actually using a Stancor P6433 "Filament Transformer", rated at 5 VRMS
CT at 15 A - probably left over from the vacuum tube days.  While these
specifications are not ideal, it runs my ALC-60X fine without overheating
on a Variac and/or with a suitable length of #14 wire in series with the
filament to drop the voltage to the tube filament.  In fact, the latter is
what I usually use and the voltage dropping wire remains with the laser head
or wiring harness adapter unique to that laser head.
<p>
High quality transformers like this tend to be way over designed.  If you have
a transformer with a current rating slightly less than needed, determine
the resistance of the secondary by putting a known DC current through it and
measuring the voltage drop.  (The resistance should be way too low to
measure accurately on typical DMMs.) If it's around 0.01 ohms or less, then
power dissipation will be only a few watts, which is easily managed
especially if the transformer is in the power supply box with forced-air
cooling.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg15">SG-IT1 Current Meter</A></h4>

This is implemented with a 10 mA FS panel meter and .1 ohm, 50 W shunt as
described in the section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsmmt0">Measurements of
Current and Voltage in Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A>:

</PRE>
Wires from M1 and Rs1 are soldered to the leads of Rs (instead of the other
way around).  That way, it is less likely that a bad connection can result in
the shunt opening - which would fry the meter movement in a very very small
instant!  The 10 mA meter I used (from a pile I had acquired long long ago)
has a measured resistance of 3.5 ohms.  With the addition of R1, the 10 ohm
Calibrate pot (R2) provides fine adjustment of full scale sensitivity.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg16">SG-IT1 Laser Head</A></h4>

The <A HREF="sgithsch.gif">SG-IT1 Laser Head</A> is a intended as a suggestion
and may differ from what you have if you are testing a commercial laser head.
It includes the air-cooled argon laser tube and its HUGE fan(s) and igniter.
This stripped down laser head has no light sense circuitry or interlocks.
The part numbers below refer to the SG-IT1 laser head unless otherwise noted.
<ul>
<li>Argon laser tube (LT1) - This can be a tube like the 60X or Cyonics
  requiring a maximum of 10 A at around 100 VDC (see the chapter:
  <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>).
<p>
<li>Manual Igniter - Pressing S1 generates the starting pulse - keep pressing
  it once a second or so until the tube starts!  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg17">SG-IT1 Igniter</A> for an explanation of how
  it works.  If your laser head already includes a different type of igniter,
  modifications may be needed in the SG-IT1 Power Unit to be compatible.
<p>
<li>Head Fan - A 220 CFM 115 VAC fan runs whenever the MAIN POWER switch (S1
  in the SG-IT1 power unit) is on.  For an existing laser head, it should be
  wired the same way.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg17">SG-IT1 Igniter</A></h4>

This is similar to the igniter from the
<A HREF="532hsch.gif">Omnichrome 532 Laser Head</A> except that a pushbutton
switch is used instead of a unijunction transistor to trigger the SCR.  Like
that design, it is assumed that the boost supply is in the main power unit with
the actual igniter located close to the tube anode in the laser head.  Of
course, if you are testing commercial laser head, it may already have an
igniter so some or all of this circuit may not be needed.  The part numbers
below refer to the SG-IT1 power unit (top) or laser head (below) as indicated.

</PRE>
The igniter pulse transformer is wound on a 2.5 to 3 inch diameter ferrite
core using #14 insulated wire for the primary and secondary.  (The core from a
flyback transformer should also work - remove the gap spacers).  Take care in
winding to distribute the turns uniformly approximately 3/4 of the way around
the toroid making sure that the end of the secondary is at least 1 inch from
the start and any possible conductor.  Position the primary turns near the
starting end (bottom on the diagram) of the secondary.  This will prevent
arcing and allow the use of wire with normal insulation rather than bulky high
voltage wire.

<h3>Sam's Even Simpler Ar/Kr Ion Laser Test Power Supply (SG-IX1/SG-IY1)
</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascsg20">Introduction to SG-IX1 Schematics</A></h4>

OK, so I finally got around to building a version of SG-IT1.  My original
intention was to build SG-IT1 exactly but you know how it is when it is 2 AM
and Radio Shack is closed?  You make do. :-)  (Yes, it is true.  I occasionally
DO buy parts at Radio Shack though not usually for this sort of stuff!)
Anyhow, what this means is that some part values aren't quite the same as those
in SG-IT1, there are some other minor circuit changes, and adjustments
(including the Variacs) were dumped in favor of something fixed.  And, there
are even some enhancements including relay control as well as tube overtemp
and missing fan interlocks. I can never quite resist a bit of creeping
featurism! :-)  OK, so maybe SG-IX1 isn't really even simpler than SG-IT1 in
at least some respects.  However, the differences ARE minor.  They are
summarized in the section: <A HREF=laserasc.htm#ascsg22">Comparison with
SG-IT1 and Construction</A>.
<p>
Like SG-IT1, these power supplies are only recommended for use in testing ion
tubes - not as the permanent power source for your spiffy light show that runs
5 hours a day!  For one thing this may result in reduced ion tube life due to
the lack of regulation.  However, I have heard of people doing just that
without apparent problems.  I expect to augment SG-IX1 with a simple linear
regulator in the future.  The description of this design with schematics is
presented in the section: <A HREf=laserasc.htm#ascsg26">Addition of Current
Regulator (SG-IY1)</A>.  However, even though SG-IY1 has decent regulation,
without light feedback and full safety interlocks, it would still not really
be suitable for general use.  These features are provided by SG-IL1.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg3">Sam's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power
Supply (SG-IL1)</A>.
<p>
A slightly more sophisticated approach using a discrete differential control
amp as shown in <A HREF="argreg1.gif">Simple Linear Regulator</A> would also
be easy to add.  While the stiffness of a supply using this regulator should
be somewhat better than the simple emitter follower of SG-IY1, it does require
a floating +/-15 VDC power supply (not shown) and may be overkill for this
sort of testing application.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdreg2">Typical Linear Regulator Circuit</A> for more
info.  Maybe there will be an SG-IZ1 someday. :)
<p>
SG-IX1/SG-IY1 is compatible with the small air cooled ion laser heads
described in conjunction with the OMNI-150R/532, SG-IT1, and SG-IL1 designs.
However, not having one of those handy :), I built my own head around a
Cyonics ion tube that was given to me 'as-is' (it will fire up with the
proper voltage across the tube and normal current flow but wouldn't lase.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#asccyn">Persuading the Cyonics Tube to
Lase</A> for the exciting outcome).  The Cyonics tube appears to be identical
to the model 2301 shown in the section: <A HREF=laserarg.htm#argbcs5">Photos of
Some Air-Cooled Argon Ion Tubes</A>).  You *will* note that this head is indeed
simpler than any of the others listed above!
<p>
Over the years, I've also used SG-IX1 with a Cyonics/Uniphase 2214-SLB, an
ALC-60X, and a NEC GLG3059H-H (though I don't know precisely what type of
tube is inside of it).  While the tube voltages vary widely - from
110 V down to 80 V, the Low and Medium settings always result in a usable
current, though the High setting was off scale (over 10 A) with the low
voltage NEC head.  Running SG-IX1 on a LARGE Variac permitted any current
from dropout (typically 2 or 3 A) to 10 A to be dialed in for all the lasers.
I like SG-IX1 for testing of lasers in unknown condition because the worst
that would happen if there is a short is to pop the breaker.  There are no
finicky semiconductors which might short out to protect the breaker. :)
<p>
WARNING: Everything is directly line connected.  Great care (even more than
just considering the 1,500 W or so of raw power we are dealing with!) must be
taken in the basic construction, testing, and strict adherence to ALL safety
precautions during testing, use, and troubleshooting.  This even more critical
since there are NO safety interlocks to kill power automatically if the lid is
removed.  See section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsbcs2">SAFETY when Dealing with
Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A> and the document:
<A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered
Equipment</A>.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg21">SG-IX1 Schematics</A></h4>

The diagrams are available in PDF format.  There are two (2) drawing sheets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="sgixpsch.pdf">SG-IX1-PWR</A> -
  SG-IX1 Power Unit.  This includes the AC line front-end, tapped ballast
  resistor, boost multiplier, filament supply, and dual-range meter.
<p>
<li><A HREF="sgixhsch.pdf">SG-IX1-HEAD</A> -
  SG-IX1 Laser Head. This includes the Cyonics air-cooled argon ion tube,
  its fan, igniter, and interlocks.  Of course, if you already have a complete
  laser head, some or all of this circuitry may already be present.  Minor
  modifications may be required to adapt your laser head for testing with
  SG-IX1.
</ul>
<p>
Components are numbered independently for the SG-IX1 power unit and laser head.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg22">Comparison with SG-IT1 and Construction</A></h4>

For the most part, SG-IX1 is the same as SG-IT1 except for the following:
<ul>
<li>No Variacs are used for either the main or filament supplies.  The ballast
 resistor provides enough options to make the main Variac unnecessary (though
 it could always be added).  For the filament supply, (0, 12.6, or 25.2 VRMS
 from the secondary of a small power transformer casn be wired in series with
 the primary to the 5 V filament transformer out-of-phase to drop its output
 voltage if needed.  A primary-side 5 ohm ballast resistor and the 6 foot #14
 AWG wires between the power supply and laser head do the rest.  The resistor
 and wires can easily be altered depending on the particular tube
 requirements. :)
<p>
<li>The main ballast resistor is made from an old hot-plate heating element
 with taps to divide it into 1,1,6,4,2,1 ohms sections.  The first 1 ohm
 resistor is used as the inrush limiter and the next as the 'R' in the CRC
 main filter.  An SPDT center-off toggle switch allows three current levels to
 be selected from the front panel - an enhancement compared with SG-IT1!  For
 example, when wired as shown on the schematic, it provides: Low (3.5 A),
 Medium (5.0 A), and High (7.5 A) into my Cyonics tube (voltage drop of between
 100 and 105 V).  With Rb6 bypassed, the maximum current goes up to 8.5 - which
 is about the limit of the hot-plate heating element as portions of it are
 glowing quite nicely at that point. :)
<p>
 A 100 cpm or thereabouts fan blows directly on the heating element and some
 aluminum flashing acts as a baffle to direct the waste heat up and out of the
 box.
<p>
<li>The ammeter uses just a piece of #14 AWG copper wire for the shunt, trimmed
 until the reading matched may DMM using the +5 from a PC power supply in
 series with a 1 ohm resistor as a current source.  Its length turned out to
 be just about 1 foot.
<p>
 A current limiting resistor and selector switch was added to permit the
 voltage across the tube to be monitored as well.  So, this becomes a dual
 range meter - another feature not present in SG-IT1! :-)
<p>
<li>The 'Boost' multiplier board was built with whatever happened to be
 handy. :)  A 10K resistor was added to its output for short circuit
 protection.
<p>
<li>There have been some minor changes to the arrangement of switches and
 a 20A circuit breaker substituting for the main power switch used in SG-IT1.
<p>
<li>Indicators are provided for Line Live (IL0), Main Power (IL1), Preheat
 (IL2), and Operate (IL3).
<p>
<li>Relays were added for tube filament power (Preheat) and main DC power
 (Operate).  Instead of a toggle switch for Preheat, separate ON/Fil (S1) and
 OFF/Abort (S3) pushbuttons switches are used.  The tube High Temperature limit
 thermal switch (TS1) and fan connector interlocks (part of J3/P3) are wired
 in series with this to kill power in the event of a tube overtemp condition
 or missing fan.  Note that for operator safety, an interlock failure results
 in all power except to the fans to be disabled until the ON/Fil button is
 pressed - thus the system can't start back up on its own.
<p>
<li>Connections to the laser head are via a 8 position barrier terminal strip:
 F1, F2, DC+, BOOST, SW-H, SW-N, INTLK-1, INTLK-2, with the EGND wire attached
 to a stud on the case.  To these I added a short cable with mating 12 position
 AMP Mate-N-Lock connectors so that I could swap heads more easily.  (The
 Filament connections were doubled up to ease current demands on those
 connector pins.)
<p>
 SG-IX1 is now plug compatible with both my home-built laser head using the
 the Cyonics tube (see the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg23">SG-IX1
 Laser Head</A> and my ALC-60X (see the section:
 <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg25">Connecting an ALC-60X Laser Head to
 SG-IX1</A>).  Since setting the filament supply tap for the ALC-60X resulted
 in too much voltage for the Cyonics tube (it uses less current) with the same
 cable length, I added about 10 more feet of #14 wire in series with its
 filament which compensates perfectly. :)
</ul>

Everything is mounted in a really ugly 19 inch rack mountable aluminum cabinet
(interior space is about 16"x10"x5-1/4", WxDxH) that used to be some sort of
more conventional power supply in its former life and it was really easy to put
holes wherever I wanted for mounting components.  After some rework, the box
doesn't really look half bad - in fact it is actually quite nice.
<p>
I used solderless connectors (e.g., AMP crimp lugs) for almost everything.  A
combination of ring/spade types and 'Fast-Ons(tm)' made construction quite
pleasant.  This is certainly much much easier than soldering lots of heavy
gauge wire.  A pair of barrier terminal strips inside provide convenient
junction blocks and allow for the taps to be changed on the tapped ballast
resistor.  Fortunately, I had picked up a professional AMP crimp tool and
1000 lugs (#14-16 AWG size, blue) at a garage sale for $15 a long time ago
always wondering what I would do with them.  I also had a whole bunch of other
types of lugs left over from a certain defunct project at work.  This could
have been done with the inexpensive type of crimp tool/wire stripper sold at
Radio Shack and elsewhere (and that did come in handy for other size lugs) but
the ratchet tool really makes it smooth going - and develops strong hand
muscles as well (but you need to switch hands every so often or they become
unbalanced). :)

<h4><A NAME="ascsg23">SG-IX1 Laser Head</A></h4>

The <A HREF="sgixhsch.gif">SG-IX1 Laser Head</A> is a intended as a suggestion
and may differ from what you have if you are testing a commercial laser head.
It includes the Cyonics air-cooled argon laser tube and its HUGE fan and
igniter.  Like the head for SG-IT1, this stripped down head has no light sense
circuitry or interlocks.  The part numbers below refer to the SG-IX1 laser
head unless otherwise noted.
<ul>
<li>Argon laser tube (LT1) - This is my Cyonics previously semi-working, now
  fully working tube (see above) requiring a maximum of 10 A at around 105 VDC
  (see the chapter: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion
  Lasers</A>).
<p>
<li>Manual Igniter - Pressing S1 generates the starting pulse.  I even did away
  with the SCR - just a pushbutton switch in its place.  For the very easy to
  start Cyonics tube, no more than one press has ever been needed.  However, I
  suspect that for larger or hard-to-start ion tubes, the fancier resonant
  transformer, diode snubbed, supermatic approach used in the other laser heads
  may be required.
<p>
<li>Head Fan - A 220 CFM 115 VAC fan runs whenever the MAIN POWER breaker (CB1)
  is on.  For an existing laser head, it should be wired the same way.
<p>
<li>Interlocks - These include a loop between pins 3 and 4 of the fan connector
  to prevent the power supply from running if the fan is missing or becomes
  disconnected and the Cyonics tube high limit thermal switch (TS1) to provide
  overtemp shutdown.
</ul>
Except for the tube and blocking diode (D1), *everything* was scavenged from
my junk pile and random parts bins.  Therefore, you have no excuse - an ion
laser head is easy to build.  For example:
<ul>
<li>The case is an aluminum 'Minibox', 12"x7"x4" salvaged from a defunct audio
 amp project.  The assorted openings came in handy as the start of the required
 ventilation holes - more were added.
<p>
<li>The igniter is constructed on a piece of blank PCB material left over from
 a project at work.  Its pulse transformer is wound on the core of the dead
 flyback from a Mac Plus computer.
<p>
<li>The fan is from a scrapped DEC BA11K PDP-11 expansion box if you remember
 those. :-)  I had to fashion a plenum out of some roofing flashing to direct
 the air through the tube fin structure (sucking from below).  Simply sitting
 my super fan on top of the box was apparently inadequate - can you believe
 it?!  Without the additional sheet metal, the tube's high limit thermal
 switch was kicking in after a few minutes.  I later added a 1 inch standoff
 similar to what I used on my ALC-60X head - a strip of 1" x 1/16" aluminum,
 20 inches in length, bent into a roughly 6" diameter hoop and covered with a
 piece of a bicycle inner tube. :)
<p>
<li>My parts bins yielded the resistors, capacitors, and the Start switch
 And, most of *these* parts had been salvaged from other equipment!
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg24">Using SG-IX1 with a Cyonics Tube in Home-Built Laser
 Head</A></h4>

During and after construction, the power supply was tested on a Variac via
an isolation transformer.  The final test was done with its outputs shorted
(DC+ to F1) to confirm that the hot-plate ballast resistor could take it and
the dual range meter and current select switch worked as expected.  (The
isolation transformer was temporarily removed for this test since there was no
way it could ever possibly handle the current.)
<p>
After I was happy with the power supply, I built the laser head with its
igniter and made sure that this didn't blow up using the Variac/isolation
transformer setup and multimeter before installing the Cyonics tube.
<p>
With everything powered at normal line voltage (still using my Variac and
isolation transformer), a diffuse pulse of blue-purple light could be seen
from the tube each time the Start button was pressed.  The dual range meter
also showed a corresponding pulse of current and dip in voltage - now this was
very promising.  I didn't expect the tube to light with my 200 W isolation
transformer in place so I would have to remove it!!!
<p>
And then, all h**l broke loose. :)  Actually, what happened was that the main
breaker tripped (CB1) as soon as the Operate switch (S3) was turned on.  Hmmmm.
Since I knew the ballast resistor was correctly connected, the only way
this could happen would be through the filament return to Earth Ground.  Then,
it hit me: I had grounded the can on the tube surrounding the filament to the
case!  Of course, it would arc directly from Ground to the filament since this
was at a high enough potential to break down the gas in the tube - not having
to go through the capillary - and bypassing the ballast resistor!
<p>
Once that 'feature' was removed, the tube fired up instantly and reliably as
far as the discharge was concerned.  I currently have the current select switch
(S4) jumpered for 3.5, 5.0, and 7.5 A.  This works as advertised though the
tube sometimes drops out when changing settings - presumably due to a
momentary dip in voltage.  No problem, a push of the Start button takes care of
that.
<p>
However, as expected, there was no lasing from my semi-broken Cyonics tube at
any current setting.  It was possible that the current wasn't high enough but I
suspected that this wasn't really the problem as I had attempted to get this
tube working with the pulsed supply described in the section:
<A HREF="laseraps.htm#apspit3">Ar/Kr Ion Tube Pulse Test Circuit 3</A> without
success even with a peak current of more than 15 A.
<p>
I assumed this to be either still a result of improper mirror alignment (though
as best I had been able to determine with a HeNe laser alignment jig, I thought
it should have been close enough) or some other as yet undetermined problem
with the tube. So, I built a mirror adjuster out of a 3" long piece of 1/2"
copper tubing (plumbing pipe) which with some reaming, just slips over the
collars on the mirror mounts.  It is WELL INSULATED with multiple layers of
plastic electrical tape (but I still remain clear of it when starting just in
case).
<p>
Using this widget, I tried rocking the mirror mounts while the tube was
powered with SG-IX1 at up to 8 A but still no success.  I figured at the time
that it was possible that leaving the existing collars in place restricted
movement too much but I didn't dare remove them yet as the mirrors at BOTH
ends of the tube would likely be messed up after that!  This tube has severe
cathode sag but the bore is clear - barely -  with the filament just barely
missing it so while its days might be numbered, that in itself should not
affect its ability to lase.  The person who gave me the tube assured me that
the problem would be mirror alignment but I was still not convinced.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg25">Connecting an ALC-60X Laser Head to SG-IX1</A></h4>

Since my Cyonics tube refused to cooperate,  I picked up as 'as-is' ALC-60X
head for $100 to try with SG-IX1.  Apparently, the unit had been sitting
around for a year and when the former owner went to fire it up, the tube
refused to start.  Just the 'tick-tick-tick' of the starter.  (Well, I do
have another 60X tube also in unknown condition so if worse came to worse,
I could substitute that - and it might work.)  In addition, the optics had
been replaced (a single-line 488 nm OC from an ILT-5490 had been substituted
for the original 60X multi-line OC).
<p>
Rather than wait for the proper umbilical cable with that weird AMP connector
to materialize, I decided to wire the 60X directly to SG-IX1.  After all, it IS
only 8 wires: F1, F2, HV+, Boost, and Boost through 100K, the AC H and N to the
fan, and Earth/Safety Ground).  (Originally, the SG-IX1 only had a terminal
strip for connections.  Later I added a 12 pin AMP Mate-N-Lock connector so
that I could easily swap laser heads.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg22">Comparison with SG-IT1 and Construction</A>.)
<ul>
<li>Filament.  Since this wiring must handle 15 to 25 A, I screwed the lugs on
 the end of my filament wires directly to the 60X filament terminals inside
 the head.  I then powered up just the filament to check voltage - 2.5 VAC,
 somewhat low.  The 60X must draw more current than my poor Cyonics!  So, I
 removed half the buck winding in my SG-IX1 filament supply and presto! 2.95
 VAC, perfect.  However, when I went to double check with an analog VOM, I got
 3.5 VAC!  In fact, 2 DMMs are pretty much in agreement on 2.95 VAC and 2 VOMs
 show 3.5 VAC.  I assume this is due to a non-sinusoidal waveform from my
 moderately overloaded filament transformer.  Since at least one of the DMMs
 is true RMS reading - and RMS is what counts for heating - I assume that the
 filament is properly powered.  The color looks right - bright orange, not red
 or yellow.
<p>
<li>Fan. I then added the proper mating connector for the Patriot fan and
 tested it.  With the filament wires routed through the ventilation holes in
 the cover, I could seal up the head for best airflow.
<p>
<li>Anode wiring.  The HV+ lead goes to pin 6 of the umbilical connector,
 Boost to pin 11, and Boost through 100K to pin 17.  I salvaged 3 female pins
 from a disk drive type power connector.  With a bit of squashing, they fit
 snugly.  Actually, it looked like the HV+ male pin on the connector had been
 overheated at some point in the past likely due to less than perfect contact
 but should still be functional.  But, my jerry-rigged connections should be
 better!.  I had to add the 100K resistor externally as SG-IX1 doesn't include
 this resistor.  Can you believe it? :)
</ul>
After some ohmmeter checks to make doubly sure there would be no major
surprises, it was time for the initial smoke test.  I wasn't about to take too
many chances - first power will be via a Variac on an isolation transformer.
If nothing melts down and the tube at least attempts to start (I wouldn't
expect it to sustain a discharge on my 200 W isolation transformer), I'll
remove those insurance items.
<p>
Ready?  Main power, filament power, wait a minute for the filament to get
hot and charge the main filter caps.  HV power!  Wait a few seconds - and -
nothing. :(.  OK, time for the multimeter to see if the igniter is pulsing.
(For this initial test, I don't have the fan/cover assembly installed but even
so, it's hard to determine if there is a tick-tick-tick from the igniter and
of course no way to determine the strength of the start pulses.)
<p>
The voltmeter reveals that while the SCR IS firing about once a second,
somewhat erratically, the voltage across it never exceeds about 200 V likely
due to my somewhat anemic boost supply in SG-IX1 (two of the caps in the
voltage multiplier are much smaller than they should be - well you use what
you have!  For the maunal pushbutton, it didn't matter - waiting longer between
presses was all that waas needed!).  So, I jumpered a 10 uF, 350 V cap across
one of the small ones and guess what?  After powering up again, wait a couple
seconds, and we have ignition!  Well, at least there is some sort of blue glow
inside the tube.  I'm not sure how much current - can't be much with that
whimpy isolation transformer, probably an amp or so at most.  (It shouldn't
even be able to maintain a discharge at very low current.)  But, at least the
tube isn't totally dead.
<p>
The voltage across the SCR is now climbing nicely to 350 to 400 VDC before
firing.
<p>
Time for the REAL test.  So, I remove the isolation transformer and Variac, and
apply power...
<p>
Now the tube won't start. :(  At least not right away.  While pondering the
situation and watching the multimeter (across the SCR) needle bounce around
for a couple of minutes), it suddenly springs to life!  There is a nice bright
diffuse purple glow out of the end of the laser but no lasing - Just like my
poor Cyonics.  I immediately power down (since it's going to be getting hot
mighty fast), install the fan/head cover, power up, and wait another couple of
minutes for it to start again.
<p>
The current select switch on the front panel of SG-IX1 can be set for 3.5, 5.0,
and 7.5 A - no output even at the highest setting.  OK, I am not too surprised
at this.  I had suspected that after the optics had been replaced was when the
head had been tested and found not to work.  Therefore, alignment had not been
performed on the new optics.  Time for a bit of fun of sorts (there are all
sorts of definitions of the term 'fun').
<p>
The long and the short of it is that after realigning the mirrors (several
hours work, start to finish the first time you do it - much of which I could
have avoided if I had only realized that the HR alignment was still likely
perfect!), it's lasing happily at 5.5 and 7.5 A on the 488 nm blue/green line
(single-line optics, remember?).  Power output is not very high - maybe 5 mW
at 7.5 A (eyeballed).  I expect that a serious optics cleaning is in this
60X's future!
<p>
After having run for about an hour, startup is now consistent and reliable on
what would appear to be the first or second pulse from the igniter.  So, all
that stuff about having to run ion tubes to keep them happy seems to be
accurate!
<p>
A summary of the alignment procedure that was used: I first set up a 2 or 3 mW
red HeNe laser so that its beam passed cleanly through the 60X tube's bore.
A piece of white cardboard with a 1/16" hole was positioned so that it just
cleared the HeNe beam.  This aperture would be used as a centering target.  I
then removed the HR and tweaked the OC adjustment nuts for a reflection back
down the bore centered on the HeNe laser's aperture.  I then replaced
the HR, removed the OC, and did the same aiming in from the opposite end of
the tube.  The OC was then replaced and the laser was powered up.  After a
couple of iterations of this, I finally was able to get occasional flashes
when fiddling with the slightly loose OC mirror mount assembly indicating
momentary existence of proper alignment for lasing.  I then gradually
tightened the mirror mounting screws and adjusted the OC-end mirror adjustment
nuts until I could get it lasing continuously.  Finally, power was optimized
(what of it there is) by alternately tweaking the X mirror adjusting nuts and
then the Y mirror axis nuts for maximum brightness.
<p>
Sam's laser alignment rule #5124: Make sure you tighten everything securely.
I had to go back and do this all over again because I lost alignment and
couldn't get it back after accidentally bumping a slightly lose HR mount!
<p>
Apparently, the ILT-5490 OC has a smaller radius (45 cm versus 60 cm for the
normal ALC-60X OC) and alignment is even more difficult because of this (Steve
was surprised or impressed that I could get it to lase at all - Now he tells
me!).  The incorrect optic is also probably at least partially to blame for
the low output power.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atr60xa">ALC-60X Mirror Alignment
Procedure</A> for the gory details - how I recommend doing it as opposed to
how I actually did it the first time!

<h4><A NAME="asccyn">Persuading the Cyonics Tube to Lase</A></h4>

After having aligned the mirrors on my ALC-60X, I could appreciate how precise
the mirror alignment had to be to get any sort of laser beam.  Therefore, I
decided to have another go at the Cyonics tube.  I felt confident that with
a little greater care, I would prevail.  The tube voltage was correct, the
glow from the discharge looked the same as from the 60X - it had to work!
Since none of the other options (hammer, hacksaw, explosives, etc.) would
likely result in a working laser, I didn't have much choice in any case! :)
<p>
For the alignment, rather than just firing my HeNe laser through the bore and
using the external reflection from the closer mirror, I decided to try to get
a reflection all the way down the bore to the HR and back again.  My assumption
was that someone had accidentally wacked only the mirror mount at the HR-end
of the tube in the process of removing the filament connection nuts (which are
located close to the HR mirror mount).
<p>
The basic idea would be similar to part of what is described in the sections
starting with: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atr60xa">ALC-60X Mirror Alignment
Procedure</A> but modified for the Cyonics tube.  I would be dealing mainly
with Steps 1, 3, and 5.  The main problem would be that since the mirrors
on an internal mirror tube like the Cyonics are not removable and it is not
desirable to even move them more than needed to achieve actual alignment, the
strong reflection from the OCs active (inner) surface would be confusing and
completely overwealm the one from the HR at the other end of the tube.  (At
least the outer surface of the OC is AR coated so its reflection should quite
weak.)  As it turned out, these reflections were not really much of a problem.
<p>
After setting things up with the HeNe laser shining clear through the bore,
the reflections back from the nearer OC mirror appeared to be perfectly
centered and entirely swallowed up by the 1 mm or so hole in the HeNe laser's
bezel.  This indicated that the OC was aligned properly thus confirming my
expectations.  However, there was no indication of a reflection from the HR
mirror.  Actually, I didn't quite know what to expect but had a feeling that
whatever it should be, wasn't there!
<p>
So I started working on the HR mount with my plumbing pipe adjuster.  Gentle
radial force didn't produce any change in the reflections back to the HeNe
laser no matter what direction it was applied.  However, a little more force
towards 11 O'clock and I was able to get a strong splotch of reflected light
on the HeNe laser's bezel.  When I let up on the force, the splotch went away.
It wasn't exactly a nice clean round spot but was definitely from the HR and
not from any unavoidable motion of the OC or the entire laser head.  So, I
applied additional force beyond what was needed to get the splotch in the first
place and after a few tries, the splotch remained stable and even somewhat
centered.
<p>
Now for some power!  I didn't expect the tube to yield to my persuasion this
easily so I wasn't surprised when it didn't lase at first.  However, hoping
that it was real close, I used my trusty mirror adjuster once again.  And, in
less than 30 seconds, I was getting hot flashes!  This was so exciting! :)
<p>
Wow, the mount was sure sensitive even to the negligible weight of the little
piece of pipe!  Nearly any radial force resulted in a dramatic change in
output.  A few taps here, a few taps there, and I finally got a stable beam at
close to maximum intensity.  I tried some gentle prodding of the HR-end mirror
mount but that one - thankfully - appeared fairly well aligned as the beam
intensity dropped when force was applied in any direction with approximately
the same sensitivity.
<p>
As expected, this Cyonics tube has 488 nm (green-blue) single line optics
like my ALC-60X.
<p>
Eventually, I will go back and carefully tighten up the 3 set screws on each
mirror mount collar to further stabilize their alignment but for now, this
'dead' Cyonics tube is producing more power than my ALC-60X (but that head
does have an incorrect OC optic) - possibly as much as 10 mW or more at 7.5 A.
The lasing threshold is under 3.5 A with an output of somewhere between 3 and
5 mW at 5.0 A.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg26">Addition of Current Regulator (SG-IY1)</A></h4>

Having played with SG-IX1 for awhile, I decided to design a super simple
linear current regulator to replace part of the ballast resistor and provide
continuously adjustable current to the ion tube.  I didn't want to bother
with separate low voltage power supplies, op-amps, or loop equations.  The
result is a basic regulator using a linear pass-bank of 6 2N3055 NPN power
transistors driven by an adjustable voltage source derived from the main DC+
rail.  This isn't quite as precise as one using fancy control loops with
integral/differential system equations but should still have much lower ripple
and much better line/load regulation than the brute-force hot-plate supply.
<p>
Tube current is adjustable from about 0 A (or as low as the tube will sustain a
discharge) to 10 A (though I probably wouldn't want to leave it at more than
about 8 A continously).
<p>
I expect to transform SG-IX1 into SG-IY1 once I scrounge up the rest of the
additional parts!
<p>
Note that SG-IY1 still does not have any provision for light control - which
is essential for maximizing tube life (at least for some laser heads wich are
prone to plasma oscillations).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argmlh0">Tips for Maximizing Ion Laser Tube Life</A>.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg27">SG-IY1 Schematics</A></h4>

The diagram is available in PDF format.  There is only one (1) drawing sheet:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="sgiypsch.pdf">SG-IY1-PWR</A> -
  SG-IY1 Power Unit.  This includes the AC line front-end, shortened
  tapped ballast resistor, boost multiplier, filament supply, linear pass-bank,
  and triple-range meter.
</ul>
<p>
Being a simple addition to SG-IX1, the same laser heads can be used.
<p>
As you might expect, most of the diagram is the same as SG-IX1 (though slightly
rearranged to fit everything on the single sheet - one of the other important
requirements of this design!).  A few of the changes include:
<ul>
<li>The linear pass-bank is driven by an adjustable voltage source and is in
 essence an emitter-follower which maintains a constant voltage (and thus
 constant current) across the 1 ohm emitter resistors (R15 through R20, whose
 function is to balance the current among Q3 to Q8) and common resistor (R21).
<p>
<li>The Triple-Range Meter allows the voltage drop across the pass-bank to
 be monitored in addition to the tube voltage and current.
<p>
<li>The tapped ballast resistor has been simplified and, in conjunction with
 the existing Current Select switch (S4) can be used to adjust the voltage
 drop across the pass-bank depending on the actual tube current setting.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg28">Experience with SG-IY1 on a New Uniphase Head</A></h4>

(From: Jon Caywood (sarlock@twcny.rr.com).)
<p>
Your power supply design, SG-IY1, seems to function very well from what I can
determine.   I have just recently finished some runs with an ammeter and
voltmeter on a brand new 2214-40MLAM Uniphase head and I am very pleased
with the results.
<p>
I used your schematic but removed two features I did not really need.  The
first was the igniter multiplier, and the second was the 3-way meter.  I am
building a module that will sit in-line with the laser head and tell me the
power supply current and voltage if I need this.  This helps reduce the size
of the supply a bit, which is good as I am trying to keep equipment down to
minimal bulk.
<p>
Using this power supply, I ran the head at a few different settings.  I do
not have a power meter, so I can not report on optical power.  However here
are the tube voltage/current readings:
<p>
<PRE>
         Tube Current (A) ->    3      5      8     11
 --------------------------------------------------------
   Initial Tube Voltage (V)    101.5  104    109    114
   After 5 Minutes at 5 A (V)  104    106    111    115
</PRE>
<p>
I do not normally run this head at 11 amps, but it was all right for a quick
test.  I am finding, however, that I either need a larger heatsink, or I
need bigger fans for my current heatsink on the pass-bank. The heatsink I am
using now is fairly large as it is.

<h3>Sam's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply (SG-IL1)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascsg30">Introduction to SG-IL1 Schematics</A></h4>

The design presented here is reasonably simple but should safely and reliably
drive small air-cooled Ar/Kr tubes requiring up to 10 A at 100 V.  I took
features from both the Omnichrome-150R and Lexel-88 power supplies and added
some bells and whistles of my own including a CMOS logic controller and
indicators on all interlocks.  The result should be a system which can be
constructed with mostly common inexpensive parts but with more than enough
sophistication to put those older designs to shame. :-)
<p>
CAUTION: SG-IL1 has not yet been built so treat it as a 'Works-in-Progress'.
In other words, I will not be responsible should the universe collapse into a
singularity upon powering up a system based directly on these diagrams!

The basic operation of the each of the major functional blocks are summarized
below.  For a more detailed discussion of the operation of the individual
circuits, see the chapter: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power
Supplies</A>.

<h4><A NAME="ascsg33">SG-IL1 Power Unit</A></h4>

The <A HREF="sgilpsch.gif">SG-IL1 - Power Unit</A> consists of of the (115 V)
AC line front-end and rectifier/filter, regulator regulator pass-bank and its
driver, current sense resistors, filament supply, dual-range meter, and low
voltage power supplies.
<ul>
<li>CB1 is a two pole ganged 15 amp breaker and switches all power to the unit.
<p>
<li>Rectifier/Filter - A 400 V, 35 A bridge rectifier feeds a C-R-C pi-section
  filter as discussed in the section:
  <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apspsc1">Single-Phase 115 VAC Front-End</A>.  At
  maximum rated load (10 A), R1 (2 ohms) will drop about 20 V reducing the
  the disspation in the regulator pass-bank substantially (of course, R1
  needs to be rated at 250W!).  With a pair of 3,000 uF low ESR computer
  grade capacitors for C1 and C2, the maximum ripple should be under 15 V
  allowing adequate headroom for the regulator.
<p>
<li>K1 is the PREHEAT relay.  It is activated by the Preheat Timer to bring
  the ion tube filament up to the proper temperature.  It also slowly
  charges C1 and C2, through D2 and R2.  This eliminates serious inrush
  current when K2 enables power to the main bridge.
<p>
<li>K2 is activated to power the main bridge after the PREHEAT delay.
<p>
  K2 also enables the power supply fan and the igniter circuitry.  (The fan
  in the laser head runs as long as CB1 is in the ON position.)
<p>
<li>R2 is a safety bleeder resistor to discharge C1 and C2 in a relatively
  short time once power is removed.  The value of 5K results in a time
  constant of about 30 seconds - which isn't *that* short.  Use a discharge
  tool like a 40 W light bulb with well insulated probes if you are impatient!
</ul>
<p>
WARNING: For these line connected designs with a bridge rectifier, NO part of
the circuit can be tied to earth ground (as is possible with a HeNe supply)
for safety.  Therefore, troubleshooting must be done with extreme care
especially if no isolation transformer is used.  Connecting the ground lead of
a properly grounded scope to any part of the circuit will result in smoke or
worse!
<ul>
<li>Linear regulator pass-bank - This consists of 6, 2N3055 power transistors
  and their associated emitter current balancing and current sense resistors
  all mounted on large finned aluminum heat sink.  Don't skimp on the cooling
  as the pass-bank needs to dissipate a total of about 200 W with 10 A through
  the tube!
<p>
<li>Pass-bank driver - A two transistor buffer provides the needed voltage and
  current to the bases of Q1-Q6 and also limits the maximum voltage drop to
  about 60 V to prevent damage to the transistors in the event of a tube fault
  (short circuit or overload condition).
<p>
  WARNING: This and ALL of the associated control circuitry is line-connected!
<p>
<li>Current sense - A set of 12, 2 ohm, 10 W resistors (R1-R6) equalize the
  current through the transistors and generate the sense voltage.  A set of
  12, 150 ohm, 2 W resistors (R7-R12), feed the current sense signal which
  will have a sensitivity of 1 V/3 A.
<p>
<li>Boost multiplier - A voltage quadrupler powered when K2 closes (Operate or
  Standby) generates 400 to 500 VDC for use by the igniter in the laser head.
  Its output is effectively shorted out (disabled) once the tube starts.
<p>
<li>Filament supply - A small (1 A) Variac powers a Stancor P6433 Filament
  Transformer.  The actual setting must be determined for particular line
  voltage and tube in use based on precise measurements.  Proper filament
  temperature is critical to reliable operation and long tube life.  I would
  recommend that once this is determined, a mechanical stop be installed on
  the Variac to prevent an, um, 'accident'!
<p>
<li>Dual-range meter - The panel meter, M1, can be selected to read the voltage
  drop across the pass-bank (0-75 V) or the current through it (0-15 A).       
<p>
<li>Low voltage power supplies for the analog control circuitry and power relays
  (+/-12 VDC) and for the CMOS logic (+5 VDC) are of standard design using
  fixed voltage IC regulators (7812, 7912, 7805).
<p>
<li>Power Supply Fan - A 100 CFM 115 VAC fan runs at full speed when the laser
  is on and at reduced speed after shutdown if the temperature inside the
  power supply case is excessive.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg34">SG-IL1 Control and Interlocks</A></h4>

The <A HREF="sgilcsch.gif">SG-IL1 - Control and Interlocks</A> subsystem
consists of of the main control amplifier, Standby reference and current level
network, light control amplifier, overcurrent trip, and interlock circuitry.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Main control amplifier - The is op-amp (U1A) uses proportional/integral
  control to adjust tube current based on feedback from the pass-bank current
  sense signal (CS) the standby reference, current level (front panel
  control), and light control amplifier signals on a strongest-wins basis.
  Zener diode ZD1 limits the intermediate drive signal to 10 V and the current
  limit control can be set for a corresponding maximum current of 6 to 12 A.
  U1B buffers the drive signal and the RCR network (R5,C2,R4) provides some
  additional low pass filtering in the loop response.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Current Sense (CS): 0 to 4 V corresponds to 0 to 12 A.
<p>
  <li>Pass-Bank Drive (PBD): 2 to 6 V results in a current of roughly 0 to
    12 A.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Standby reference - This sets the Standby tube current.  Running in Standby
  mode disables the front panel current and light level controls by forcing
  their respective signals to the main control amplifier to 0.  The standby
  level (internal pot) sets the tube current in Standby mode and the minimum
  tube current when in Operate mode (e.g., if the current and light level
  front panel controls are all the way down).
<p>
<ul>
<li>Standby current may be set between 0, and about 3 to 6 A (maximum depends
    on setting of current limit control).
<p>
<li>Q1 and Q2 disable the current and light control feedback loops when in
    Standby mode.  A small DPST relay and appropriate relay driver may be
    substituted for the MOSFETs if desired.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Current feedback - In Operate mode, the front panel current level control
  determines tube current if its setting is higher than the Standby current
  and the light level control.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Current level may be set between 0, and 8 to 12 A (maximum depends on
    setting of current limit control).
</ul>
<p>
<li>Light feedback - This consists of the integrator (U1C) and includes both
  DC and AC control.  In Operate mode, the front panel light level control
  determines tube current based on light feedback where its setting would call
  for a higher current than both the standby and current level front panel
  controls.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Light Sense (LS): Sensitivity is 5 V for maximum setting of front panel
    light level control.
</ul>
<p>
  AC light feedback is provided to reduce optical noise and minimize/suppress
  plasma oscillations.  Sensitivity is set with the internal noise pot.
<p>
<li>Overcurrent Trip - An RC filter followed by a diode peak detector feeds
  the voltage comparator (U2A) to produce a low going logic signal (OVERCUR-L)
  should the tube current exceed the set-point (should be about 12 A) for an
  extended period of time.  This could indicate a fault (short circuit) in
  the tube or wiring or a failure of the regulator.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Trip sensitivity: May be set between approximately 2 and 14 A.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Modulation input (not shown) - There are a number of ways of adding this
 capability to SG-IL1.  For low frequency power control, a signal can be
 introduced to the summing node of the Light Control Amplifier (IC1, pin 9),
 via a suitable resistor network to adjust gain.  When operating with light
 feedback, this would allow an external signal to control output power within
 the range of tube current between the settings of the Standby and Current
 Limit pots.  Alternatives include going directly into the Main Control
 Amplifier (but no current limits except overcurrent shutdown) or adding a
 non-inverting stage between the output of the diode OR network and the
 Current Limit pot.  In all cases, interaction with the AC Noise circuit must
 be considered to maintain stability.
<p>
 These changes are left as an exercise for the student.  Note that since
 turning the beam totally off isn't likely to be possible with any internal
 modulation scheme, a separate AOM (Acousto Optic Modulator) will probably be
 required for laser light show, laser TV, or other image/graphics generation
 applications.
<p>
<li>Interlock Relay - K3 receives its power through the interlock chain.  It
  provides power for the Preheat and Main relays (K1 and K2) so that if any
  interlock is open, these relays will be disabled.
<p>
<li>Interlock Chain - consists of the keyswitch (S1), PS and head cover
  switches (IS1 and IS2), head fan interlock (part of P5/J5), and PS and head
  thermal protectors (TS1 and TS3).  Interlock Indicators (II1 to II4)
  identify the specific interlock causing a no-start/abort condition.
<p>
<li>Interlock Indicator Circuit - Each of these is a constant current LED
  driver designed so that if any or all of the interlock/protectors are open,
  the location will be identified.  This same circuit is also used for the PS
  and Head fans to indicate that they are running at reduced speed after the
  tube has been shut off if the power supply or laser head is still warm.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg35">SG-IL1 Digital Board</A></h4>

Sequencing for this power supply is implemented with discrete CMOS/HCMOS logic
devices.  Other common logic families (like LS TTL) could be used instead with
minimal redesign.  Since speed is not an issue (for once!), the main design
issues for such a substitution would be logic level compatibility and drive.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Preheat and Blink Timer - A CD4040 12 bit counter is used to provide the
  preheat delay and the 1 and 2 Hz blink clocks (BLNK1-P and BLNK2-P).  A
  buffered 60 Hz signal from the low voltage power supply is the master clock.
  The timer is enabled by pressing the PREHEAT switch iff all the interlocks
  are closed and the FAULT FF (U4B) is clear.  It pulls in the Preheat relay
  (K1) to power the tube filament and precharge the main filter capacitor
  bank.  FILHOT-H goes active after 2048 pulses from the power line, about 35
  seconds.
<p>
<li>Mode Selection Logic - The Preheat Req, Standby Req, and Operate Req
  flip-flops determine the major system modes.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Idle - All FFs reset.  This is the default mode upon power-up and will be
    entered when the RESET button (S4) is pressed.  The IDLE LED (IL1) will be
    lit in this state.
<p>
  <li>Preheat - Pressing the PREHEAT button (S1) sets the Preheat Req FF iff all
    the interlocks are closed and the FAULT FF (U4B) is clear.  This enables
    the 35 second preheat delay.  The PREHEAT LED (IL2) will be blinking at
    a 1 second rate while the filament is heating.  Pressing the PREHEAT
    button again will cancel Standby or Operate if they had been requested or
    entered.
<p>
  <li>Standby - Pressing the STANDBY button (S2) sets the Standby Req FF (and
    Preheat Req FF if it hadn't already been set) iff all the interlocks are
    closed and the FAULT FF (U4B) is clear.  Once the preheat delay has been
    completed (if FILHOT-H wasn't already set), the system enters Standby
    mode closing K2 (PO-L) and starting the laser tube.  If waiting for the
    preheat delay to expire, the Standby LED will blink at a 2 Hz rate.  Once
    Standby mode is entered, the Standby LED will be on solid.
<p>
  <li>Operate - Pressing the OPERATE button (S3) sets the Operate Req FF (and
    Preheat Req FF if it hadn't already been set) iff all the interlocks are
    closed and the FAULT FF (U4B) is clear.  Once the preheat delay has been
    completed (if FILHOT-H wasn't already set), the system enters Operate
    mode closing K2, starting the laser tube, and enabling the Current Control
    and Light Control feedback loops.  If waiting for the preheat delay to
    expire, the Operate LED will blink at a 2 Hz rate.  Once Operate mode is
    entered, the Operate LED will be on solid
</ul>
<p>
<li>Fault FF (U4B) - Any unsafe condition with respect to the interlocks chain
  or a prolonged tube overcurrent will set the Fault FF.  This will disable
  or shutdown all power to the tube but will leave the mode indicators and
  interlock indicators ON so that the cause of the fault condition can be
  determined.  Power cycling or pressing the RESET button is the only way to
  clear the Fault FF and return to the Idle state.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg36">SG-IL1 Laser Head</A></h4>

The <A HREF="sgilhsch.gif">SG-IL1 Laser Head</A> includes the air-cooled argon
laser tube and its HUGE fan(s), igniter, light sense circuitry, and test jacks.
The part numbers below refer to the SG-IL1 laser head unless otherwise noted.
<ul>
<li>Argon laser tube (LT1) - This can be a tube like the 60X or Cyonics
  requiring a maximum of 10 A at around 100 VDC (see the chapter:
  <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>).  Associated with
  the tube are the case and fan interlock, cooling fan, thermal protector, and
  the light sensor.
<p>
<li>Igniter - A repeating pulse generator is enabled when power is applied to
  the tube and continues operating until the tube starts.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascsg37">SG-IL1 Igniter</A> for an explanation of how
  it works.
<p>
<li>Light Sense Preamp - A solar (photovoltaic) cell provides a current
  proportional to laser beam intensity.  The preamp is in the 532 laser head
  and includes a sensitivity adjustment (R13).  The Beam-On output is active
  when a minimal light intensity is detected from the laser.
<p>
<li>Head Fan - A 220 CFM 115 VAC fan runs at full speed when the tube is
  powered and at reduced speed after shutdown if the temperature inside the
  laser head is excessive.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ascsg37">SG-IL1 Igniter</h4>

This is similar to the igniter from the <A HREF="532hsch.gif">Omnichrome 532
Laser Head</A> except that a neon lamp is used instead of a unijunction
transistor to generate the repeating pulse trigger to the SCR.  Like that
design, it is assumed that the boost supply is in the main power unit with the
actual igniter located close to the tube anode in the laser head.  The part
numbers below refer to the SG-IL1 laser head unless otherwise noted.
<p>
The boost supply powers both a relaxation oscillator consisting of a neon
bulb, DL1, R4, R5, and C5, and the igniter storage capacitor, C6.  Pulses are
generated several times a second until the tube starts.  The igniter
transformer, T1, is wound on a 2.5" x 3.0" ferrite core from an old flyback
(with the core gap spacers removed) and has a 2 turn primary and 40 turn
secondary using #14 wire.  SCR1 discharges the igniter storage capacitor,
C6, into the primary of T1 resulting in an 8 to 10 kV starting pulse.  The
snubber components (D2 and R7) and tuning capacitor (C7) assure maximum
output pulse amplitude with minimal undershoot (which could just as easily
shut off the tube as start it up!).

<h3>Ben's Linear Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply (BJ/SG-IL1)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascbj10">Someone Actually Built This Thing!</A></h4>

This design is based on SG-IL1 but with modifications to the logic board.
It runs off of a 2:1 high current stepdown transformer on the 240 VAC line.
<p>
(From: Ben (macgyver@ihug.com.au).)
<p>
Well, at about 8 PM tonight I pressed the operate button on my BJ/SGIL1 for
the first time. After extensive testing before hand (dry runs with no tube
connected), setting up the control currents and trip outs, and heavily
modifying the digital control logic (completely different and simpler than the
design you have suggested), the tube sprang to life and the supply is coping
quite nicely.
<p>
I think I scared the absolute F*** out of my house-mate when he walked into
the room while I was doing a low level beam effect (the sheet of light effect)
with the power cranked most of the way up and no lights on. We fiddled with
the laser for about 4 hours flat out, making vertical scans - the beam moving
up and down rapidly and scanning from side to side slowly, and even conjured
up a small beam shutter to cut off the beam at certain intervals. All these
effects are generated by 4 pots and 5 switches. Obviously, one set for
horizontal, and one for vertical, and the 5th switch being the manual beam
shutter.
<p>
All I can say is most of SGIL1 works OK (maybe all of it does, but I couldn't
get the logic board working).  My design uses a 555 (running at 2 Hz) clocking
2 CD4017 decade counters to generate the 1 and 2 HZ blink clocks and the 40
second preheat delay.  The 8th output on the second one disables the 555.
<p>
Opening any interlock kills power to the drive relays as usual, but it also
resets the 4017's so that when prehest is pressed again (or all interlocks are
reset), the standby and operate controls won't function until the preheat
delay expires.
<p>
I have added a beep for every button-press and a new display. Instead of
having just a preheat led, a circle of leds (five 3 mm units) bisected by a
pair of vertically mounted 5mmx2mm rectangular leds provide a standby/operate
indicator. It lights up red with the rectangular leds red when preheating the
filament, and turns green when the filament is warm; and the rectangular leds
go out.
<p>
Case heat isn't a problem, the 240 VAC fan is rated at 150 CFM and cools the
pass-bank and the 200 W, 2 ohm resistor I just happened across at an
electronics junk yard. I expect this resistor to handle the heat OK as it is
mounted on a gigantic heatsink from a 2 kW inverter. I'd say it's about a 3.3
&deg;C/Watt heatsink.
<p>
It's running as we speak at half power at home. I trust my house-mate to keep
an eye on it - burning in the tube as it hasn't been fired in about a year.
I asked him to run it till he goes to bed. He doesn't mind the space heater
effect.  I just spent most of my money on a bloody laser, but it is a LOT of
fun :) :).
<p>
(Two months later)
<p>
Well, here we go - I have made a few modifications to the supply, and
drastically changed the front panel layout (thank god for 19" rack cases
with replaceable panels!
<p>
The preheat/blink timer now consists of a 556 timer and few other components.
This all fits onto a board the size of a large DPDT mains switching relay.  I
actually used a cable tie base and cable tie to stick it to the side of the
control relay.  All my control logic is now done by relays and switches.  Less
chips in the thing means less things that can blow up :).)

The rear panel consists of an 8 way DIN socket for the interlocks, a 30 A
Speakon socket for the head supplies (3 cores of 20 amp lighting cable) and an
IEC female chassis socket for the 240 VAC fan on the head.  All 3 lengths of
wire were cable tied together about every 30 cm along the cable and wrapped in
black insulation tape (to make it kind of neat and tidy). I decided not to put
indicators on all the interlocks - if one goes out, use of ones grey matter
should work out where the problem lies. The meter is a Dick Smith LCD panel
meter. Looks kind of nifty with 2 decimal places for the tube current, and the
blue backlighting looks quite good too (blue leds behind it)
<p>
I am dying to get a camera and takes some photos of this thing to show you the
real thing rather than ASCII renditions. I can easily access a scanner, but
may have to buy a disposable camera.  Oh well :).
<p>
I also have some circuits on the way for light shows:
<ul>
<li>Circuit 1 is of an automatic laser light show based on lissujous patterns
 using 3 motorized mirrors, one of which can be reversed, and one which can be
 stopped. Patterns change every 5 to 60 seconds and include stars, circles,
 multiple flowers, etc.
<p>
<li>Circuit 2 is a sound to laser converter, using the bass frequencies for
 the horizontal, and treble frequencies for the vertical. If a sawtooth is
 applied to the horizontal input and the audio to the vertical, a low
 resolution laser oscilloscope can be made.
</ul>
I should have those schematics within about a month and I will get them
scanned in for you. Unfortunately, we're just waiting on that camera.
<p>
Now I wonder how I can get rid of that damn annoying 12 second delay on the
start board of the NEC-3030 head?  I don't want to probe around it, specially
when it's trying to start.  Wouldn't mind a schematic for it :(.
<p>
BTW, you need to increase your bleeder resistor on the main supply caps to
about 9 or 10 K as the 5K, 7 W tends to get a little too hot.  Either that or
up its wattage - I am using a pair of 4.7K 5 W resistors and they bleed off the
charge in about 60 seconds - takes about that long to get the 8 lid screws
out :).

<h4><A NAME="ascbj11">Failure of the NEC-3030 Laser Head</A></h4>

Unfortunately, since the description above was provided, the NEC-3030 laser
head which the power supply was driving appears to have died and will not start
from either Ben's version of SG-IL1, his brute force 'heater' supply, or a
commercial ion laser exciter.  While all indications are that this was a
natural death (it WAS a high mileage tube), some peculiar behavior of the
power supply cannot be ruled out as the cause.  Therefore, anyone constructing
SGIL-1 or any other home-built power supply as well as using a commercial unit
in unknown condition should make double sure that its output current is
controllable, limited to a safe value for the laser head, and stable.
<p>
(Quoted text from: Ben (macgyver@ihug.com.au).) 
<blockquote> 
 "****PANIC****  ****PANIC****  ****PANIC****  ****PANIC****  ****PANIC****
<p>
 I am supposed to do a light show tomorrow night and I think my laser has
 died.  The heaters come on and glow brightly, and the system is getting
 ignite pulses.  There is a flash of plasma every second or so, 3 dim ones,
 then a bright one, but the tube fails to start.  What would cause this?  I
 have checked the regulator on a dummy load and that's working fine, as are the
 caps and front-end bits and pieces.  I need to have this thing back up and
 running tomorrow! :(
<p>
 I don't like the thought of brute starting it with a Oudin coil (and I don't
 possess one anyway - about the only thing that I have that comes close is a
 solid state Tesla coil, a design using a TV flyback.)"
</blockquote>
<p>
Was it working and quit or did it just not start?  It still sounds like a power
supply problem - does the current control have any effect on the duration or
brightness of the pulse?  Can you try it on your brute force supply?  Do you
have a scope to look at waveforms (careful - non-isolated circuitry!)
<blockquote> 
 "It was working 5 hours ago and went to start it up again about 2 hours ago
 and it wouldn't go.
<p>
 It doesn't matter where I set the current control, it just flashes. It seems
 as though the igniter is in good condition.  Could it be a dead filter cap in
 the supply?  I don't really have a means of testing large value caps. What is
 the usual cause of this problem?  I have tried to let it run for 15 minutes
 trying to start but no change. I am worried i might do damage to the head or
 supply trying to start it."
</blockquote>
It could be a bad cap - or a lot of other things.
<p>
You could try bypassing the regulator with a suitable power resistor to limit
current to 10 A at 100 V on the tube and see if it will run unregulated, thus
confirming a problem in the supply. but do this with caution!
<blockquote> 
"It looks like I have done all this work only to have my laser die after less
 than 5 hours of operation. The tube won't start even with my old test supply
 (7 ohm resistor, 4700uf cap and transformer borrowed from BJ/SGIL-1 :(."
</blockquote> 
I hope these problems don't discourage you too much.  I have had my share
of disasters (you can read about them in the FAQ though you have to hunt for
them - I don't make them *that* easy to find!).  I rationalize them as learning
experiences though in this case we don't yet know if the cause, assuming the
tube really is dead, was within your/our control or was just due to old age.
<p>
<blockquote> 
 "It looks like I can get my hands on a 20 mW Uniphase or Spectra-Physics head
 for $250, and a matching supply for $750 - heads are definitely cheaper than
 the supplies!  This is from:
 <A HREF="http://www.hb-laser.com/">HB-Laserkomponenten</A> in Germany."
</blockquote> 
<p>
Those prices still sound high.
<p>
And, if it was something to do with the power supply, then this needs to be
determined before you attach another tube.
<blockquote>
"It's really weird though - the tube is capable of generating a plasma, but
 can't sustain it. Everything about the tube is fine from my point of
 view - the cathode lights up, there are igniter pulses."
</blockquote>
Does it generate a beam for those instants when it flashes?
<blockquote>
 "Yes.  And, we have just confirmed that the tube IS the problem.  Mark (a
 friend of mine who has access to all kinds of gadgets, has turned up with a
 Spectra-Physics exciter and we coupled it to the head - same problem.  Two
 very sad looking faces here. I will admit that the tube was a high mileage
 job, and could have gone any time.  Pity - now i have a home-built supply and
 no laser to use with it.
<p>
 Well, it's been fun - I'm going to get another head, and a commercial
 exciter from Mark - He's gonna give me the head and all I have to pay for is
 the exciter - $500 - for an exciter and a 300 mW head - not bad eh? :)
<p>
 I will keep in touch and let you know when it arrives. I am going to put my
 test supply up for sale to partially fund the new laser, but I will keep my
 SG-IL1 as a reminder - and as a spare supply should the commercial unit die
 catastrophically.
<p>
 Sad outcome in some respects, but it wasn't the fault of your circuits - There
 will be a happy ending to this saga :).
<p>
 Keep me posted of any updates you make to the laserfaq, as I enjoy reading
 it immensely - I probably visit about 10 times a week if not more :)."
</blockquote>
Well, I wish you the best of luck and watch those eyeballs - 300 mW is a LOT
of laser light. :-)
<p>
You are the first person I know of to do something serious from the ion laser
portion of the FAQ.  It is always being updated so you will just have
check frequently.   Unfortunately, I cannot document every small change or
addition though major events will show up on the <A HREF="lasersam.htm">Sam's
Laser FAQ Welcome Page</A>.
<blockquote>
"Mark has brought round the 60X head and has been very brave and hooked it up
 to the BJ/SGIL1.  It works fine and we have been watching the current on a
 clamp meter for the past hour, and it's been fine. Looks like I just had a
 bad head (or a very elderly one in hours usage terms).  Mind you, my head had
 many, many hours use on an unregulated supply until I found out that it needed
 regulation, and that's probably what killed it.  Learning experience I think.
<p>
 I will definitely watch the old eyeballs - 300mw seems a zillion times
 brighter than the 3030 (the 60X is so bright that I can't look at the output
 on the wall!).  It's doing this at only about 7 amps."
</blockquote>
The only other test to perform to be doubly sure that it wasn't the power
supply at fault would be to get a scope (or true AC ammeter with a high enough
frequency response - say at least a kHz) and make sure there are no high
amplitude oscillations in the tube current at any setting due to inadequate
damping in the feedback loop.  Since the panel meter only measures average
current, these might not show up in the reading if they are at more than a few
Hz or in flickering beam brightness if they are at more than 50 Hz or so.
However, the peaks could still be too high for the tube.  If this is not
happening and the there are no intermittents resulting in excessive current
at random times, it must have been that the head just dies on its own.
<p>
WARNING: Where the power supply is line-connected (without isolation), this
measurement would have to be done differentially across the sense resistor if
the scope or meter has its case tied to ground.  See the section:
<A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsmmt0">Measurements of Current and Voltage in Ar/Kr
Ion Laser Power Supplies</A>
<p>
We may never know exactly what went wrong.  From the section:
<A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrctt2a">Problems with NEC Argon Ion Tubes</A>, it is
apparent that these laser heads sometimes fail to start due to no external
cause - and can be resuscitated using an Oudin Coil.
<p>
<blockquote>
"Well,  I tried starting our little friend today but burnt out one of the
 TIP32Cs in my Tesla coil after 2 minutes attempting to start it.  Knew I
 should have put them on a heatsink.  I will have to get a replacement as all
 others have now been pressed into service in the SGIL1 :).
<p>
 It did start and run once for about 10 seconds using the Tesla coil before
 winking out so it isn't a problem with the ignite board.
<p>
 I have changed everything (Excluding the transformer) in SGIL1.  It's
 definitely the tube as as we have discovered before, it happily powers a
 60X."
</blockquote>
<p>
Two weeks later:
<p>
<blockquote>
"This morning at 2:33 am I was watching a Star Trek episode after previously
 finally got my NEC3030 to run (now nicknamed Kes), she finally said goodbye
 in spectacular fashion: Towards the end of the episode, the cathode opened up
 letting off a large white flash of light and finally ending the saga.
<p>
 It was running beautifully.  I even had the clamp meter across it and in full
 view of the TV so I could keep an eye on it, doing 6 A.  Then, without
 warning, the cathode gave out with the filament opening up half way between
 the second and third windings back from the OC.
<p>
 It was both disappointing and sort of heartbreaking to see such a project die
 spectacularly considering I pumped more than $2000 into it over 3 years and
 with 4 power supply rebuilds. We tried, we failed, but I intend to get a
 new tube and hook it to BJ/SGIL1. I will be taking photographs next week
 and sending them to you along with hand drawn schematics. I would like to
 ask a favor from you and Steve, silly though it sounds, we have all been
 involved in Kes' operation and construction, and in her repair and demise.
 (no, i don't blame either of you, it was a high mileage tube), and that is
 for both of you to sign a small square of paper (say 2" square) to be stuck
 to its chassis as a reminder of the fun I had putting it all together the
 4th time over.
<p>
 (The photos and schematics will eventually become a part of this document and
 will also appear on <A HREF="http://homepages.tig.com.au/~macgyver/">Ben's

<p>
 I would like to stress to everyone out there that when building any large
 project (it being a laser or anything else) involving large voltages or
 currents, that things can and DO go wrong, sometimes for unknown reasons. It
 hurts, especially when you spend a large (or a small amount) of money on a
 project only to have it die on you. Well, my small world did collapse into a
 singularity, but only for a moment. The chassis of the NEC3030 (Kes) will be
 placed on display in my living room. The strange (to the uneducated eye)
 looking piece of equipment is sure to attract attention from newcomers and
 friends alike. I think I will go and play some depressing music now....."

<h4><A NAME="ascbj12">Ben's New Toy</A></h4>

No, not the laser mentioned above. :-)
<p>
(From: Ben (macgyver@ihug.com.au).)
<p>
For the BJ/SGIL1, I have obtained a 60X with 3500 hours on the clock for
nothing - a newly made friend of mine knew I was into lasers and rocked up
with a printing machine that had gone belly up - he said "I think you might
be interested in it - there's a laser warning sticker on the back  - maybe
you can pull the laser out". It was a Xerox machine and the way it looked, i
thought the laser would be totally wrecked - some gorillas had kicked it
around a bit. ;)  But once I got inside I found a healthy PSU (bonus) and a
fully functional (after some mirror tweaking) 60X head. Now I will have to
build in a starting booster to the BJ/SGIL1, but this will wait a short
period - the supply in the printer thingie works well and I am having oodles
of fun playing with the laser.  The transformer out of the homemade supply is
being used to step the voltage down to run the new supply - I gather the
factory/whatever it was working in had a stepdown transformer somewhere
around but this unit was definitely for 115 VAC - there was no stepdown
transformer inside, and AC in sticker said 115 VAC. I haven't had a chance to
measure the power output yet but I think it's probably 200 to 230 mW as it
appears nearly as bright as Marks 60X.
<p>
The box is a gold colour, with the fan on top as per usual, and a funny
looking gadget on the OC - adjusting its screw causes the colour to shift
slightly (line selecting prism?). The rear is just covered up, apart from
the mirror adjustments (accessible through 2 holes.). The fan was removed and
a more powerful (the 250 cfm from the broken NEC) was put in its place, and
it runs of the 240 VAC line.
<p>
The power supply is basically similar to the one shown in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under "American
Laser Corporation Laser Heads and Power Supply".  The interior looks like a
birds nest of wires, cables, connectors and components, which are more neatly
arranged now thanks to some cable ties.  The connection to the laser is an AMP
twist connector and to the PSU, a square connector with a special shaped pin
to prevent backwards connection of the umbilical.
<p>
However, it was obviously modified by the Xerox people with changes to the
front panel control pots, laser umbilical connection, and the substitution of
a pair of 80 mm fans to cool the pass bank heatsink, instead of the single
120 mm fan.  (This is obvious because of the 45 mm steel plate bolted into
position to cover the "gap" which would have been sealed by the 120 mm fan,
and that the side of the box has had an extra 40 mm cut out of it to
accommodate the extra width of the two side by side 80 mm fans.)

<h4><A NAME="ascbj13">Power Supply and 60X Update</A></h4>

(From: MacGyver (macgyver@ihug.com.au).)

I have built a starting booster into the home made argon supply so it can
power my 60X tube which it is doing now without any problems. I noticed the
addition of SG-IX1 and SG-IY1 to the FAQ and decided to convert my brute force
starter into a SGIXY1 - a slight modification.  I used a couple of relays in
tandem with the pass bank/ballast to enable lower voltages on the front panel
to switch the main voltage to the tube. A manual ignition button was added for
that nifty "Fire on my command" effect, and it's a BIG red button marked
(obviously) 'Fire'. The switch is after the 270 ohm 1/2 W resistor. (actually
a relay in tandem with a low voltage switch). An LDR and transistor switch
provided with 12 V illuminates the 'Tube On' indicator when the tube is
started.  It is called Tube On' (and not Beam On), because it indicates that a
plasma is present, but the beam may not be present if the mirrors are
misaligned.  Nicer, simpler design, and the extras came from parts in my
junkbox, a microwave oven, and an old B/W telly. It too works well, although
the relay contacts in the boost supply sometimes generate a small spark on
ignition. I will replace it later when I have the time (too low a rating for
the voltage involved).
<p>
Anyway, I will say I have concluded that my NEC tube died for age reasons, as
the 60X has now been doing 4 hours 5 days a week without a problem off the
BJ/SGIl1 without problems, and the staff using it are much happier with its
simpler operation than the gold box supply which was originally powering it.

<h3>Flavio's Basic Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply (FS-IT1)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascfs10">General Description of FS-IT1</A></h4>

(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
My power supply has a 240 VAC input, 1.5 kVA (an overkill - but it was free)
transformer that outputs 85 & 95 volts on the secondary side. This secondary
voltage is fed to a bridge rectifier and its associated filter caps.
<p>
Note: where voltages are mentioned below, they refer to the AC transformer
output (VRMS) and NOT the peak rectified and filtered DC.
<p>
Current control is achieved with three series connected 1 ohm, 100 W resistors.
I have installed switches that allow me to cut in and out one or two resistors
for further current control.
<p>
This is actually the 2nd revision of my power supply. My original supply was
housed in a plain 19" power supply case. I had a cable coming out of this box,
and the case itself was very flimsy. That power supply had no meters to
monitor tube statistics, nor any safety features.
<p>
My new supply is housed in a professional 19" power supply case which features
supporting bars that the panels bolt into - this is very handy, as the stepdown
transformer is quite heavy.
<p>
The internal componentry is virtually the same as the first power supply, with
added basic features:
<ul>
<li>The main power resistors bolt into a large heatsink.  This protrudes
 through the back panel of the supply case.
<p>
<li>The main power (transformer primary) switch is now mounted on the front
 panel rather than being part of the line cord. :)
<p>
<li>Two switches have been added for current control which each bypass one of
 the three 1 ohm ballast resistors.
<p>
<li>Sockets have been added which do away with the length of cable that used
 to dangle from the supply.
</ul>

New safety and protection features include:

<ul>
<li>Voltage and current panel meters enable viewing of the tube's statistics
 and have been an invaluable tool.
<p>
<li>Interlock loops in the umbilical/laser head assembly - If the laser head
 and cable are not connected, the supply will not be energized.
<p>
<li>Thermal protection - Cuts power to the tube if its temperature rises
 too high (but the laser head fan remains on).
</ul>
Overall, the power supply also has better heatsinking for the resistors and the
bridge rectifier, and runs cooler than the original supply. I have also added
two small fans in the supply.
<p>
Possible upgrades to the new power supply which I may implement in the future
include adding additional DC filtering and a transistor pass-bank.
<p>
One problem that I have found when powering different argon ion tubes is that
they all have slightly different characteristics (gas pressures, etc.), and one
major problem is that the power supply and need to be impedance matched (so I
have been told). I have experienced this when I have had a hard time trying to
start tubes.
<p>
I have used this power supply with the NEC-3030, ALC-60X, and Spectra-Physics
161B tubes without any major problems (actually the NEC tube is the only
stubborn one).
<p>
For my ALC-60X tube, I have to use the 95 VAC tap on the transformer as the
lower voltage one will not allow the tube to start.
<p>
For my NEC-3030 tube, at times I have a hard time starting or keeping the tube
running based on the following conditions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cold tube: If the voltage is too high from the transformer (above 90 Volts)
 then the tube will not strike - this is possibly the impedance problem.
<p>
<li>Current too high: In this case,  the tube will cut out (I have no problem
 with this behavior - it protects the tube from excessive current!).
</ul>
<p>
P.S. To prolong the life of your tube, do not exceed 12 A.  I actually run at
around 8 A.

<p>
Here are some photos of my new and improved power supply:
<ul>
<li><A HREf="fsitfrn.jpg">FS-IT1 - Front Panel</A> shows the overall front view
 of the power supply. The panel meters are in the center, with the mains/supply
 switches on the left and current control switches on the right.  The left and
 right meters display ion tube voltage and current respectively.
<p>
<li><A HREF="fsitbck.jpg">FS-IT1 - Back Panel</A> shows the large multi-pin
 MIL-SPEC socket that connects to the laser tube via an umbilical cable that I
 also built. 240 VAC is supplied to the unit via a standard IEC connector. The
 small square device located under the heatsink is the 10 amp circuit breaker.
 Part of the 300 mm lon heatsink is shown in the photo. The power resistors are
 directly bolted onto the heatsink.
<p>
<li><A HREF="fsitint.jpg">FS-IT1 - Interior</A> shows the overall inside of the
 power supply. The large stepdown transformer is in the center, bridge
 rectifier is on the left, filter capacitors on the right, and the power
 resistors shown in the top of the photo.
<p>
 The heart of the power supply is the stepdown transformer, rated at a whopping
 1.5 kVA. It has a 240 Volt primary and delivers the following secondary
 voltages: 85, 95, 110, and the 3 Volt at 25 amps for the filament.  This
 transformer weighs in at 12 KG.
<p>
 The main power resistors that control the tube current are visible on the
 heatsink at the rear panel of the enclosure. These resistors are rated at 1
 ohm, 100 watts each.  Two of the resistors are connected to the current
 control switches on the front of the supply.

<h3>Andrew's Basic Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply (AB-IT1)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="ascab10">General Description of AB-IT1</h4>

(From: Andrew Baluk (ovlov@ihug.com.au).)
<p>
My argon ion laser power supply is very similar to the other 'testing' PSUs
with the exception of the following minor details:
<p>
<ul>
<li>I used two 300 VA 40-40 toroids with the secondaries in series to make 80 V
and then paralleled with the other to make 80 V at 7.25 A.
<p>
<li>The filament winding was made by stripping one conductor out of solid core
 mains cabling like you use in the wall of a house. I wrapped around 5 turns
 around each of the 300 VA cores and then paralleled those.  I then reduced
 the number of turns until I got 2.7 VAC for the filament.  (NEC-3030 says 2.6
 VAC.)
<p>
<li>A 400 V, 35 A bridge works fine.
<p>
<li>I got four 15,000 uF, 80 V electrolytic capacitors for AUS$10 each and
 then wire then in parallel and series to get a nice 15,000 uF filter cap at
 around 140 V.  I was going to put balancing resistors but I got lazy. I am
 using a bleeder across the whole bank, about 500K.  It takes about 40
 minutes to suck the cap down.
<p>
 This produces 125 VDC - nice and lethal!
<p>
<li>A series pass-bank of three 1 ohm 50 W resistors gets the current to about
 6.5 A.  The resistors are bolted to a large aluminum plate covering about
 60% or the area of the 19 inch rack case to act as a heatsink.  The toroids
 are bolted to the base of the case and the plate mounts about 10 mm above
 that 1/2 way up the 140 mm rack case height.
<p>
<li>I have a 117 CFM, 120 mm special model fan (others only do 105 CFM!!! 8-)
 blowing into the case directly across the pass-bank and plate.
<p>
 With all this the plate still gets DAMN hot. I had to raise some wire with
 little ceramic blocks siliconed to the place.  (Oh well, 6.5A * 45V = lots of
 watts!)
<p>
<li>I used a 4 A, 15-15 conventional transformer to supply both the 15V-15V
 power meter boards in the NEC head.  I also run a 3A 12V regulator of it as
 well. To cool the regulator I used a large Pentium Pro heatsink with its own
 fan!!!!  This is really effective and takes up no space at all. (I bet no one
 is doing that trick HA!!!!)
</ul>
<p>
I am still a little worried about running such a rudimentary PSU for long
periods. I have a 7 A, 240 VAC mains filter built into the PSU but I am still 
worried about tube life, etc. I may add one of the simple linear regulators
in the future.  I have run the light feedback line from the laser head back
into the PSU but am currently not using it.

<h3>WL's Switchmode Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply</h3>

(From: WL (wlg@span.ch).)
<p>
I have built a few (lower power) argon ion laser power supplies inspired by the  
schematics elsewhere in this chapter. These include various linearly regulated  
ones, especially I liked your <A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdreg2b">Linear
Regulator Using IC</A>. It has various advantages (like the resistors parallel  
to the transistors safeguarding them from the starting pulse and also supplying  
instant power). I measured the left-over ripple to be 0.5%, which is quite good.  
I have built two versions of it, adapted to my 220 VAC to 160 VAC setup. There is  
a link from my Web page (see below) to the design I finally used. However the  
circuit tends to be unstable and oscillates if one is not very careful with the  
wiring to avoid ground loops etc.  This has been confirmed by a few guys at
<A HREF="http://www.laserfreak.de/">Laserfreak</A> who also have
built this circuit.
<p>
Here are some considerations I came across in the context of linear power
supply design.  The main problem was to convert the circuit to run from 230 VAC
rectified (about 310 VDC) for my argon tube which has a discharge voltage
of about 160 VDC. I decided to put in a 1200 W, 10 ohm resistor (fan cooled)
to reduce stress on the transistors. This implied that the voltage drop over
the transistors depended very strongly on the current, like from about 20 V
at full throttle to 120 V at minimum current.  So the circuit had to be
modified that it works at both ends of the voltage range, preventing the IC
from ever getting more than 40 V but always at least a few volts. The main
problem was (and this had cost me some blown transistors) that the current
rating of bipolar transistors at higher voltage is much much less than the
total dissipation would suggest due to the "second breakdown" effect.  For
example the BUS24B that I used (which can in principle stand 400 V and 250 W
Ptot) can take 30 A at about 8 V but only 0.5 A at 100 V.  The solution was
to use many parallel, like 10.  So the moral is: the voltage and Ptot ratings
usually do not apply simultaneously, and this needs to be taken into account
if the voltage drop over the transistors is more than about a dozen volts.
Only the data sheets can tell that, but often they do not contain
these crucial data (Motorola data sheets seem to be pretty good in this
respect, though).  MOSFETs are in general pretty immune to second breakdown and
have a better safety margin in this respect. Comparatively good is also
the 2N3773 which can take a full amp at 100 V.  These seem better suited
than the 2N3055 for typical ion laser power supplies, feeding from about 150 V
down to about 100 V.
<p>
Now I have designed an relatively easy-to-build switcher (inspired by the  
Omnichrome 150 PSU), which can be expanded to supply even 20-30A.
A detailed description and some general considerations are at

<h3>Switchmode Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply for NEC GLG3030 (SX-IP1)</h3>

This is a power supply designed specifically for the NEC GLG-3030 though
it could probably be adapted for other similar small air-cooled lasers.
<p>
It uses a set of switching regulator chips (UC3823/UC3705) to do the hard
stuff and a single big MOSFET (IRF340) to do the switching.  A microwave
oven transformer was torn apart to power the filaments.  The supply is
really stable.  The schematic can be found at

<h3>Mario's Current Regulated Ion Laser Power Supply (MC-IL1)</h3>

(From: Mario (mario.catena@tin.it).)
<p>
Here is my basic ion laser power supply.  It uses an IGBT which simplifies
the control electronics compared to a bipolar transistor pass-bank.
<p>
This PSU features constant current regulation allowing smooth laser power
output control.  I'm currently using it to drive my almost new 092-S
Spectra Physics argon laser and an old semi-dead tube.
<p>
The power section of the PSU is quite straightforward: A bridge rectifier
(two SEMIKRON modules) feeds two big electrolytic capacitors trough a
protection inrush resistor.  Components of this section are very common
and can be replaced with other with equivalent ratings. 
<p>
The main transformer (T1) was salvaged from an old 1.5 kVA UPS.  I've modified
the secondary to achieve about 105 VAC and added the laser heater filament
winding (about 2.9 V center-tapped).
<p>
No boost voltage circuitry is present because I've found no need for on.  The
new 092-S tube starts on the first shot and even the old tube start without
problem.  The igniter circuitry is simply made of a voltage quadrupler that
discharges a 1.5 uF capacitor into the primary of a hand made igniter coil.
<p>
The constant current regulation section is build around an LM358 op-amp and a
power IGBT rated 300 A at 1,200 V (!!).  The LM358 has the common-mode ground
configuration with current sensing feedback on the inverting input set
desired output current according to the reference voltage applied to
the non-inverting input.  The LM358 output pin directly drives the power
IGBT.  Reference voltage should be calibrated at about 1 V using the
2K2 trimmer.  The 10 turn pot allows fine and smooth regulation of the
laser output power.
<p>
The schematic lacks interlocks, a cooling fan, and safety circuitry, as
well of meters and indicators.  But they could be easily added based on
other schematics.

<h3><A NAME="ascold0">Lexel-95 PSU</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
This PSU is 3-phase with a buck/boost transformer and 26 (!!) 2N6259s.  It is
rated at 45 A continous.  Other then the cold plate being a little bigger
to hold the extra transistors, the case being a little larger to hold a
massive three phase buck/boost transformer, and 6 diodes in the rectifier
instead of 4, it's the same beast as the Lexel-88 PSU.  And, no, the pass-bank
drivers were not beefed up to drive the extra 2n6259s!

<h3><A NAME="ascold1">Spectra-Physics 265 Exciter with a 165-3 Argon Head</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
We spent the day working on this model so here is some information:
<p>
The exciter (a.k.a., power supply; Spectra-Physics seems to call all their
units 'exciters') will provide up to 35 amps off of the 230 VAC, three phase
line.  The input pi C-L-C filter network uses a .5 mH inductor (HUGE) with two
3,500 uF capacitors.  Keep in mind that the filament transformer is also a
minor inductor and helps some as well.  And, this is on a three phase system
where the raw ripple is much lower to begin with!
<p>
The linear regulator uses *55* pass-bank transistors (that's right folks, 55
transistors!) wired in series-parallel strings and they are common 23N3055s!!
The pass-bank is on the low or cathode end, as is the igniter transformer.
<p>
The 165-3 argon laser head uses a tube that is 24 inches long nominally
dropping 232 VDC at 30 amps.  This voltage will be lower if the tube pressure
is low and higher if it is too high.  At first, it was only 206 VDC at 30 A.
There is a little reservoir (inside the tube) with a solenoid activated valve
that we used to fill it back up to the desired range.
<p>
The tube has the usual 3 volt 25 to 30 A cathode.
<p>
The laser head includes an axial electromagnet.  Its power supply used 2N3442s
for the regulator which needs to provide around 108 to 216 VDC (adjustable)
into the 49 ohm electromagnet coil.
<p>
This laser would do about 4 watts at 32 A if the tube was good but the
particular version tested had a line selector prism on it, so we could only
run one line at a time.

<h3><A NAME="ascold3">The 'Gold Box' 60X PSU</A></h3>

(Portions from: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
This is a more modern power supply designed for the ALC 60X ion laser head.
It uses 2 MOSFETs driven by a PWM switchmode controller chip for the course
loop to keep the voltage low on the fine loop.  Then, there are two MJE2500
NPN transistors, a quad op-amp to control the linears, and an in-line current
current sense resistor for the whole mess.   This is quite simple, uses
modern chips, and is easily built.  And, best if all if you don't want to build
something from scratch, a bunch of them were dumped on the market last year
and should be available at a reasonable price.  The only downside is that they
are limited to 9 A maximum.  At 10.2 A they start to melt down!  Xerox started
running the tubes at 4.5 A and end of lifetime was 8.2 - never cleaning the
optics or peaking them, they tuned these lasers to do 23 mW through their
life.  This is exactly the opposite of tuning them for max power - Xerox
turned them down for whatever reason. 
<p>
When one of these fails, the most common 'fault' is that the high limit was
turned up too much. Gold Boxes use a sloping ramp PWM system, if you turn up
the high limit, you have to readjust the rest of the ramp generator, else boom!
<p>
Gold boxes are a huge rats-nest of unmarked white teflon wire in bundles, with
parts mounted seemingly at random through out the case, on multiple boards.
Attempting to trace out the circuit is very difficult.  It took me two months
to do the first one!  They have multiple nested loop control systems.  So it's
a lose-lose situation.  And, you have untrained users with no budget who think
they are gods gift to electronic systems!
<p>
And Marlin-Landmark manufacturered Gold Boxes with MOSFETs will NOT
exceed 9.5 amps by design.  They are guaranteed to explode at currents
much greater then 9 A.  You can tell the difference: the case is about 2"
smaller then a traditional Gold Box in one dimension.

<h3><A NAME="ascold4">High Performance PSU for High-End Ion Laser</A></h3>

(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
As an example of a sophisticated PSU, I have schematics for one that will
source 7 to 35 A using just four 2N6259s!  How do they get away with it?
An SCR bridge upstream of the linear pass-bank keeps the voltage across the
2N6259s at about 8 volts maximum.  Of course it's a three-phase beastie and
they use 6 SCRs for fine control, but I'm working on adapting it to my Lexels.
After all, most of the circuits are the same.  They use diodes in series with
each of the transistor bases so if you get a short the rest of the transistors
are still in loop and the driver transistors have a chance of surviving. 
<p>
Since the ripple from rectifying the three-phase is 360 Hz instead of 120 Hz,
filtering components (Cs and L) don't need to be as massive as for single-phase
designs.
<p>
They have a way around the SCR shorts as well (which if not dealt with would
result in cascade failures of the pass-bank transistors and other components).
A massive clamp diode array and 4 fuses made of #28 AWG wire (it's right on
the schematic|), for emitter fuses: "For F1-F4, stretch #28 copper from P1
to...".
<p>
The only other mod to the pass-bank compared to what we are familiar with is
adding 470 Ohm pull-down resistors from the base to the top of the emitter
resistors since they have the diodes in series with the base drive, I guess
they needed something to make sure the transistors turn off. 
<p>
This supply is really complex cause it was made for a $45,000 laser, but most
of it is very much similar to the lexel, except they check to see if the
ignite pulse triggers, measure the cathode current and voltage, the tube
current and voltage, the pass-bank current and voltage, and available line
volts, controls each polarity of each phase independently, has linear and BCD
control inputs changes some circuit values automatically if it's driving a
krypton tube and autoswitches from 220 to 440 VAC depending on the available
line voltage and tube pressure from a gauge tube.  The schematics and service
manual fill a three ring binder and its got more circuit cards then the space
shuttle. The linear opto-isolater based control voltage inputs and outputs are
a marvel of design, using 2 opto-isolaters, one for the signal, one for the
correction, and a bunch of PFM/PWM links to isolate the high side from the low
side. However the basic control circuits are simple but it does have shaping
and filtering of the comparator functions for a proper lead/lag loop.
<p>
The SCR chopper seems to be a excellent candidate for home built PSUs, if the
filter inductor can be kludged with a common part everyone can get, I think 4
to 6 2N3055s would do quite nicely air cooled. 

<h3><A NAME="ascold5">The Really Strange Carson PSU</A></h3>

This was one of two power supplies that were part of a dual tube water-cooled
ion laser - the other PSU had apparently been stripped for parts and disposed
of along with the pretzel form-factor laser tubes. :(  For a description of
the optics, see the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argold0">The Really Strange
Carson Dual Tube Ion Laser</A>.
<p>
(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
The Carson PSU is bizzare - looks like a cross between a ancient Lexel, an
older Coherent supergraphite, and an Ionics in circuit design.
<p>
It is in a 19" rack case about 8 inches tall with sides and top in a simulated
wood finish, weight about 20 to 25 pounds tops.  (Don't you love that genuine
simulated imitation wood grain finish - they just don't make them like that
anymore! --- sam.)
<p>
On the front is a small 0 to 30 Amp Meter, a red bar that lights up "power on",
a 2 amp fuse, plus a knob on a potentiometer that has an off position, where
you can hear the click of a switch. Nice rack handles on the front. :)
<p>
On the back, there is no head connector, just a bundle of wires going to the
head, one hose barb labeled "water in", one labeled "to laser", and one
standard #8, 3 conductor with ground three-phase cable.
<p>
With the bottom lid off, there is a water cooled resistor, a long linear one,
not the block type used on a Ionics.
<p>
With the top lid off, there is a cold plate with 36 transistors in 3 rows
of 12, and another row of 5 off to the side.  The tops of the transistors face
inside the PSU, so I can't see what they are.  Six power diodes are also on the
cold plate like an older Lexel.  There is also a control card (with a 741 and a
couple of small transistors on it) along the side under the cold plate, the
usual fan, a pressure switch, a couple of caps, a breaker, and a filament
transformer. 
<p>
It seems to be a hybrid of just about every older style PSU design I've seen.
That's why I'm so curious. 
<p>
On the back is a nameplate "Carson Model 150 Laser Power Supply, Carson Inc,
Beverly Mass, Industrial and Scientific".  The unit was pulled from a dual
tube laser with glass tubes, which I did not see although the person who got
the optics (sam) has told me they are soft coated as he tried to clean one
with isopropyl alcohol and water and damaged it. The laser was really unusual
as the optics configuration was a folded resonator with the tubes in series.
And the optics are apparently white light from the markings on them.  I just
got the one PSU as the heads are long gone (having been physically destroyed,
either accidentally or on purpose).
<p>
There is no interlock or remote connector or danger stickers. I'm thinking it
might be before CDRH.  The electronics are late 60s early 70s. 
<p>
(After a couple hours during which Steve found his Dremel tool.)
<p>
EeeeeK, I took a Dremel tool and put slots into the security screws, I have
been cursed, it's a Dieonics. 41 DTS-110s by GM Delco DIV. I know why the
tubes were crushed, it was out of mercy to the next person who would have
tried to use it. Just hauling it across a lab can ruin the laser if you
don't lift it properly. 
<p>
I have a lot of experience with the DTS-423, and they are $25 each to replace.
I had to have them custom ordered from a company that specializes in obsolete
parts. I imagine DTS-110 will be the same situation, I doubt if they cross to
anything sane.
<p>
Evidently Carson was a small manufacturer that never caught on.  Their designs
were copied and improved up Laser Ionics.  Strangely though, this unit is much
better built and cleaner then the Ionics units I've seen as well as being much
lighter.  They made their PSUs out of 1/4" steel.

The PSU is a clone or predecessor of a Laser Ionics PSU. I have some recent
experience working on these.  They are the Hindenburg of ion lasers.  You can
never turn your back on one. Only way they stayed in biz was their relative
lower costs. It had real time active cavity stabilization in the form of: your
hands!  They never stay at the same power for more then 2.5 minutes from
backlash and big gaps in the gears.  I think I forwarded the emails from a
past Ionics owner on pointers for keeping them working to you.
<p>
This one has NO choke. I also wonder if it needs a separate three-phase 10 tap
buck- boost transformer most Ionics are shipped with, or if the choke was in
the head.  The control card is much different in design, however with its
single 741 and 3 small driver transistors.
<p>
The laser used a Quartz tube with tungsten disks literally glassed into the
magnet and resonator assembly.  You couldn't repump or rebuild the tube as it
had tubes and reservoirs shooting all around it.  The gas return pipe went
around the magnet on the outside, the reservoirs were mounted underneath the
aluminum 'U" channel, and the resonator was mounted on. That also explains the
soft optics - ionics used soft optics in all their mixed gas products. I
have a feeling Carson was either a customer or predecessor of Laser Ionics. 
<p>
Laser Ionics folded about 4 years ago. They never bothered to change their tube
design.  The only thing they ever did was add a chemisorption pump for
pressure control. They did have the best cost:watt ratio in the business, if
you didn't mind having to stock 3 to 4 control cards as 2 would always be under
repair while the 3rd was in the laser. Their customers at first were just
about everybody who needed a laser as theirs was cost effective. Once you
learned their quirks, you could keep one running.  It took me about two weeks
to learn all the possible explosion points, and I learned how to lay new
copper traces on cards using copper tape from a stained glass shop and eyelets
that go through the board. 
<p>
In the end it was mainly people who needed brute force low quality units,
laser shows and people pumping dyes.  Ionics did make a 60 Watt Argon
at one time, the largest ever for commercial sale until the end of the Iron
Curtain.
<p>
Closer examination shows a regulator instead of a flow switch.  It doesn't
have a flow interlock. 
<p>
The theory of operation is quite simple. the big water cooled resistor in the
base sets the minimum tube current.  It's in series with the tube. 40 of the
41 transistors are across the resistor, and serve as a variable resistance
paralleling the water cooled monster.  The 41st transistor is the drive for
the rest of the pass-bank.  By paralleling the power resistor, the transistors
never see HV.  You drive the transistors a little more and they "lift" off the
resistor and take over driving the tube. 
<p>
This is probably a 2 to 3 watt unit.  At least I don't have to do any reverse
engineering except for the card, as I have a ionics manual and schematics. I
have the %$@# manual memorized from the 12 watt unit I worked on. The
schematics are so old they did them on a blueprint machine with diazo inks.
Ionics used the same PSU for every unit.  They just changed the water cooled
resistor block and a couple of resistors.  You've seen one Ionics PSU, you've
seen them all.  This one had a extra light card to interface with the whatever
it was in.  It's unusual as it has no jacks or meter to measure tube current.
<p>
As I noted above, if the Carson tubes were anything like the Ionics, somebody
crushed them for sanity reasons, to prevent the spread of operator insanity!
I recently repaired an Ionics for a car dealership using it as a beam effect
in the showroom.  It never stayed at the same power for more then 2 minutes.
Average life of the control card between repairs on them was 2 weeks. I
ended up making new cards with beefed up traces to stop the explosions.  It
had a real weird fault: If you used plastic op-amps, they couldn't handle the
heat dissipation and failed quickly, so I had to hunt down what were perhaps
the last 14 pin DIP ceramic 741s in the US. Ionics stayed in business for
about 15 years simply because they had the lowest dollar per watt ratio but
they never changed their design to improve with the times. 
<p>
This is a antique, one of the very first ion lasers to hit the market.  The
supply just needs the addition of a big choke, a flow switch, and possibly an
overtemp switch to bring it up to today's standards. I will delete and replace
the copper oxide rectifier for the control circuits for sanity reasons.
Modern supplies have a ripple of about .05%, but I can live with the 5%
ripple this will have. Modern supplies also weight about 6X as much for some
reason.
