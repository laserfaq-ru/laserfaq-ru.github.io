<h2>Основные характеристики, конструкция, безопасность, распространенные типы</h2>
<h3><A NAME="diocss0">Введение в диодные лазеры и лазерные диоды</A></h3>

Замечание: в этом документе мы будем использовать термины "лазерный диод"
и "диодный лазер" иногда вперемешку, хотя мы стараемся использовать термин
"диодный лазер" по отношению к законченному устройству. Когда прибор называется
"лазерный диод", это обычно означает комбинацию кристаллов полупроводника, которая
непосредственно выполняет генерацию лазерного излучения, вместе с кристаллом
измерительного фотодиода (испольщуемого для обратной связи, регулирующей
выходную мощность) расположенную в корпусе (обычно с тремя выводами), который
похож на транзистор в металлическом корпусе с окошком наверху.
Они затем монтируются и могут быть скомбинированы с управляющей схемой и оптикой
в "диодный лазерный модуль" или распространенную (красную) лазерную указку.
Рисунок "<A HREF="lds.gif">Разновидности маленьких лазерных диодов"</A> демонстрирует
некоторые примеры.
<p>
В диодных лазерах для генерации когерентного света используются почти
микроскопические кристаллы арсенида галлия или других экзотических полупроводников
в очень маленьком корпусе. Разность энергий между полосой проводимости и валентной
полосой - это то, что определяет механизм лазерной генерации. Это не тот тип лазера,
который можно сделать с нуля в своем подавле, поскольку требуемая технология
производства требует установок за мегабаксы и более. Вам придется удовлетвориться
заводскими лазерными диодами, питаемыми от самодельного драйвера, или использовать
готовые модули вроде лазерных указок. К счастью, лазерные диоды теперь относительно
недороги (и цены падают, пока вы читаете это) и широко доступны.
<p>
Активный элемент диодного - это твердотельное устройство, почти не отличающееся от
светодиода. Первые из них были разработаны сравнительно рано в истории лазеров,
но до начала 1980-х годов не получали широкого распространения - и их цены
соответственно понизились. Сейчас есть много разновидностей - некоторые из них
испускают много *ватт* оптической мощности. Самые распространенные типы, используемые
в популярных устройствах вроде CD-плееров и лазерных указок, имеют максимальную выходную
мощность в диапазоне от 3 до 5 мВт.
<p>
Типичная конфигурация распространенного маломощного лазерного диода с боковым
излучением показана ниже:

<p>
Приведенная выше конфигурация называется "гомопереходом", так как в ней есть только
один P-N-переход. Выяснилось, что есть преимущества в использовании нескольких
радом расположенных переходов, образованных слоями материала P- и N-типа.
Они называются "лазерными диодами на гетеропереходах". Существует много других,
более сложных структур, используемых сегодня и разрабатываемых, пока вы читаете это!
Например, смотрите в разделе "<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diocss8">Vertical Cavity
Surface Emitting Laser Diodes (VCSELs)</A>" описание одного из типов устройств,
имеюшего большой потенциал влияния на многие области технологии.
<p>
"Торцы" - это зеркала, образующие резонатор диодного лазера. Они могут быть просто
сколотыми поверхностями кристалла полупроводника или могут быть оптически отшлифованы,
отполированы и покрыты.
<p>
У этих типов лазерных диодов все происходит внутри чипа. Таким образом длина волны
излучения фиксированная и определяется свойствами полупроводникового материала
и физической структурой устройства. Или, как минимум, это то, как они должны
работать, так как отражение света обратно в лазер может приводить к проблемам
стабильности или даже может быть обращено на пользу с целью стабилизирования
частоты выходного излучения. Существуют также перестраиваемые диодные лазеры,
использующие внешний оптический резонатор для получения непрерывного, и во многих
случаях широкого спектра возможных длин волн без прыжков моды.
<p>
Бывают и импульсные лазерные диоды, требующие много ампер для достижения порога
генерации и выдающие ватты выходной мощности, но только на короткое время
- микросекунды и меньше. Средняя мощность, вероятно, несколько мВт. Это
арсенид-галлиевые (GaAs) лазерные диоды на гетеропереходах. Они не очень
распространены сейчас, но некоторые магазины старья продают подобные диоды
как часть дальномера танка "Чифтен". Они называют высокую пиковую мощность,
но не низкую среднюю. :( Современные устройства с подобными характеристиками
также выпускаются компаниями вроде 
"<A HREF="http://www.osram-os.com/">OSRAM Opto Semiconductors</A>".  Зайдите на
"Products", "High Power Laser Diodes", "Product Catalog...", "Pulsed
Laser Diodes in Plastic Packages".
<p>
Электрическое питание лазерного диода может быть обеспучено специальным
источником постоянного тока со стабилизацией тока или драйвером, который
модулирует его или генерирует импульсы на потенциально очень высокой
скорости передачи данных для связи по оптоволокну или открытому пространству.
Ширина полосы во много МГц возможна с помощью существующих чипов-драйверов.
<p>
Однако, в отличие от светодиодов, лазерные диоды требуют гораздо большей
заботы от их управляющей электроники, иначе они *погибнут* - немедленно.
Есть максимальный ток, который нельзя превышать даже на микросекунду - и он
зависит от конкретного устройства и от температуры P-N-перехода. Другими
словами, во многих случаях недостаточно посмотреть на спецификации из
справочника и просто использовать источник постоянного тока. Чувствительность
к превышению тока получается из-за очень сильной положительной обратной связи,
которая имеется, когда лазеный диод генерирует. Из-за сконцентрированного
электромагнитного поля лазерного луча происходит практически мгновенное
повреждение торцов кристалла (зеркал). Чтобы скомпенсировать влияние температуры
и разницу экземпляров лазерного диода, обычно используется петля обратной связи
по излучению лазера. Прочитайте разделы по лазерным диодам из CD и видимым
ниже в этом тексте, прежде чем пытаться включить или хотя бы взять в руки
такой лазер. Не все устройства одинаково чувствительны к маленькому насилию,
но лучше ошибиться в безопасную сторону (с точки зрения вашего кошелька и
самолюбия!).
<p>
В своем большинстве лазерные диоды очень компактны - активный элемент размером
всего с песчинку, маломощные (и низковольтные), относительно эффективны
(особенно по сравнению с газовыми лазерами, которые они заменили), прочны
и надежны при правильном обращении.
<p>
На самом деле, мощные лазерные диоды - те, которые выдают ВАТТЫ оптической
мощности - без сомнения являются наиболее эффективными излучателями света
(не только среди лазеров), существующими на сегодняшний день. Некоторые из
них имеют электрооптический КПД (соотношение Вт постоянного тока на входе и
Вт света на выходе) более 50 процентов! Другими словами, дайте 2 Вт электричества
на вход и получите 1 Вт света на выходе. И продолжаются исследования с целью
улучшить этот показатель до 80% и выше. Обычная лампочка накаливания имеет
КПД около 5 процентов, флюоресцентные (энергосберегающие - <i>прим. перев.</i>)
лампы - 15 или 20 процентов, мощные газоразрядные лампы немного лучше, но
даже лучшие не могут сравниться с существующими лазерными диодами. Только
подумайте: если такие мсуперэффективные лазерные диоды станет можно делать
для видимого спектра массово и заменить ими все лампочки, потребление
электричества в мире сильно уменьшилось бы, не говоря уже о доступе
любителей к мощным лазерам! (Что гораздо важнее!) Ладно, вернемся с небес
на землю.
<p>
Лазерные диоды имеют некоторые недостатки, помимо критичных требований к
питанию. Оптические характеристики обычно хуже, чем у лазеров других
типов. В частности, длина когерентности и монохроматичность некоторых
типов (диодных) лазеров обычно отвратительная. Это неудивительно,
с учетом длины лазерного резонатора в долю миллиметра, образованного
P-N-переходом в полупроводнике типа III-V между сколотыми гранями.
Сравните это даже с самыми маленькими гелий-неоновыми лазерами с резонатором
около 10 см. Поэтому такие лазерные диоды непригодны в качестве источников
свтеа для высококачественной голографии или интерферометрии на больших
расстояниях. Но, разумеется, даже лазерная указка за $8,95 может работать
достаточно хорошо для опытов в этих областях, и некоторые результаты
неожиданно хороши, несмотря на распространенное мнение о качестве
лазерных диодов.
<p>
Даже не будучи такими же хорошими, как гелий-неоновые лазеры в отношении
когерентности и стабильности, для многих применений лазерные диоды
идеально подходят, и их преимущества - особенно малый размер, маленькая
мощность и низкая цена - значительно перевешивают любые недостатки.
На самом деле, эти "недостатки" могут стать достоинствами, если лазерный
диод используется просто как источник освещения, так как нежелательные
спеклы и эффекты интерференции значительно подавляются.
<p>
Как уже замечалось, не все лазерные диоды имеют одинаковое качество.

<h3><A NAME="diocss1">Примеры распространенных лазерных диодов</A></h3>

Рисунок <A HREF="lds.gif">"Разновидности маленьких лазерных диодов"</A>
демонстрирует те, которые обычно бывают в CD-плеерах, приводах CDROM,
лазерных принтерах и сканерах штрих-кода.
Они отсканированы на 150 dpi. Слева направо: лазерные диоды из CD-плееров, 
приводов CDROM и лазерных принтеров. Тот, что в середине, тоже из лазерного принтера.
Компоненты диодного лазерного модуля справа - от сканера штрих-кода. Сам лазерный
диод закреплен на дальнем конце алюминиевого блока, и одноэлементная пластиковая
линза - все, что нужно, чтобы получить достаточно хорошо сфокусированный луч.
<p>
Увеличенные изображения ниже отсканированы на 600 dpi - лазерные диоды (по крайней
мере те маленькие, с которыми мы работаем) не такие ОГРОМНЫЕ! Эти два лазерных
диода также есть на групповом снимке выше.
<p>
Рисунок <A HREF="kssld.gif">"Лазерный диод вблизи"</A> от
<A HREF="kss361a.gif">лазерной головки Sony KSS361A</A> представляет собой тип лазеров,
находящихся во многих плеерах CD и приводов CDROM производства Sony. Собственно лазерный
диод находится внутри бронзового цилиндра, показанного на фотографии оптической головки.
Передняя часть корпуса скошена, так что выходное окно (с антиотражающим покрытием)
также расположено под углом, чтобы исключить попадание любых остаточных отражений от окна
- как бы малы они ни были - обратно в резонатор лазерного диода или их воздействие на
детектируемый сигнал. Выходное излучение этих диодов с торцевой эмиссией поляризовано.
(Смотрите раздел <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioibrw">"What is a Brewster window?"</A>.)
<p>
Изображенный на рисунке <A HREF="ldclose.gif">"Типичный лазерный диод вблизи"</A> 
диод - из лазерного принтера. Он был закреплен в массивном (хотя бы по сравнению с
размером этого диода) модуле, который содержал линзу объектива и обеспечивал совершенно
необходимое охлаждение. В некоторых высококачественных лазеных принтерах температуру
лазерного диода обеспечивает твердотельный охладитель Пельтье. Маломощные лазерные диоды
в плеерах CD и LD, а также в CDROM и других оптических приводов (во всяком случае, непишущих)
в большинстве своем не требуют этого, охлаждение обеспечивается рамой оптического блока,
а многим не требуется даже этого, что позволяет делать конструкцию целиком из пластика.

<h3><A NAME="diocss2">Различия между светодиодами и лазерными диодами</A></h3>

(Прислал: Don Stauffer (stauffer@htc.honeywell.com).)
<p>
Можно рассматривать светодиод как лазер без резонатора обратной связи. Светодиод
излучает фотоны за счет рекомбинации электронов. У него очень широкий спектр.
<p>
Когда мы добавляем к нему резонатор с высокой добротностью, обратная связь может
быть достаточно сильной, чтобы вызвать настоящую лазерную генерацию. Большинство
лазерных диодов имеют резонатор прямо на кристалле, но существует и такая штука,
как лазерные диоды с внешним резонатором.
<p>
Добавление высокодобротного резонатора сильно снижает количество мод, на которых
работает устройство (на самом деле, почти неправомерно говорить о структуре мод
по отношению к светодиоду.) В результате сильно сужается (становится более
монохроматической) линия излучения, а пучок в какой-то мере сужается пространственно.
Получить истинно одномодовый луч от обычного лазерного диода все еще нелегко,
поэтому луч не так тонок, а спектральная линия не такая острая, как у газовых лазеров.
<p>
Дополнительную информацию ищите в разделе <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioled">"How LEDs Compare
to Laser Diodes - Wavelengths, Spectrum, Power, Focus, Safety"</A>.

<h3><A NAME="diocss3">Сравнение диодных лазеров с другими типами лазеров</A></h3>

Хотя лазерный диод - это настоящий лазер, а не просто особо роскошный (и дорогой)
светодиод, он значительно отличается от газовых и твердотельных лазеров -
не всегда в худшую сторону.
<p>
(Прислал: Don Stauffer (stauffer@htc.honeywell.com).)
<p>
Да, конечно, диодный лазер - настоящий лазер. Как уже говорилось, с количественной
точки зрения труднее сделать диодный лазер с очень узкой спектральной линией излучения,
чем газовый или большой твердотельный. Увеличение длины резонатора как правило приводит
к сужению линии (в пространстве спектров, но высокодобротные резонаторы сужают
луч и в пространстве). Можно использовать большой высокодобротный внешний резонатор
с лазерным диодом, чтобы увеличить его когерентность.
<p>
(Прислал: David Schaafsma (drdave@jnpcs.com) and Rajiv Agarwal
       (agarca@giascl01.vsnl.net.in).)
<p>
Пара небольших замечаний:
<p>
Высокодобротные резонаторы сужают пространственный профиль только если они конфокальны
- плоские высокодобротные резонаторы (как в диодных лазерах, и особенно в диодных лазерах
с вертикальным резонатором) подвержены проблемам ухода луча и должны быть
физически ограничены.
<p>
В газовом лазере мы также имеем значительно более узкую линию излучения, и тем самым
спектр усиления спектрально ограничен. Диодные лазеры (будучи полупроводниковыми переходами
зона-зона или экситонными) имеют гораздо более широкий спектр флюоресценции.
<p>
Типичный лазерный диод с торцевыми излучением на самом деле излучает на довольно небольшом
количестве основных мод (особенно если он работает с использованием собственных граней в
качестве резонатора), и хотя каждая из мод генерации "монохроматична", весь спектр - на
самом деле нет. Внешние резонаторы на самом деле единственный способ получить примерно
одномодовый режим работы от диода с торцевым излучением.
<p>
Лазерные диоды с вертикальным резонатором (VCSEL) обычно истинно одномодовые. Причина,
почему можно удлинять резонатор газового лазера, в том, что вам не приходится беспокоиться
о понижении спектрального диапазона, поскольку ширина линии усиления мала.
<p>
РОС-лазеры (DFB, DBR) дают подобные результаты и имеют степени подавления побочных мод
не хуже 30 дБ. Эти лазеры до сих пор являлись основой оптоволоконных телекоммуникаций.
<p>
Лазеры с распределенной обратной связью (РОС, DFB) используются для дальних телекоммуникаций
- того типа, который использует, например, компания "Sprint" (&gt;1 Гбит до 25 миль) для
своих междугородних телефонных линий. Они же используются для трансатлантических кабелей
между США и Европой. Для ВОЛС между компьютерами (~100 мегабит и менее 1 мили) используются
в основном светодиоды.
<p>
(Прислал: Vishwa Narayan (vishwa.narayan@ericsson.com).)
<p>
Хотя светодиоды достаточно популярны в системах для передачи данных (на действительно
маленьких расстояниях), телекомуникационные системы обычно используют РОСы, модулируемые
либо непосредственно на малых скоростях (например, OC-3 155 Мбит/с) или со внешней
модуляцией для больших скоростей (например, OC-48 2.5 Гбит/с). Расстояния обычно превышают
десятки километров, вплоть до сотен километров с оптическими усилителями, без
повторителей.

<h3><A NAME="diocss4">Техника безопасности диодных лазеров</A></h3>

Несмотря на свой маленький размер и маленькую электрическую мощность, диодные
лазеры все равно представляют большую угрозу для зрения. Это особенно верно
в том случае, если выходной луч сфокусирован и/или невидим (ближний ИК),
и/или если мощность выше типичных 3-5 мВт. Вам разве что не надо беспокоиться
о возможности удара током высокого напряжения (как в He-Ne или аргоновом лазере).
<p>
Никогда нельзя смотреть в луч любого лазера - особенно если он сфокусирован.
Используйте непрямые методы для определения правильности работы, такие как
направление луча на белый кусок картона, использование карточки для обнаружения ИК
или тестера (если надо) или измерителя мощности лазера.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Лазерные диоды в CD-плеерах работают на 780 нм (ближний ИК, почти невидим).
 Пока лазер надежно засунут в оптическую головку, риск весьма невелик, поскольку
 выходное излучение мощностью обычно меньше 1 мВт, а выходящий пучок
 сильно расхожится. Однако, если головка переделана (например, снята линза
 объектива), может получиться сфокусированный луч 5 мВт, который способен
 прожечь дырки в сетчатке вашего глаза, а вы даже не заметите, что что-то
 произошло.
<p>
<li>Распространенные видимые лазерные дииоды, диодные лазерные модули и
 лазерные указки выдают от 1 до 5 мВт на различных длинах волн между 670 и 635 нм.
 Если сколлимированны (как в случае лазерного модуля со встроенной оптикой или
 лазерной указки), весь пучок может войти в глаз и прожечь дырку в сетчатке.
 Обратите внимание, что свет 635 нм кажется больше чем в 5 раз более ярким,
 чем 670 нм. То есть, кажущаяся яркость источника не является надежным
 индикатором его действительной оптической мощности.
<p>
 На сегодняшний день зеленые лазерные указки - не просто диодные лазеры,
 а твердотельные лазеры с диодной накачкой и удвоением частоты (Diode
 Pumped Solid State Frequency Doubled, DPSSFD) (хотя в будущем это может
 измениться). Для заданной мощности зеленый выглядит значительно ярче, чем
 красные длины волн, но мощность также ограничена 5 мВт. Однако, поскольку
 внутри зеленой указки имеется мощный ИК-лазер, а не все указки имеют
 соответствующий фильтр для отсечения ИК, могут присутствовать другие
 источники опасности, даже если зеленый луч полудохлый или отсутствует.
<p>
 (Прислал: Gregory Makhov (lsdi@gate.net).)
<p>
 Согласно последней статье доктора Дэыида Слайни, являющегося одним из ведущих
 "гуру" лазерной безопасности, нет подтвержденных несчастных случаев или травм,
 причиненных лазерными указками мощностью 5 мВт и менее. Есть огромное количество
 болтовни и ложных утверждений относительно этого. Указки очень яркие, могут
 зрительно отвлекать внимание, вызывать остаточные изображения и другие
 эффекты, такие как головные боли, но при большей части типичных условий
 использования НЕ травмируют глаза. Доктор Слайни работает на Вооруженные силы США
 и публикует статьи по лазерной безопасности больше 20 лет.
</ul>
<p>
Помимо этого, луч "голого" лазерного диода сильно расходится и потому представляет
меньшую угрозу, так как хрусталик глаза не может сфокусировать его в маленькое
пятно. Однако, это все еще не причина смотреть в луч.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Записывающие оптические приводы (WORM, CD-R) используют ИК-лазерные диоды,
 выдающие десятки мВт. Типичный привод CD-R устанавливает мощность лазера на
 3-5 мВт при чтении и 25-30 мВт при записи. Разные типы лазерных камер и
 лазерных принтеров могут использовать лазерные диоды мощностью до сотен мВт.
 Они исключительно опасны, даже если не очень хорошо сфокусированы. Более того,
 поскольку они еще и работают на ближнем ИК, ничто не предупреждает о наличии луча.
 На самом деле, поскольку человеческий глаз реагирует на ближний ИК как на очень слабый
 красный свет, можно придти к неверному заключению, что луч является слабым
 видимым, хотя его настоящая мощность в десятки тысяч раз больше, а глаз
 уже поврежден.
<p>
<li>Существуют и становятся все более распространенными и доступными видимые
 и ИК лазерные диоды гораздо большей мощности, по мере того, как растет
 популярность твердотельных лазеров с диодной накачкой (включая зеленые
 лазерные указки, которые содержат мощный ИК лазерный диод). Они представляют
 еще большую опасность для зрения и потенциально даже риск термического
 повреждения или пожара от сфокусированного луча.
<p>
 У этих мощных лазерных диодов даже расходящийся луч "голого" устройства
 (без линзы - <i>прим. перев.</i>) представляет бесспорную опасность на
 небольшом расстоянии. Если есть коллимирующая оптика (хотя бы почти невидимая
 микролинза), результатом будет почти или совсем невидимый луч, который будет
 опасным для зрения от прямого попадания и зеркального отражения на
 расстояниях в несколько метров. Это особенно ужасно для людей, которые
 стали излишне самоуверенными насчет лазерной безопасности, ожидая
 широко расходящегося луча.
</ul>
<p>
Для ИК-лазерных диодов в частности, особенно если вы решили продать изделие:
<p>
(Частично из присланного: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Вы должны поближе познакомиться с правилами CDRH, поскольку на ИК нет моргательного
рефлекса. ИК-лазерные диоды считаются гораздо более опасными и относятся к более
высокому классу опасности. CDRH имеет график мощности по длинам волн, который
используется для определения классов опасности. Единственный случай, когда
ИК-лазер получает класс ниже IIIb (читай: опасный) - это когда луч полностью
закрыт или имеет очень малую мощность. Зайдите на сайт
<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/">CDRH</A>, позвоните им и попросите
прислать пакет документов для производителей по почте. Он огромный и запутанный,
но содержит требования к изделиям, использующим ИК-лазерные диоды, таким как
3-D-сканеры, датчики охранной сигнализации и так далее.

<h3><A NAME="diocss5">Типичные лазерные диоды</A></h3>

Самые распростраенные лазерные диоды на планете на сегодняшний день - те, которые
стоят в CD-плеерах и CDROM-приводах. Они создают (в основном) невидимый луч
в ближней инфракрасной области спектра на длине волны 780 нм. Оптическая мощность
этих лазеров может составлять до 5 мВт, но после прохождения через оптику то, что
попадает на CD, обычно лежит в диапазоне от 0,3 до 1 мВт. Несколько более мощные
инфракрасные лазерные диоды (до 30 мВт) могут оказаться в старых неперезаписывающих
(WORM) и других оптических приводах.
<p>
Видимые лазерные диоды заменили гелий-неоновые лазеры на сканерах штрих-кода в
супермаркетах и не только, в лазерных указках, устройствах позиционирования пациента
в медицине (компьютерных и магниторезонансных томографах, системах лучевой терапии)
и многих других применениях. Первые видимые лазерные диоды излучали на длине волны
около 670 нм в глубокой красной области спектра. Позже подешевели 650-нанометровые
и 635-нанометровые лазерные диоды.
<p>
Из-за неравномерности характеристики глаза, свет 635 нм кажется более чем в 4 раза
ярче, чем свет 670 нм. Поэтому более новые лазерные указки и другие устройства,
использующие видимость луча, делаются на основе этих высокотехнологичных приборов.
На сегодняшний день они более дороги, чем излучающие на 670 нм, но это изменяется
с тем, как DVD становятся более популярными.
<p>
Лазерные диоды в диапазоне от 635 до 650 нм используются в столь хваленой
технологии DVD (Digital Video - или Versatile - Disc), предназначенной для
замены CD и CDROM в ближайшие годы. Более короткие длины волн по сравнению
с 780 нм являются одним из серьезных улучшений, позволяющих DVD хранить в 8
раз больше информации (или еще больше - от 4 до 5 ГБ на слой, спецификация позволяет
иметь до 2 слоев на каждой стороне диска размером с CD) по сравнению со
стандартным объемом информации на CD-диске (650 мегабайт). Побочным эффектом
являются дохлые DVD-плееры и приводы DVDROM (не могу больше ждать)
(уже дождался - <i>прим. перев.</i>), которые дают прекрасные видимые лазерные
диоды для экспериментов. :-)
<p>
Подобно своим ИК-братьям, эти устройства имеют типичную максимальную мощность
от 3 до 5 мВт. Цена от $10 до $50 за простое устройство с лазерным диодом -
больше за оптику и управляющую электронику. Более мощные типы (десятки мВт)
также существуют, но будьте готовы потратить несколько сотен долларов (уже подешевели
- уже можно и за десятку купить - <i>прим. перев.</i>) за что-то вроде
20-милливаттного модуля. Очень мощные диодные лазеры на основе линеек лазерных
диодов могут стоить десятки тысяч долларов!

<h3><A NAME="diocss6">Устройство диодного лазера</A></h3>

Грубая схема лазерного диода того типа, который встречается в (старых - <i>прим. перев.</i>)
лазерных указках и (многих - <i>прим. перев.</i>) CD-плеерах показана ниже.
Она ни в коем случае не в масштабе. Размер всей конструкции обычно от 5 до 10 мм,
но сам кристалл лазерного диода меньше 1 мм в длину.

</PRE>
Основной луч в том виде, в котором он выходит из лазерного диода, клиновидный
и сильно расходящийся (в отличие от гелий-неонового лазера) с типичной
расходимостью от 10 до 30 градусов. Для получения чего-либо подобного параллельному
(коллимированному) лучу требуется внешняя оптика. Простая (сферическая)
короткофокусная двояковыпуклая линза хорошо работает для этих целей, но
диодные лазерные модули и лазерные указки могут использовать линзы как минимум
с одной асферической поверхностью (отшлифованную не по сфере, в отличие от
самых распространенных линз).
<p>
В случае с образцом, который я извлек из дохлого диодного лазерного модуля,
поверхность со стороны лазерного диода была лишь слегка искривлена и асферична,
в то время как другая сторона была сильно выпуклой и сферической. Эффективное
фокусное расстояние линзы было около 5 мм. Она была похожа на линзу объектива
CD-плеера - что, возможно, и было изначальным предназначением этой линзы и
таким образом недорогим источником их.
<p>
Из-за природы излучающего перехода, приводящей к клиновидному лучу неравной
расходимости (обычно примерно 10 x 30 градусов), лазерный диод в какой-то мере
астигматичен. В результате фокусное расстояние, требуемое для коллимации луча по
осям X и Y весьма слабо различается. Поэтому требуется дополнтельная цилиндрическая
линза или единственная линза с астигматической поверхностью, чтобы полностью
скомпенсировать эту характеристику. Однако величина астигматизма обычно невелика,
ее можно проигнорировать. Общая форма луча эллиптическая или прямоугольная, но
ее можно округлить парой призм.
<p>
Свет таких лазерных диодов с торцевым излучением в основном линейно поляризован.
Вы можете легко подтвердить это даже простой лазерной указкой, отразив ее под
углом около 45 градусов от куска стекла (не зеркала с металлическим покрытием).
Вращайте указку и следите за отражением - будут четко различимые минимум и максимум,
когда длинная ось пучка близка к параллельной и перпендикулярной стеклу, соответственно.
В качестве дополнительного упражнения определите угол Брюстера. :)
<p>
Дополнительную информацию ищите в разделе <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diobcc0">"Beam
Characteristics of Laser Diodes"</A>.
<p>
Луч из заднего конца кристалла лазерного диода попадает на встроенный фотодиод,
который обычно используется для оптоэлектронной цепи обратной связи, регулирующей
ток и тем самым мощность луча. Обратите внимание, что фотодиод скорее всего
расположен под углом (невозможно показать в ASCII-картинке), так что отражение
от него не мешает работе лазерного диода.
<p>
ПРЕДУПРЕЖДЕНИЕ: Некоторые законченные лазерные модули могут использовать отражения
от внешней оптики вместе с отдельным фотодиодом для стабилизации мощности,
поскольку это более точно за счет измерения фактического выходного луча. В таких
схемах никогда нельзя пытаться почистить или даже подрегулировать линзу при работе
вблизи полной мощности, поскольку это нарушит цепь обратной связи и повредит лазер.

<h3><A NAME="dioilds">Чтение характеристик лазерных диодов</A></h3>

Вот основные параметры, которые перечисляются в справочных листках заводов-изготовителей

Описание параметров приведено ниже:

<ul>
<li>Пороговый ток (Threshold current) - Наименьший ток, при котором имеет место
 лазерная генерация. Обратите внимание, что минимум не указан - некоторые
 экземпляры могут начать работать при токе меньше указанного.
<p>
<li>Рабочий ток (Operating current) - Ток, дающий выходную мощность 5 мВт (в этом примере).
 Обратите внимание на широкий диапазон - 10 мА. Это причина того, что невозможно
 просто установить ток резистором или стабилизатором. Весь диапазон выходной мощности
 от 0 мВт до разрушения лазера покрывается этим диапазоном токов - фактическое
 поведение зависит от конкретного экземпляра и от температуры.
<p>
<li>Рабочее напряжение (Operating voltage) - Напряжение на лазерном диоде при указанном
 рабочем токе. Вероятно, это нужно знать только для того, чтобы иметь возможность
 получить максимальное рабочее напряжение в вашей схеме. <b>НЕВОЗМОЖНО</b> сделать
 блок питания лазера на основе одного лишь рабочего напряжения.
<p>
<li>Длина волны (Wavelength) - Выходная длина волны может отличаться от экземпляра к
 экземпляру и меняться с температурой. Такие лазерные диоды нельзя использовать как
 источники образцовой длины волны!
<p>
<li>Угол излучения (Radiation angle) - Расходимость луча параллельно (горизонтально)

<h3><A NAME="diocss7">Как насчет мощных лазерных диодов видимого диапазона?</A></h3>

Есть возможность приобретси лазерные диоды с мощностью 0.5 Вт и более:
<p>
<blockquote>
"Я вот просматривал сайт <A HREF="http://www.mi-lasers.com/">Meredith
 Instrument's</A> и заметил что у них есть  635 nm диоды с заявленной мощностью 
 500 мВт. Имел ли кто-либо с ними дело? Судя по сайту, оказывается, что я могу
 купить диод на полватта за менее чем 600$, или a 250 мВт меньше чем за $400.  
 Есть ли какие-либо особенности в их использовании? Готовая лазерная установка может получиться
 дешевле гелий-неонового лазера на 25 мВт". 
</blockquote>
<p>
Да, кроме того что эти дорогостоящие диоды с лёгкостью могут быть выведены из
строя при использовании неподходящего драйвера, качество их луча и рядом не стояло
с таковым у дешёвого гелий-неонового лазера. Луч многомодовый, некруглый с сильным 
астигматизмом. Последнее может быть исправлено с помощью дорогостоящей оптики. 
Многомодовость этого лазера означает что он не подходит для использования в голографии и интерферометрии.
<p>
(Прислал от: Frank DeFreitas (director@holoworld.com).)
<p>
У меня есть 500 мВт лазерный диод фирмы Polaroid, похоже на 660 нм. Ему нужен 
довольно сложный драйвер, предлагаемый фирмой Meredith -- тот который способен
отдать ток 1000 мА или около того. Лазерный диод многомодовый, так что можно 
забыть о таких применениях где нужна хорошая когерентность. 
<p>
Выходной луч обычно имеет профиль в форме линии. Это очень похоже на то, как
луч стандартного гелий-неонового лазера пропускают через цилиндрическую линзу. 
(С другой стороны я предполагаю что цилиндричеаская линза поможет скорректировать форму 
пучка. По крайней мере она даст возможность фокусировки пучка с помощью дополнитлеьной оптики) 
<p>
Я бы также хотел подчеркнуть что это не тот диод с которым стоит играться 
направо и налево. Выходная мощность составляет 500 мВт, и хотя он не будет 
сбивать ракеты в небе, нужно соблюдать большую осторожность при работе с его
лучом. Луч гораздо мощнее чем, кажется, так как чувствительность глаза к длине волны
660 нм гораздо ниже чем к 632.8 нм от гелий-неонового лазера сравнимой мощности.
<h3><A NAME="diocss7a">А очень мощных лазерных диодов?</A></h3>
Вы можете прочитать о действительно высокомощных лазерных диодах -- с выходной
мощностью измеряемой ВАТТами, десятками ВАТТ, или даже сотнями ВАТТ с одиночного
диода или линейки диодов, или набора линеек. Как правило это излучатели ближнего
ИК диапазона, на 808 нм. Твердотельные лазеры с диодной накачкой (известные как DPSS)
используют эти источники света для накачки с мощностью порой 1000 Вт (и со временем 
эта мощность повышается). 
Также смотрите раздел  <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Твердотельные лазеры с диодной накачкой</A>.
<p>
О линейках лазерных диодов:
<p>
(Прислал: Walter Skrlac (Walter.Skrlac@t-online.de).)
<p>
<blockquote>
"Линейки диодов -- это обычно сборка шириной 10 мм из 16-24 излучателей, каждый из которых
примерно 150 микрон в поперечнике и излучает до 2 Вт мощности. У линейки для накачки
твердотельного лазера бывает мощность до 40 Вт, с 19 излучателей. Как правило линейки -- это 
матрица излучателей. Я помню, что на раннем этапе Siemens выпустил линейку на 5 Вт 
состоявшую из 5 отдельных лазерных диодов по 1 Вт составленных в ряд длиной 10 мм.
Отдельные диоды соединены параллельно и не могут управляться\переключаться по отдельности"
</blockquote>
<p>
Хорошие новости таковы, что технология развивается очень быстро.
<p>
Плохие новости таковы, что на текущий момент пока нет перспективы найти источники где такие 
диодные лазеры можно купить дёшево в состоянии нового или б\у. Тем не менее, цены быстро 
падают. Стоимость новых диодов 1 Вт 808 нм уже упала ниже 100$ и при должной удаче на 
eBay можно найти намного дешевле
<p>
На самом деле, собственно сам диод не настолько дорогой. Диод на 1.5 Вт 800 нм
стоит около 10$ при условии что покупается в больших количестве. Кристалл диода 
имеет размер всего 0.5 мм в поперечнике и толщину 0.1 мм. Установка состоит в припайке
кристалла низкотемпературным припоем к радиатору и припайке медной полоски для подвода
электроэнергии. (Фотодиода встроеного нет, его нужно устанавливать отдельно). Пайка
выполняется путем точно контролированного нагрева радиатора почти до температуры плавления
припоя и подпайки тонким паяльником. У кристалла есть сторона глухого зеркала и сторона выходного,
есть верх и низ, поэтому его ориентация имеет значение. Так что если у Вас есть 
доступ к паяльной станции для СМД компонентов, бинокулярный микроскоп, твердая рука, бесконечное
терпение и Вы не чихаете (чих может сдуть черте-куда Ваши кристаллы, где их Вы никогда не найдёте),
то Вы можете попробовать. У меня есть несколько кристаллов, если я соберусь с духом это
попробовать, я сообщу о результате.   
<p>
Гораздо проще с лазерынми диодами иметь дело, когда они уже закреплены на радиаторе.
Но тогда стоимость приближается к 100$. Лучший вариант -- приборести готовый модуль с 
волоконным выходом. Тогда не нужно заморачиваться с формированием излучения, диод надежно
спрятан от вреда окружающей среды, а волоконный выход позволит его идеально адаптировать
к подходящему активному кристаллу твердотельного лазера. Часть мощности теряется на волокне,
но обычно я видел что характеристики "голых" линеек и модулей с волоконным выходом 
почти одинаковы. Но стоимость такого модуля весело приближается к стоимости хорошо 
нафаршированного ПК. :) для дополнитлеьной информации смотрите раздел: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diofcld">Анатомия лазерных 
диодов с волоконным выходом</A>.
<p>
Учтите что большинство высокомощных диодов работают в ближнем ИК -- порядка 800 нм
для накачки DPSS лазеров или 830-870 нм. Мощные диоды видимого диапазона распространены гораздо
хуже и их мощность обычно менее 1 Вт на длине волны 670 нм. Это ужасно. :)
<p>
Если они близки Вашему сердцу и желаете получить такой лазерный диод на свой день рождения, 
то все что я могу предложить на текущий момент -- это регулярно изучать ассортимент 
интернет-барахолок и производителей, список которых приведен здесь:
<A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Источники лазеров и запчастей</A>. Они всплывают на eBay,
но точность описания и состояние может быть неизвестно. Если это нужно для академического
(курсового\дипломного) проекта с определённой целью исследований -- то можно выпросить брак 
(допустим, с косметическими дефектами) у производителей при условии проявления некоторой 
настойчивости. Или же, если Вы умеете работать с кристаллами, можно попробовать выпросить немного
у производителей DPSS лазеров, посокльку они закупают их машинами и стоимость сильно падает.
<p>
Помните, что получить сам диод -- это лишь малая часть проблемы. Для получения надежной работы на максимуме мощности
нужен подходящий источник тока для питания лазерных диодов (драйвер) и адекватное охлаждение. 
При соблюдении правил предосторожности, не выходя за допустимые пределы по питанию,
сжечь мощный диод гораздо труднее чем маломощный.
<p>
Ну и при таких мощностях излучения у Ваших глаз (и горючих объектов) нет шансов на восстановление. 
Лазерная безопасность должна быть на первом месте.
<p>
<h3><A NAME="diocss7b">А что это за мощные импульсные лазерные диоды?</A></h3>
Вы, возможно, видели в продаже ИК лазерные диоды с заявленной выходной мощностью 9 или 14 Вт или иной 
мощности которая выглядит слишком высокой чтобы выглядеть правдоподобно. Дело в том, что указанная 
мощность реализуется в <i>импульсном</i> режиме и это <i>пиковая</i> мощность. Эти б\у лазерные диоды
являются деталью лазерного дальномера из танка Chieftain. Они обычно не были сильно дорогими (от 20 до 100$).
К сожалению, не смотря на то, что они имеют высокую пиковую мощность, средняя обычно не первышает
нескольких мВт, поскольку работают в повторно-кратковременном режиме с очень малой ПВ (продолжитлеьность включения) -- обычно 0.1%.
Более того, длина их волны обычно между 850 и 910 нм, что не сильно интересно для большинства применений. 
(Бывает, что попадаются диоды с длиной волны от 780 до 980 нм). Нет никакой возможности произвести
эффективное удвоение частоты излучения для получения видимого света. (Хотя, если хорошо сфокусировать
луч под хитрым углом внутри КТР кристалла -- может и можно увидеть пару синих фотонов). Для накачки
широко используемых кристаллов для твердотельных лазеров эти диоды тоже не годятся. Подходят они
разве что для дальномеров и подобных применений.
<p>
Эти лазерные диоды поставляются в пластиковом корпусе, похожи на обычные светодиоды, поэтому у них
нет возможности нормально охлаждаться вообще, в то время как возможность рассеивания мощности является
главным ограничивающим фактором в работе такого диода. Возможно применять меньшую величину импульсного
тока при большей длительности импульса, что не прописано в даташите, но нужно следить за тем чтобы
не превышалась допустимая мощность рассеяния. Но так как пороговый ток таких диодов высокий, то толку от
них все равно мало. И никаких гарантий.
 <p>
 Некоторая информация по драйверам импульсных лазерных диодов находится здесь: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpspld">Драйверы импульсных лазерных диодов</A>.
<p>
 Дальше пойдет речь об устройстве с пиковой мощностью 16 Вт, длительностью импульса 100 нс и ПВ 0.1%:
<p>
(Прислал: Roithner Lasertechnik" (office@roithner-laser.com).) 
<p>
Абсолютным пределом является тепловая нагрузка на кристалл ЛД. При нормальных условиях лазер будет
выдавать импульс мощностью 16 Вт при длительности импульса 100 нс и частоте повторения 10 кГц.(200 нс и 5 кГц -- абсолютный предел)-- 
который рекомендуется для сохранения большого срока службы в несколько тысяч часов с естественной деградацией кристалла. 
Сделав произведение V*I (умножаем ток на напряжение) можно получить величину тепловой рассеиваемой мощности. Если увеличить частоту 
повторения импульсов, а длительность уменьшить, то величина рассеиваемой мощности останется неизменной. Если её превысить -- мощность
лазерного импульса будет быстро уменьшаться из-за перегрева кристалла (это обратимо, кристалл ещё не сгорел) и дальнейший 
срок службы существенно сократится. Время нарастания и спада тока на диоде обычно в пределах 1 нс.
<h3><A NAME="diocss8">Лазерные диоды с вертикальным резонатором (VCSEL)</A></h3>
Большая часть лазерных диодов что существуют (и обсуждаются в этом документе) являются "краевыми" излучателями -- 
луч выводится с торца кристалла лазерного диода. Они также называются диоды типа "Фабри-Перо", так как их 
резонатор очень похож на таковой у обычного газового или твердотельного лазера, но сформирован внутри
полупроводникового кристалла лазерного диода. Зеркала образованы отколотыми краями обработанного кристалла
или (в мощных, высокостабильных или перестраиваемых) края кристалла просветлены и кристалл установлен во внешний резонатор.
<p>
VCSELs излучают с верхней поверхности кристалл (и частично с нижней). Резонатор получается за счет чередования около сотни слоёв
отражающих и слоёв активного полупроводника, сформированных с помощью эпитаксии на подложке
<p>
Этот подход предоставляет ряд сильных преимуществ:
<ul>
<li>Характеристики излучения --
  Работой  VCSEL можно управлять, или по крайней мере на неё можно влиять, выбирая количество и 
  толщину зеркальных слоёв, или изменяя другие параметры в процессе производства.
  Потенциальные возможности тонкой настройки при такой технологи трудно представить. VCSEL работают на одной продольной моде, но
  возможно с несколькими поперечными модами излучения.
  <p>
<li>Форма и профиль излучения - 
  В то время как обычные ФП лазерные диоды имеют излучающую поверхность размером 1*3 мкм (они всегда такие длинные и тонкие -- p-n переход,
  в котором идет процесс излучения имеет практически нулевую толщину), форма излучающей области VCSEL может быть сделана какой угодно
  для того или иного применения -- в форме кольца, например, для оптимального согласования с входным торцом многомодового оптического волокна.
  <p>
  Луч типичного лазера с вертикальным резонатором выходит из круглой области оыбчно от 5 до 25 мкм в диаметре. Поскольку излучающая 
  область большего размера, то результирующая расходимость меньше. И поскольку луч круглый -- ему не требуется коррекция
  ассиметрии или астигматизма -- простая линза обеспецит отличную фокусировку.
  <p>
<li>Более низкий порог генерации и рабочий ток. Типичный диод для коммуникаций или CD имеет пороговый ток около 30 мА,
в то время как пороговый ток VCSEL может составлять 1-2 мА! Это приводит к меньшему потреблению энергии, более
скоростной модуляции, более простой схемотехнике драйвера, меньшим радиопомехам. Также они более "дубовы" относитлеьно питания -- 
достаточно управления током без оптической обратной связи, которая требуется другим маломощным диодам для избежания
самоуничтожения (КОП -- Кататстрофическое Оптическое Повреждение), которое может произойти за 1-2 наносекунды при превышении 
пиковой оптической мощности на площадке 1*3 мкм. У лазеров с вертикальным резонатором размер этой площадки намного больше, так что
КОП для них не является особой проблемой.
<p>
<li>Реализацая массивов VCSEL становится тривиальной. Все что необходимо -- это разрезать
кремниевую пластину на блоки совместно изготовленных лазеров пригодных для работы и 
упаковать их в одиночный корпус. Плотность упаковки таких диодов может превысить плотность упаковки 
обычных ФП диодов (см. ниже). Это существенное преимущество при конструировании высокоскоростных 
оптических шин и соединений.
</ul>
<p>
Tакже есть преимущества у этих диодов в цене и более простом производстве
<p>
<ul>
<li>Меньший размер -- в то время как ФП резонатор краевого излучателя имеет длинц 250-500 мкм,
общий размер VCSEL потенциально ограничен только размерами излучающей области и местом для электрических контактов.
Таким образом "штамп" для готвоого VCSEL может быть лишь немногим больше размера выходного луча. Имеющиеся в доступе 
устройства с круглым лучом диаметром 25 мкм имеют размер всего 100 мкм в поперечнике, и этот размер может быть уменьшен до
50 мкм или даже меньше. Меньший размер приводит к большему количественному выходу диодов с одной кремниевой заготовки
и меньшей стоимости отдельного диода и больших плотностях упаковки в лазерном массиве.
<p>
<li>Упрощённое производство -- ФП лазерные диоды должны быть вырезаны из заготовки (и возможно установлены на подложку) только
для проверки на работоспособность и отбраковки. Они не могут быть проверены пока не вырезаны из заготовки, поскольку края ещё не
сформированы. Это дорогой времязатратный процесс, в ходе которого трата усилий и материалов может получиться напрасной.
<p>
  Здесь же вся заготовка с произведёнными на ней лазерами с вертикальным резонатором может быть испытана
  без вырезания из неё отдельных кристаллов на порог генерации и мощность, форму луча, качество, 
  стабильность. Есть возможность сформировать милионы лазеров на одной заготовке совместно, а потом испытать и оценить
  производитлеьность каждого в автоматическом режиме. Вся заготовка может пройти стресс-испытания чтобы 
  устранить "детские болезни" и повысить надежность финального продукта. На основании этого потом каждый лазер может быть 
  корпусирован или выброшен.
<p>
<li>Упрощённое крепление к подложке и корпусирование. По сути для этого может применяться такое же оборудование как и для
  производства других интегральных схем, так как лазер с вертикальным резонатором крепяться плоскостью к плоской подложке и 
  излучают через окно как в EPROM микросхемах (только окно хорошего оптического качества или же лазер может быть состыкован
  с оптическим волокном, если это нужно). Так как излучающая облатсь полупроводника вместе с её зеркалами "погребены" под 
  поверхностными слоями, то герметичная упаковка не требуется. VCSEL могут упаковываться в недорогие пластиковые корпуса
  и\или скомбинированы с другими оптическими компонентами как гибридная микросборка. Все эти приемы уменьшают итоговую стоимость продукта. 
</ul>
<p>
Технология лазеров с вертикальным резонатором ещё находится в своем "детстве" и её потенциал только начинает использоваться.
Вполне возможно, что VCSEL станут преобладающим типом лазерных диодов в будущем с совершенно фантастическими возможностями и стоимостю настолько
низкой что сегодня это сложно себе представить. Техническая информация доступна на следующих сайтах:

Если Вам хочется поиграться с VCSEL, "голыми" кристаллами, корпусированными кристаллами, или даже
массивами VCSEL, то они могут быть доступны у некоторых поставщиков лазеров по не слишком смехотворным
ценам. Например:
<A HREF="http://www.roithner-laser.com/VCSELs.htm">Roithner Lasertechnik's
VCSEL Page</A>.  Доступные длины волн в данныей момент -- 780, 850, 980 нм, но ещё доступны длины волн более 1300 нм
у других поставщиков и этот диапазон расширяется в обе стороны.
<p>
Если Вы подозреваете, что один из Ваших лазерных диодов является лазером с вертикальным резонатором,
но не уверены в этом -- проверьте форму лазерного пучка. Выходной пучок VCSEL будет симметричным, тогда как
у обычного диода пучок неравномерно расходится по сторонам с примерным соотношением 4:1 как обсуждалось выше. 
<p>
Также существует нечто называемое "Светодиод с оптическим резонатором", что по сути является светодиодом помещённым между двух зеркал.
Эти ухищрения приводят к появлению вынужденного излучения со структурой содержащей продольные моды, но усиления недостаточно 
для начала генерации лазерного излучения. Я не уверен что эти устройства имеют кардинальные отличия от VCSEL. Описано это в следующей статье:

вполне может применяться излучение другого лазера для оптической накачки. Это имеет преимущества в том случае если нужно 
управлять модовым составом и формой пучка излучения.
<p>
Первым таким лазером, который стал серийно выпускаться фирмой Coherent, Inc., стал лазер "Сапфир", разработанный для замены
маломощных аргон-ионных лазеров с длиной волны 488 нм. (Я думаю, название "Сапфир" неудачно так как это устройство не имеет никакого
отношения к титан-сапфировым лазерам, с которыми он может быть перепутан). Сапфир это лазер с вертикальным внешним резонатором с оптической
накачкой. (Также смотрите следующий раздел). Резонатор напоминает таковой в твердотельных лазерах с диодной накачкой (DPSS), но внутри
него помещён кристалл InGaAs полупроводника вместо лазерного кристалла твердотельного лазера. Накачивается он мощным 808 нм диодом
и излучает основную линию 976 нм в ИК диапазоне. Затем из этого излучения генерируется вторая гармоника в виде 488 нм.
<p>
Смотрите <A HREF="http://www.coherentinc.com/">Coherent</A>, потом
"Lasers and Systems", "OPSL" для дополнительной информации.
<p>
Красота подхода OPSL заключается в том, что при соответствующем выборе материала и легирования, раочая среда -- полупроводниковый диск -- 
может излучать самые различные длины волн в диапазоне от 635 нм до 1500 нм и дальше. (Синие и ультрафиолетовые пока нежизнеспособны).
Таким образом весь диапазон длин волн, включая удвоенные частоты (генерация второй гармоники - ГВГ) и, возможно, высшие гармоники
доступны с качеством луча как у твердотельного лазера. Эта технология может ещё называться "Полупроводниковый Дисковый Лазер".
<p>
Некоторые другие фирмы разрабатывают лазеры путем похожего подхода, и лазерные системы с многими длинами волн, включая жёлтую\оранжевую
области из "нелазерной зоны" теперь или уже доступны или станут доступны в ближайшем будущем. Кроме того, иногда эти лазеры
называют "DPSS", хотя строго говоря они таковыми не являются в традиционном смысле. Вот несколько признаков
настоящего твердотельного DPSS-лазера:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Если длина волны лазера не является основной или удвоенной линией излучения для вандата, ИАГ, ИЛФ или другого
популярного лазерного кристалла, или не является суммарной\разностной частотой двух популярных длин волн
(например 593.5 нм), то это полупроводниковый лазер с удвоением частоты. 
<p>
<li>Если длина волны и/или ширина линии указана с точностью до малых долей нанометра -- то это DPSS.
Длина волны у полупроводниковых лазеров определяется в гораздо большей степени составом полупроводника и 
температурой, поэтому "488 нм" не будет точно соответствовать 488 нм, а будет гулять туда-сюда примерно на 1 нм.
</ul>
<p>
Хотя первый полупроводниковый лазер с внешним резонатором имеет оптическую накачку, как Coherent Sapphire,
он также может накачиваться электрическим током как обычный лазерный диод (таким образом в устройстве получаетс только один лазер -- 
без других лазерных диодов накачки) и упоминается в следующем подразделе. Теперь, многие компании применяют 
прямое удвоение частоты излучения лазерного диода, вводя излучение в нелинейный кристалл вне лазерного резонатора,
к примеру периодически поляризованный ниобат лития (ППЛН) или КТП (ППКТП). Это, возможно, не так эффективно для 
высокомощных лазров, но в области десятков мВт это намного проще. 
<h3><A NAME="diovecs">Vertical Extended Cavity Surface Emitting Laser
 (VECSEL)</A></h3>

This is very similar to the OPSL, above, but uses electrical pumping
similar to a conventional edge-emitting laser diode or VCSEL.  However,
the extended cavity allows frequency doubling to be performed much like
in the OPSL with an external OC mirror and intracavity non-linear
crystal.  These lasers are direct competition to the OPSL and not
surprisingly, have been introduced with similar wavelengths and output
powers.  One company that was a leader in this area was
Novalux
<p>
Two relevant patents (listed on a Novalux laser) are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>U.S. Patent #6,243,407:</b> High Power Laser Device</A>
<li><b>U.S. Patent #6,404,797:</b> Efficiany High Power Laser Device</A>
</ul>
<p>
But Novalux seems to have ceased production of these
lasers as end-user products and are concentrating on OEM applications
like light sources for large screen TVs and portable projectors.  The Novalux
Web site is gone.  However, there is an overly fluffy Web site for
<A HREF="http://necsel.com/">NECSEL</A> with information on
the technology and applications.  It's not clear how much of it is real
though.  But imagine buying replacement multi-watt RGB laser modules at
consumer electronics prices or salvaging them from broken TVs! :)  And other
manufacturers are developing similar technology, so there will be competition.

<h4><A NAME="diopr488">Novalux Protera Model 488-5 NECSEL Laser</A></h4>

This is a 5 mW (rated), 488 nm laser system.  One configuration is
shown in <A HREF="pr488s1.jpg">Novalux Protera 488-5 NECSEL Laser System 1</A>
consisting of the laser head, a lab-style controller, and a 5 VDC
power pack.  In addition to the laser head connector, there is also
a socket for an interlock (just a shorted 1/8" mono phone plug), and
a "DATA" connector.  There are also 5 LEDS: Power, Temperature Lock,
Laser On, Laser Lock, and Error.  I could not find anything like RS232
levels on the DATA connector, even though it only has pins 2 and 3 wired
to the main PCB, and pin 5 to Ground.  This suggests that it is intended
for RS232, though these controllers have it receive-only, dead, or
never enabled.  I would have expected a negative voltage
on pins 2 or 3 but they both read 0 V, though they are connected to
something (from ohmmeter checks).   Except for the Laser
Head connector, everything else is on a mezzanine PCB that attaches
to the main PCB via power and signal cables.
<p>
Other configurations include at least two different types of OEM controllers.
One is a shorter silver box with no LEDs or switches, but with a Molex
connector labeled DATA.  See <A HREF="pr488s2.jpg">Novalux Protera 488-5
NECSEL Laser System 2</A>.  The main PCB inside is identical (except
possibly the revision) for the two controllers.  For the lab controller,
the Power and Data connectors are replaced by the inter-PCB cables.
<p>
The pinout of the 10 pin Molex connector called DATA on the small controller
and the similar Molex connector between the main and mezzanine PCBs in the
lab controller is as follows:
<p>

</PRE>
<p>
Unfortunately, although the inter-PCB connectors are the correct type,
their sex is wrong!  So it isn't possible to simply swap in the mezzanine
PCB to the small controller to test it.  Why did they do that?  However,
all that should be needed is to jumper the Interlock pin to Ground.
(And indeed this seems to have the expected effect, more below.)
<p>
The third type of controller is a black box with a switch
labeled "TEC/Off/On".  See <A HREF="pr488c3.jpg">Novalux Protera Laser
Controller Type 3<</A> and the inside at <A HREF="pr488c3i.jpg">Novalux
Protera Laser Controller Type 3 Interior View</A>.
<p>
For the system I am testing, the laser head may be good, though more likely
it is at least somewhat sick.  The only controller that does anything
other than turn on the power LED (if present) is the black one.  With
the interlock chain completed, both of the others do exactly nothing
beyond turning on the Power LED.  Turning the keylock switch to Off or
removing the interlock plug or flipping the keylock switch to Off
turns on the Error LED.  Nothing else happens even
after a loooong wait.  So, either both controllers are basically
similarly dead, the laser head is broken in some way that is
preventing them from going beyond power on, or they are expecting
a command via the RS232 port (assuming it IS an RS232 port) or
some other signal designed to confuse people like us who are
trying to get these lasers to work without factory authorized
documentation!
<p>
After Steve Roberts had mentioned a Novalux control CD in a post on
alt.lasers, I connected a PC to the DATA connector suspecting that perhaps
it was just asleep until tickled by an input on the RCV pin.  And, indeed,
it IS RS232, apparently at 19.2 kBaud.  (All other speed choices result in
either nothing or gibberish.)  But the only response I can get so far is
"Syntax Error" possibly echoing some of the (random) characters I was
typing, and that very sporadically.  Stay tuned.
<p>
However, by using the black controller, the laser head does at least
produce some blue light - between 0.01 mW and 3 mW depending
on its mood, the setting of the left-hand pot and a mystery switch (partially
hidden by the white wires to the power transistor) inside
the black controller.  It probably tries to optimize the output power
(or something) but that's not working correctly on this laser.  It seems
to try sometimes but eventually loses lock ending up at less than 1 mW
(sometimes much less than 1 mW) and a multi-spatial mode beam profile.
<p>
Then I realized there were 2 other pots next to the TEC drivers.  (How could
I have missed them???  One is hidden by the larger orange capacitor but
it's still in full view when in person!  Adjusting the one in the lower
left corner finally had a dramatic effect - resulting in an output power
of up to 14 mW with a decent beam profile.  The other pot didn't seem
to do anything.  The laser is
still not stable.  It won't hold constant output power without fiddling
with the pots every few minutes regardless of the mystery switch position,
but it doesn't drop suddenly to 0.01 mW anymore.  However, even with the
fiddling, the power eventually continues to decline.  If turned off for
awhile and restarted, much of the power comes back if the pots are readjusted,
but for only a short time.
Since two of four pots still don't seem to have any detectable effect,
there are several possibilities including (1) the controller is broken,
(2) the laser head is broken, (3) both are broken, (4) the two non-functioning
pots adjust parameters for some other laser that uses the same controller,
and (5) I still have no clue about how to set this up!
<p>
From power-on, there is a delay of a minute or so before any blue light
emerges, and then another 2 or 3 minutes before the pot has any effect,
indicating a warmup or initialization period.
<p>
The laser head bears some similarity in construction to JDSU uGreen lasers,
including a flex-PCB with a few components on it.  Here are 4 view:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="pr488ls.jpg">Novalux Protera Model 488-5 Laser Head - Left Side View</A>

<li><A HREF="pr488rb.jpg">Novalux Protera Model 488-5 Laser Head - Right Back View</A>
</ul>
<p>
The VECSEL/NECSEL is inside the copper object.  There must be a small
fast TEC for cavity length control, adjustable in part via that pot.  It
has only a few connections, probably laser diode power, TEC, and temperature
sensor.
<p>
There is a large TEC under the copper object.  The black assembly only has a
beam power sensor, IR-blocking filter, and output optics.

<h3><A NAME="diofddl">Frequency Doubling a Diode Laser</A></h3>

Using a non-linear crystal to double the optical frequency (halve the
wavelength) of a laser diode directly is generally very difficult due to the
low power density of even a high power laser diode, and the poor beam
quality.  Even a 5 mW green laser pointer using an diode pumped
intracavity frequency doubled solid state laser can have WATTs of
circulating power with an intracavity mode diameter of less than
0.1 mm.  Furthermore, that intracavity mode is nicely parallel over
a large portion of the doubling crystal which facilitates phase matching
to it.  Attempting something similar with a laser diode, and especially
a high power laser diode, is extremely difficult if not impossible.
Shining enough IR at a piece of KTP or LBO might get you a few uW
of doubled blue or green, but nothing worth writing home about.
However, one technique that has been attempted commercially is the
use of an resonant doubling cavity as described in the next section.
The diode output is coupled into an external resonant cavity with no gain
medium but with a non-linear crystal and mirrors that are highly reflective
at the IR wavelength of the laser diode.  When the
resonance condition is satisfied, the power inside the cavity can
become very large.  The cavity design controls the mode diameter inside
the doubling crystal so that this side-steps the two original problems
with doubling of diode lasers.  Making it work reliably in a commercial
product is another story since many conditions need to be satisfied at
the same time.

<h4><A NAME="diocod3">Coherent D3 (Directly Doubled Diode) 430 nm Laser</A></h4>

The Coherent D3 (which actually should be D<sup>3</sup> but that's kind of a
pain to do everywhere!) uses a single mode 860 nm laser diode feeding an
external resonant doubling cavity to generate a perhaps up to 30 mW of output
at a wavelength of 430 nm.  According to the specifications, the output
is single frequency (single longitudinal mode) with a coherence length
of around 6 meters, making it suitable for holography and other similar
applications.
<p>
The D3 was developed in the late 1990s when there
were no low cost (relatively speaking!) ways of generating 430 nm.  This must
be the most complex low power laser ever attempted and apparently never worked
quite right.  It must have also cost a fortune to develop and then technology
passed it by since it's now possible to obtain 430 nm directly from a GaN
laser diode, or from a frequency doubled optically or electrically pumped
external cavity vertical surface emitting laser diode, both of which
are considerably simpler technologies to reproduce (once all the
hard research and development has been completed!).  (See the sections
starting with: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioopsl">Optically Pumped Semiconductor
Laser (OPSL)</A>.)
<p>
For a long time I believed the D3 never went into production
at all, but apparently it did, or almost did as I have a couple samples
that are definitely beyond the prototype stage - nice control electronics
with no cuts and jumpers on the PCBs, and an optics construction technique
that is very similar to that of the C532.
<p>
The complexity arises from the need to precisely match the doubler cavity
resonance to the wavelength of the 860 nm laser diode as well as phase
matching the doubling crystal and maintaining all of this stable for
a useful amount of time!  Of the 2 of these I know of that work, both
are temperamental.

Coherent D3 430-10 Gallery Page</A>.  It's quite obvious that the laser
I have is of the same heritage as his, but has been extensively refined
in terms of the electronics and optics.  And Ben's is almost certainly
a prototype based on the extensive rework that is evident in the photos.
<p>
<b>Principles of operation</b>
<p>
As best as I can determine so far, here is how it works:  The Laser Diode
generates about 100 mW of 860 nm with a single spatial mode.  Beam correction
optics generate a beam that is well mode-matched to the doubler
cavity.  The Optical Isolator assures that there will be no back
reflections into the laser diode to destabilize lasing.  A low level RF
signal modulates the amplitude of the laser diode output.  The Laser Diode
is temperature controlled both to keep it cool and to fine tune the
wavelength.
<p>
The resonant doubler consists of 4 mirrors in a bow-tie configuration
with a MgO:LiNbO3 frequency doubling crystal heated to approximately 107 &deg;
on its own TEC in the upper path.  The High Speed IR Sensor (photodiode, but
note the rigid mini-coax connection) monitors the reflected
beam from the entrance mirror of the cavity.  A synchronous demodulator
(lock-in amplifier or phase sensitive detector) then uses the PZT to
maximize to tune the cavity length to maximize the intra-cavity IR beam
power.
<p>
The temperature of the doubling crystal is optimized to provide the
proper phase matching for maximum blue conversion.
<p>
Note that while the bow-tie cavity has the topology of a ring, it has
no gain and thus is inherently unidirectional based on how the input
beam is introduced, in this case resulting in right-to-left travel
in both horizontal legs.  Thus, assuming that the OC mirror (upper
left) is high transmission for 430 nm, the blue light builds up in power from
right-to-left inside the doubling crystal and exits the cavity without
reflecting from any mirrors.  So the cavity only needs to be resonant for
860 nm to maximize the intra-cavity IR power, and thus the blue power.
It's possible that the component labeled "Low Speed IR Sensor" monitors
the intracavity IR power via its leakage through the upper right
mirror.  This all requires fancy footwork because the IR power will
decrease as a rsult of optimum phase matching in the doubling crystal,
and thus maximum blue light.
<p>
In some ways, this is similar to the operation of the Lightwave Model
142 laser with its resonant doubler.  But that doubler is a monolithic
crystal whose temperature increases with the amount of intra-cavity
power.  Thus, the tuning must be approached from one direction to
catch and ride the wave, so to speak, as the intra-cavity power builds up.
Here, the only part of the bow-tie cavity that will be affected is
the doubling crystal itself, which is relatively small as far as
its effect on the cavity length.  So, simply peaking the blue power
may be sufficient, rather than the more complex algorithm of the LWE-142.
(For more information on the LWE-142, see the section:

<li>Resonant Doubler Bow-Tie Cavity length to resonate at 860 nm.  (Maximize
 intracavity 860 nm power.)

<b>Power</b>
<p>
Powering the OEM D3 laser is very straightforward - just 4
DC power supplies to the small white connector (J2 PWR).
<p>
<PRE>
  Pin    Function   I Max
 -----------------------------------
   1     +5 VDC     2.0  A

   7     -15 VDC    0.2  A
   8     Ground
</PRE>
<p>
Since this isn't a high power laser, the current requirements are
relatively low, though finding an inexpensive commercial power supply
with all 4 voltages may be a challenge.  Deriving the -5 VDC from the
-15 VDC supply with a 3 terminal regulator may simplify this.
The only problem is that the connector isn't that common.  The PCB
connectors are Molex right angle fully shrouded headers, series 5268NA,
part numbers 22-05-7155 (J1, 15 pin) and 22-05-7155 (J2, 8 pin).
The mating connectors are Molex part numbers 50-37-5153 and 50-37-5083,
respectively.  The crimp pins are Molex part number 08-70-1040.  These
are all available from <A HREF="http://www.mouser.com/">Mouser</A>.

                                  corresponds to 10 mW of blue.)
</PRE>
<p>
The minimum connections to get the laser to operate are to jumper pins 1 to 2
(Interlock) and pins 5 to 9 (Automatic Cavity Relock).  To check diode
health, monitor between pins 7 (EoL signal) and 7 (GND).  When new, this
voltage should be several volts positive, declining as the diode ages.
0 V is considered end-of-life, though the laser may not actually lose
lock until it goes somewhat negative.  For a diode near end-of-life,
as the laser warms up, the EoL voltage will oscillate slightly as the cavity
expands as a result of mode sweep and the controller resorts to increasing
diode current to maintain lock.  The p-p amplitude may be up to 1 V or
more with a time scale of 10s of seconds.

There are also many test points on the PCBs, most of them labeled.

<b>Tests of a D3 laser</b>
<p>
I have two of these lasers.  One was known to have an annoying rattle
and so I didn't expect that to work at all.  The other was rattle-free,
so there was potential for it to do something.  However, initially, both
behaved exactly the same: All 5 LEDs came on initially and then the LDI
LED went out after about 30 seconds.  Nothing else happened no matter how
long the system was powered.  So, the laser cavity with the rattle was
opened and found to have had its glass substrate cracked in two places,
not unexpected since the metal cover was very well bashed on one corner.
The interior photos are of essentially that laser cavity.  Amazing what
a bit of MSPaint will do to cracks. :)
<p>
But then I noticed something strange on the other laser: There was
a shorting plug on the center coax, which is in parallel with the
laser diode.  This wasn't present on the smashed one I had been
examining.  It was likely there to prevent static damage or something.
But of course, it would prevent much of use from happening as well.
Once the plug was removed, that laser produced some very nice blue light
almost immediately after the LDI LED went off (which means that the
laser diode is on).  The output power went in cycles from dim to
bright over a minute or so, but would not lock.  However, the only
LEDs now on were PM and LL.  The output power simply climbed to a
maximum and fell back to a low level.  These lumps were perfectly symmetric
(unlike the behavior of the LWE-142).
<p>
So, I figured that perhaps the laser was unable to achieve the default maximum
power.  There is a way to control power, at least from full to one half power
via a 0 to 5 V input.  When that was attached to a variable DC power supply,
it was indeed possible to reach a point where the bright blue output
could be maintained and the PM LED then went out as well.  However,
it isn't stable based on meter readings.  It may be fluctuating by
50 percent but maintaining an average of over 3 mW.  Since these are 10 mW
(rated) lasers, perhaps the peaks hit 5 mW.  So far, adjustments
of NLOTS and LDT have had little effect.  Increasing LDIS (the laser diode
current) does allow the average output power at which the laser maintains some
degree of lock to be slightly higher, but not enough to be worthwhile
given how close it is already running to the rated laser diode current.
Under no conditions have I been successful at getting the LL LED to go out.
<p>
CAUTION: Later I found a jumper labeled: 1/2 Pwr.  This indeed does result
in the laser behaving the same way as with the pot set at 5 V by connecting
the +5 VDC power supply directly to the power control input pin when installed!
So, if there is also a pot for power control, turning it fully to 0 V shorts
out the power supply!  Couldn't they afford a 0.1 cent isolation resistor? :)
<p>
More to come.

<h3><A NAME="dioldlb">Laser Diode Light Bulbs?</A></h3>

Consider: Some commercially available high power laser diodes have an overall
conversion efficiency - electrical power in to optical power out - of over 50
percent.  Current research is attempting to boost this past 80 percent.
<p>
Now, if all the light bulbs in the World were replaced with these high
efficiency laser diodes mass produced in visible wavelengths, the
the energy crisis - at least with respect to electrical generating
and transmission capacity - would be over (or at least
greatly reduced as a here and now crisis), since it's been estimated that 50
percent of electricity usage goes into lighting and most of this is presently
highly inefficient.  Incandescent lamps are only about
5 percent efficient; halogen lamps around 7 to 10 percent; and fluorescents,
about 15 to 20 percent.  High brightness LEDS suitable for lighting
applications are advancing but are currently somewhere around halogen
lamps in efficiency (though under some conditions, LEDs at low power
may exceed 25 percent efficiency).  But, it's unlikely that the LED could
even match the laser diode due to the basic physics.
<p>
A side benefit of mass produced laser light bulbs might be that hobbyists'
access to high power lasers would be greatly improved! :)
<p>
Before you say that it would be too dangerous to have every table lamp using
a high power laser, it would be a relatively simple matter to mold a diffuser
onto the laser diode in such a way that it would be virtually impossible to
disassemble (sorry hobbyists but maybe if we lobby hard enough, a special
tool could be made available!) and then wouldn't be any more dangerous than
a common light bulb.
<p>
Aside from reducing the cost of high power laser diodes by about 3 or 4 orders
of magnitude, wavelength is a definite stumbling block that still needs to be
overcome before any of this could be practical.  Either
red, green, and blue laser diodes will need to be combined in a single
lamp assembly to produce something approaching white light or a combination
of high efficiency phosphors will be needed to convert near-UV to visible
light.  One can envision a lighting panel in standard sizes like 2x2 or 2x4
feet that replaced fluorescent ceiling fixtures but used less than 25 percent
of their power.  Or, CLLs (Compact Laser Lamps) that replaced incandescent or
compact fluorescent lamps.  Needless to say, high power multicolor or UV
laser diodes do not presently exist but a market measured in billions of
units compared to current usage of 10s of thousands could provide a lot of
incentive to develop them! :)

<h2>Beam Characteristics, Correction, Comparison with Other Lasers, Noise</h2>
<h3><A NAME="diobcc0">Beam Characteristics of Laser Diodes</A></h3>

Unlike the helium-neon and other common gas lasers (as well as most other
types of lasers), the raw output beam from an edge emitting (also called
Fabry-Perot or FP) laser diode (the most common and until recently, only
commercially available types) is highly divergent and suffers from two
asymmetries: astigmatism and an elliptical beam profile.  The beam is also
inherently linearly polarized.  These all follow directly from the shape of
the emitting aperture of the edge emitting laser diode end facet which is
highly elongated rather than circular.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Low power edge emitting diodes usually operate in a single spatial mode
  for both axes.  Edge emitting diodes more than about 100 mW are almost
  always multiple spatial mode in the slow (horizontal) axis, single mode
  in the fast (vertical) axis.  Although it may take some effort (see below),
  a single mode diode can be focused or collimated with diffraction limited
  performance in both axes.  This isn't possible even theoretically for a
  the slow axis of a multimode diode.
<p>
<li>The dimensions of the end-facet for a typical small index guided laser
  diode are around 1 um x 3 um.  However, for a high power gain guided laser
  diode, the long dimension may be 10 or even 100 um or more.
<p>
  The divergence angle (half of total), Theta, (in degrees) is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
                               Wavelength * 720
                   Theta = -------------------------
                            pi * pi * Beam Diameter
</PRE>
<p>
  At a wavelength of 670 nm, this works out to about 48 x 16 degrees for a
  1 um x 3 um emitter and 48 x 0.48 degrees for a 1 x 100 um emitter (compared
  to around 0.05 degrees for a 1 mm diameter beam from a 632.8 nm helium-neon
  laser).  However, since laser diodes with 100 um emitters are always multiple
  spatial mode, this low value of divergence will never be seen in practice.
  Such diodes tend to have similar divergence to that of single mode emitters.
<p>
  Note that since at least one of the dimensions of the end-facet is close to
  the wavelength that the laser diode emits - it may even be smaller - this
  simple equation is not very precise but typical low power laser diodes do
  produce beams with a divergence of around 10 x 30 degrees.
<p>
  Laser diode divergence will generally be given in terms of the Full Width Half
  Maximum (FWHM) in terms of output power, or "T full width".  At the 10% level,
  this may be more like 70 or 80 degrees than the 30 degrees in the
  specifications.
<p>
<li>This asymmetry in the X and Y dimensions of the emitting end-facet results
  in a beam with an elliptical profile.  Sometimes this may be described as
  wedge-shaped.  Instead of a point or circular source, it is a line or
  rectangle.  If you focus a laser diode (or laser pointer), the result will
  be elongated.  Due to slight differences in manufacture, the precise angles
  will not be exactly the same even for various samples from the same batch of
  laser diodes!
<p>
<li>The slight astigmatism of the laser diode follows directly from the unequal
  divergence.  Tracing the beam in the two dimensions back to an imaginary
  point source, it is easy to see that the location of this point source
  depends on the divergence angle - it is close to the facet for the wide
  divergence beam and further back for the narrow divergence beam.  The
  difference between these two locations is the specified astigmatism for
  the laser diode.  For a 5 mW laser diode, an astigmatism of 40 um may be
  typical.  As expected, the astigmatism for a high power laser diode is
  likely to be much larger than for the small CD player or visible types.
<p>
<li>The beam from edge emitting laser diodes is generally linearly polarized.
  Typical values for the polarization ratio of index guided laser diodes are
  50:1 to 100:1 and 30:1 for wide stripe laser diode arrays (compared to at
  least 500:1 for a common linearly polarized HeNe laser) with the electric
  field vector oriented parallel to the laser diode junction.  The polarization
  ratio is somewhat lower near the lasing threshold where there is significant
  contribution from spontaneously emitted light which is randomly polarized.
</ul>
<p>
For more information (and some medium weight math) on the beam characteristics
of common laser diodes, check the
<A HREF="http://www.powertechnology.com/">Power Technology, Inc.</A> Go to
"Resource Library", "White Papers".
<p>
There are ways of correcting for all of these artifacts with a single special
lens close to the laser diode itself.  For example,
<A HREF="http://www.blueskyresearch.com/">Blue Sky Research</A> offers
combined laser diodes and microlenses which they claim perform as well as
larger more expensive diode laser modules using various discrete lenses and
prisms to implement the beam correction.
<p>
Note that VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser diodes) need not
suffer from astigmatism and/or an elliptical beam profile since their emitting
aperture can be made to be perfectly symmetrical.  I would also expect them
not to need to be polarized for this reason as well.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diocss8">Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser Diodes
(VCSELs)</A>.

<h3><A NAME="diomldb">Measuring Laser Diode Beam Characteristics</A></h3>

(From: Gregory J. Whaley (gwhaley@tiny.net).)
<P>
At Philips we used three difference techniques to measure astigmatism in
laser diodes:

<ul>
<li>Collimate the beam and measure the total wavefront error using an
 interferometer (like what Wyko sells), then mathematically extract only
 the astigmatism portion from the total wavefront error.  Perhaps this is
 the most difficult method.
<p>
<li>Collimate the beam and send it to a shearing interferometer to measure
 collimation in one axis, and then rotate the interferometer 90 degrees
 and move the laser diode (a few microns) to re-collimate the beam.  This
 was a routine measurement upon which we relied day in and day out.  You
 can buy shearing interferometers these days (e.g., the
 <A HREF="http://www.thorlabs.com/">ThorLabs</A> "Collimeter").  We had to make
 our own back then.
<p>
<li>Focus the beam down to a spot and use the
<A HREF="http://www.photon-inc.com/">Photon Technologies</A> spot scanner to
measure the physical astigmatic distance.  They have an application note about
this.
</ul>
Not surprisingly, each technique would give slightly different numbers! :-)

<h3><A NAME="diobcc1">Correcting for Unwanted Laser Diode Beam
 Characteristics</A></h3>

The following applies to single spatial mode laser diodes like those in
laser pointers and laser diode modules.  With these, both axes may be
corrected to diffraction limited performance.  These are generally low
power laser diodes, up to about 200 mW (though not all are single mode).
<p>
Without any type of correction, the output of a bare laser diode is more like
that from a mediocre flashlight than what is normally thought of as a laser
source.  Some optics are needed to produce a reasonably well collimated beam
(like the one from a cheap laser pointer) and more sophisticated optics are
needed to provide optimal beam quality (which can be very good indeed).  Of
course, depending on the particular application, one or more of these so
called 'defects' may actually be considered desirable.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Divergence - A positive (convex) lens can be used to produce a collimated
  or focused beam.  However, without further correction, the beam profile will
  be elliptical or wedge shaped (rather than circular) and the focal distances
  in X and Y will not be the same due to the laser diode's astigmatism.
<p>
<li>Elliptical beam profile - A pair of wedge-shaped prisms can be used to
  circularize the spot shape.  By adjusting the relative orientations of the
  two prisms, it is fairly easy to effectively correct correct for this beam
  characteristic.
<p>
<li>Astigmatism - A weak cylindrical lens in the beam path will fully correct
  for the astigmatism of the laser diode or this function can be combined into
  a single collimating or focusing lens.  For a custom setup, the latter
  approach could be much more expensive since the lens would need to be ground
  to an astigmatic figure to match the divergence and astigmatism of the laser
  diode.  However, the mass-produced molded plastic lenses in CD players and
  similar devices can be of this type since the costly grinding only needs to
  be done once (to make the mold) and this then saves an element in the final
  optical system.
<p>
  An alternative technique, apparently used in many optical pickups, is to pass
  the beam through a thick optical plate having parallel sides at an angle
  (actually combined with the 45 degree beamsplitter mirror when used for this
  application).  This component has a very significant astigmatic effect whose
  magnitude is easily controlled by selecting the thickness or adjusting the
  angle of the plate.  In the optical pickup, it is used to add astigmatism for
  the focusing servo but can just as easily be used to eliminate it.  See the
  document: <A HREF=""http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/cdfaq.htm">Notes on
  the Troubleshooting and Repair of Compact Disc Players and CDROM Drives</A>
  for more information on optical pickup characteristics.
</ul>
<p>
Still another approach which will correct for the elliptical beam profile and
astigmatism all at once is to couple the beam into a single mode optical fiber
using two short focal length lenses.  With a sufficiently long fiber (well,
relative to the wavelength), the output beam characteristics will be entirely
determined by the quality of the output face of the fiber.  Then, a simple
collimating lens can be used.
<p>
Whatever type of external optics are added, take care that significant power
isn't reflected back into the laser diode itself.  This can destabilize the
lasing process as well as fooling the built-in photodiode into thinking the
output power is higher than it really is causing the optical feedback circuit
to reduce it.
<p>
Some additional comments are provided below:
<p>
(Portions from: Mark W. Lund (lundm@physc1.byu.edu).)
<p>
A simple short focal length lens will collimate the beam.  However, laser
diodes tend to be astigmatic which means that you will have one axis
collimated at a different focus than the other.  A typical value for this
astigmatism is 40 microns.  A cylindrical lens in addition to the spherical
collimating lens or a special lens designed for this purpose can correct this
but may not be needed for non-critical applications.
<p>
Any camera lens will be able to produce a reasonably well collimated beam
(subject to the astigmatism mentioned above).  Put the laser diode at the
focal point of the lens.  If you want the type of narrow beam produced by a
HeNe laser, you need a short focal length lens, such as a microscope
objective.  A good compromise between cheap and short focal length would be
an old disk camera lens.  These cameras can be found at thrift shops, garage
or yard sales, and flea markets for a couple dollars or less.
<p>
The longer the focal length the larger your beam will be, but the less effect
the astigmatism will have.  The diameter of the beam will be the size of the
aperture of the lens (in which case you are throwing away light) or the size
of the beam at the distance of one focal length, whichever is less.
<p>
(From: Steve Nosko (q10706@email.mot.com).)  
<p>
One thing to note is that the laser diode actually has two apparent point
sources.  One for the wide axis of the beam and another for the narrow axis. 
This means that the lens must be more like two crossed cylindrical lenses with
different focal lengths.  There are different types of laser diodes with
varying degrees of this so that some are easier to to design lenses for.
There probably are types, by now, where there aren't two.
<p>
I think of it like this (right or wrong). The astigmatism has two components.
One is the difference in divergence between the two axes.  I think this can be
even if there is ONLY one apparent point source.  It is just a point source
with an oval aperture letting light through.  The other is the different
apparent point sources for the two axes.

<h3><A NAME="dioldbb">Laser Diodes with Built-In Beam Correction</A></h3>

Laser diodes are also available with the corrections built in.  Check out
the Circulaser(tm) from <A HREF="http://www.blueskyresearch.com/">Blue Sky
Research</A>.  These look like any other 3 pin bare laser diode in a standard
5.6 or 9 mm package but produce a nearly circular diffraction limited beam
requiring no additional beam aberration correction for many applications.
Their divergence is also much less than that of a typical normal laser diode
(8 degrees typical) easing the requirements of additional collimating or fiber
coupling optics and capturing more of the available optical output power.
Complete specifications and a photo of a typical device can be found at their
Web site.
<p>
I have tested a
Blueskyresearch PS106 (now discontinued but similar to the VPSL-0655-007)
which is a 650 nm, 7 mW Circulaser(tm).  The beam is indeed nearly perfectly
circular with a divergence of about 8 degrees FWHM - less than that of the
lower divergence (slow) axis of the typical bare laser diode.
For datasheets, go to
<A HREF="http://www.Blueskyresearch.com/">Blueskyresearch</A>, then
"Semiconductor Laser Products".
<p>
Aside from the convenience of not having to worry about their funny beam
shape, putting a microlens next to the laser diode itself results in much
more of the light being used compared with what gets through inexpensive
external optics.  With the typical collimating lens used in laser pointers
and diode laser modules, as much as 40% <i>or more</i> of the light from the
diode may be wasted largely due to its high divergence in the fast axis (30
or 40 degrees total at the half power point, perhaps twice this at the 10%
point) - a very significant fraction gets blocked by the small aperture of
the collimating lens.

<h3><A NAME="dioldbd">Laser Diodes with Built-In Drivers</A></h3>

Some manufacturers are now (end of 2006) offering laser diodes in normal
laser diode packages (9 mm, 5.6 mm, and even a tiny 3.3 mm) with an integral
APC (Automatic Power Control) driver.  Thus, all one needs to do is supply
power to produce a constant output power beam.  These also avoid many of
the handling issues of normal laser diodes since the silicon-based driver
chip isolates and protects the laser diode itself from ESD and overcurrent.
Depending on version, these may be connected directly to a DC power supply
or battery for a fixed output power, or with a capacitor and resistor for
variable output power.
<p>
One supplier is <A HREF="http://www.laser66.com/">Creative Technology
Lasers</A>.  They even have a super miniature collimated diode laser module
only 4 mm (less than 1/6th of an inch) in diameter which connects directly
to a 3.3 VDC power source.  Check out their "LS" series of diode laser modules.
<p>
Given the many advantages of this approach, I wouldn't be surprised if
it becomes most common for visible laser diodes used for applications like
laser pointers and barcode scanners.

<h3><A NAME="diobcmm">Beam Correction for Multimode Laser Diodes</A></h3>

These are generally higher power from 100 mW to many watts.  They produce
a diffraction limited beam in the fast axis direction (perpendicular to
the output facet) but a multimode top hat profile in the slow axis
direction (along the facet or stripe).  Thus diffraction limited correction
is possible for the fast axis but the slow axis is limited to what can be
done with geometric optics.
<p>
So for the fast axis, two lenses will produce a diffraction limited collimated
beam.  A very short focal length cylindrical lens is placed almost touching
the diode to reduce the typical 40 degree divergence of the raw diode to
a few degrees.  This is usually a very thin rod lens or piece of fiber core.
A second conventional lens is then used to control the beam diameter and
collimation.  Note that to only affect the fast axis, this would also
be a cylindrical lens.
<p>
For the slow axis, an anamorphic prism pair may be used to expand the beam
followed by a lens to collimate it.  With care in the design, that second
lens can be the same spherical positive lens for both axes.  But you can
also do it with separate cylindrical lenses.  A pair of cylindrical lenses
can be used in place of the anamorphic prisms
<p>
There are many other ways of doing this.  For example, the output of the
can have just the initial fast axis correction using a fiber lens and
then be coupled directly into a multimode fiber.  The output of the fiber
core is then used as the source for a projection lens.  But there may be
annoying variations in granularity or speckle with any bending of the
fiber, temperature changes, vibration, etc.

<h3><A NAME="diobcc4">Coherence Length of Laser Diodes</A></h3>

The party line has generally been that internal cavity Fabry-Perot (a fancy
name for the usual side-emitting type) laser diodes have coherence lengths on
the order of millimeters.  Such claims are based at least partially on a
comparison with other much larger lasers where the coherence length is usually
on the order of the physical length of the cavity.  Laser diode chips are a
fraction of a mm on a side.  Thus, very short coherence lengths were expected.
<p>
However, this general rule appears not to apply for all laser diodes including
those in many common diode laser modules and even cheap ($9.95) laser pointers.
These are now being used routinely for experiments in interferometry and even
holography.  While their stability over time (e.g., wavelength drift and
susceptibility to mode hopping) - is probably less than stellar, over the
short term, coherence lengths of 20 cm or more are not unusual.  This is
similar to that of a typical helium-neon laser.
<p>
For more on applications that may benefit from long coherence length diode
lasers, see the sections: <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liaint4">Interferometers Using
Inexpensive Laser Diodes</A><A HREF="laserlia.htm#liaint5">Can I Use the
Pickup from a CD Player or CDROM Drive for Interferometry?</A>.  Also see the
section: <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liahol4">Holography Using Cheap Diode
Lasers</A>.
<p>
(From: Mark W. Lund (mlund@powerstream.com).)
<p>
The 1970's grade pulsed laser diodes have coherence lengths of 500 microns or so.
Modern CW single mode diodes have coherence lengths of meters.  I once asked Don
Scifries why they had such long coherence lengths compared to gas lasers with much
larger cavities and he referred me some papers.  The impression that remains after
13 years is not that laser diodes are so good, but that HeNe Lasers are so bad.
Line width of a typical 780 nm CD laser can be 10s of kHz.
<p>
(From: Prof Harvey Rutt (h.rutt@ecs.soton.ac.uk).)
<p>
**Crudely**, a CW laser will go SLM (Single Longitudinal Mode) spontaneously if
the mode separation exceeds the *inhomogeneous* linewidth.  The homogeneous
linewidth can exceed the mode separation because inter mode competition suppresses
the other modes CW.  But if mode than mode falls within an inhomogeneous width, and
is above threshold, all may oscillate as they do not compete.
<p>
The coherence length of a HeNe laser is a simple matter: inhomogeneous linewidth
set by Doppler broadening, mode separation set by length, usually a few modes run
(or it would power cycle badly) so coherence length is approximately the cavity
length divided by number of modes.  When it goes single mode (but, unless
stabilized, very unstable power output) the coherence length is typically huge.
*AND* the absolute frequency is then pretty stable, within half a mode spacing
of the atomic line.  Simple HeNes are so 'bad' to get reasonable power stability
as the cavity length drifts; less than 3 modes->poor.
<p>
Most diodes have a pretty broad spontaneous linewidth and how much it is
homogeneous or inhomogeneous I'm not clear; possibly as manufacturing has
improved the inhomogeneous component has tended to reduce to below the mode
spacing?  Cavity length is way sub-mm, so as soon as it does twin mode the
coherence length is awful.
<p>
I have *directly* measured the output spectrum of many near IR diodes, and all
bar one set were severely multimode. One set (normal FP lasers) were all single,
which surprised me. I think I've only looked at one visible (a while back) and it
was heavily multi mode.
<p>
When a simple diode does go SLM, surely one might expect it still to have pretty
severe wavelength drift with chip temperature? This can certainly wreck holography.
<p>
Obviously people have found pragmatically you can get away without an expensive DFB
laser; that crude diodes can be SLM; it opens up the interesting qn of just why it
seems modern diodes are tending to go SLM spontaneously, & how stable the output
wavelength is when they do go SLM (order nm/degree from memory?)
<p>
(From: Bret Cannon (bdcannon@owt.com).)
<p>
There are two temperature tuning rates for a diode laser, one is the tuning
of a given longitudinal mode with temperature and the other is the tuning
over larger temperature changes where the lasing mode hope from longitudinal
mode to longitudinal mode to be close to the peak of the gain curve.  The
average tuning rate for this later rate is typically 0.3 nm/&deg;C while for
small enough temperature changes the tuning of longitudinal mode is much
smaller.  For a temperature stability of 1 mK a diode laser frequency is
stable to better than 0.001 cm-1, perhaps even a good as 0.0001 cm-1 as
determined by tuning onto a Doppler-free atomic transition.  Thus at 780 nm
the temperature tuning of a longitudinal mode is less than 0.06 nm/&deg;C.  With
a temperature tuning of less than 1 cm-1/C, a temperature stability of 0.1 &deg;C
during an exposure would give a coherence length longer than 10 cm.
<p>
Unless there is external optical feedback or a very sophisticated electronic
feedback there is no way that a 780 nm CD laser would have a linewidth of
10s of kHz.  With a sufficiently low noise current supply (less than 1
microamp RMS in a 1 MHz bandwidth) and temperature stabilization to about 1
mK, the intrinsic linewidth of diode lasers can be measured and they are
proportional to the inverse of the output power.  Linewidths of about 50 MHz
for a 3 mW laser and 5 MHz for a 30 mW laser are typical.  These linewidths
are 5 to 50 times the Shawlow-Townes linewidth for these lasers and results
from the coupling of the refractive index and the population inversion.
Moradian (sp?) who was at MIT at the time published experimental
measurements in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Henry published an analysis
of this line broadening mechanism but I don't remember exactly when.
<p>
The linewidth decreases with the square of the cavity length and with
external cavities a few cm long people have achieved linewidths of less than
1 kHz.  An example of this is work by Leo Holberg and colleagues at NIST in
Boulder for an optical clock based on an inter-combination line in optically
cooled and trapped atomic calcium.

<h3><A NAME="diobcc5">Coherence Time of Laser Diodes</A></h3>

(From: Bret Cannon (bret.cannon@pnl.gov).)
<p>
It depends on the laser diode, the power supply that is used, and the external
optical feedback into the diode laser.  With a single longitudinal mode diode,
without external optical feedback, and a current noise of less than 1 uA RMS
in a 1 MHz bandwidth, you can get linewidths of 10 MHz for a coherence time of
nanoseconds.  With optical feedback the linewidth can collapse to a few Hz or
explode to several terahertz, depending on its intensity and the delay time
between the light leaving the diode and returning to it.

<h3><A NAME="diobcc6">Temperature Dependence of Laser Diodes</A></h3>

In addition to impact on expected lifetime (power degradation and MTBF)
(See the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioldl0">Laser Diode Life</A>),
temperature effects the wavelength of an unstabilized (internal cavity) laser
diode due to changes in physical dimensions:
<p>
The wavelength shift for 808 nm diodes is generally around 2.5 nm (+/- 0.2 or
0.3 nm) per 10 &deg;C (or just say 0.3 nm/&deg;C)(, with the wavelength shift
to the red (longer) with increasing temperature.
<p>
For the violet/blue Nichia laser diodes, it's typically 0.04 nm per &deg;C.
<p>
Note that diode current also affect wavelength, partially due to temperature.
So, as a diode ages and requires more current for the same output, its
wavelength will also change.
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
It really depends on the laser (i.e., manufacturer) and temperature range you
are talking about.  A good rule of thumb is 0.3 nm per &deg;C over the
operating temperature range of the device  (About 30 GHz per &deg;C). That's
the average slope of  the curve though - it includes mode hops.  If you're
operating at a mode hop, you can get a lot more change than 30 GHz with a 1
&deg;C temperature change.  If you are between mode hops, it can be much less.
<p>
Mode hops can be a moving target too.  Optical feedback can cause them (even
minute amounts).  Or, you can operate at a specific temperature where there
are no mode hops today, but next week it might mode hop at that temperature.
<p>
Note that you can only go so far if you want to use temperature to reduce
the wavelength.  Even if you got the electronics to work under frigid
conditions, there is a minimum laser wavelength you can get from a particular
diode laser chip.  I'm not a physicist, but it has to do with the bandgap of
the materials used.  What you would get, as you cooled the thing, is lower and
lower threshold current, lower operating current, and longer lifetime.
<p>
(From: Richard Alexander (pooua@aol.com).)
<p>
Back in the old days, about 15 years ago, the only way to get visible light
from a laser diode was by using cryogenic cooling. My textbooks from my laser
degree program only knows of this type of visible laser diode (they were
written in the early '80s). The first room temperature visible laser diode was
invented about 1991; I still have a "Radio-Electronics" issue mentioning it.
<p>
(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
All laser diodes have a tolerance when it comes to wavelength, these
tolerances can be as high as +/- 10 nm.
<p>
The wavelength tolerances are due to thermal effects, and current. As the
diode heats up, the wavelength will change 0.3 nm/&deg;C. and results in
mode-hopping.

<h3><A NAME="dionois">Comments on Laser Diode Noise and Suppression</A></h3>

(From: F. Pelletier (f.pelletier@laposte.net).)
<p>
There are several types of noise in laser diodes: mode hopping as a 
temperature effect; intensity noise related to spontaneous emission; 
optical feedback due to reflection in the optics; speckle noise. What
you try to control is mode hopping and optical feedback noises.
<p>
As temperature varies, shift between modes is an issue but is intrinsic
to the LD. By using cooling elements, temperature is roughly regulated.
<p>
Optical feedback is part of the light emitted which returns to the laser
cavity after reflection on the mirrors but mainly after reflection on
the disk surface. The optical feedback varies from one system to
another, and from one disk to another, and even according to the area of
the disk. A maximum is about 5 to 8%.
<p>
Anyway, it has about the same effect as temperature, with mode hopping
that appears. The hops are kind of random with the optical feedback.
Globally, the RIN increases. The phenomenon is the most apparent with
monomode lasers. Measures show that multimode lasers have a much more
constant RIN with optical feedback. Adding a HF modulation makes the LD
to be driven multimode. That's why DVD manufacturers use a modulator.
They usually use single mode lasers as they have better characteristics
(lower noise, lower lasing threshold).
<p>
What I still don't entirely get is how the modulation works and its
effects. The system works fairly well only if the amplitude and the
frequency are high enough. The signal amplitude is such as you are
alternately in the linear curve and below the threshold (where the laser
is always multimode), and the frequency is well above the speed of
transmission (somewhere between 300 - 800 MHz, according to the
application and the LD).

<h2>Диодные лазерные модули и лазерные указки</h2>
<h3><A NAME="diodlm0">Альтернативы использованию голых лазерных диодов</A></h3>

Если то, что вы действительно хотите получить - это видимый лазер, готовые
модули на лазерных диодах или некоторые марки лазерных указок могут быть лучшим
решением. Те и другие содержат управляющую схему, способную нормально работать
от нестабилизированного низковольтного источника постоянного напряжения, и
коллимирующую линзу, подходящую к лазерному диоду. Многие новые модули позволяют
точно регулировать настройку положения линзы, чтобы улучшить коллимацию или
сфокусировать точку на определенном расстоянии. Существуют также генераторы
линий, или же точечный модуль можно превратить в генератор линии с помощью
цилиндрической линзы.
<p>
Однако ни одно из этих устройств не предназначено для модуляции с частотой больше
пары герц (если хотя бы с такой) из-за сильной внутренней фильтрации, чтобы защитить
лазерный диод от выбросов тока ("иголок"). Таким образом они как правило не подходят
для применения в лазерной связи (хотя некоторые лазерные указки так дешевы, что могут
совсем не содержать подобной защиты). Смотрите раздел
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioclpm">"The Benefits of Cheap Laser Pointers for
Modulation"</A>.
<p>
Распространенные видимые диодные лазеры имеют максимальную выходную мощность
от 3 до 5 мВт. Из-за спектральной зависимости чувствительности человеческого глаза 
длина волны 635 нм кажется как минимум в 4 раза ярче, чем равная мощность на 670 нм.
Поэтому там, где важна наилучшая видимость, предпочтительнее использовать лазерные
диоды с более короткой длиной волны.
<p>
Если для ваших целей подходит диодный лазерный модуль или лазерная указка, я
очень рекомендую предпочесть их попытке сборки чего-либо из голого лазерного
диода и самодельного блока питания - или даже заводского драйвера, если он
не предназначен специально для вашего диода. Действительно очень легко сжечь
дорогой лазерный диод неправильным питанием или обращением. Будучи сожжен,
лазерный диод не работает хорошо даже в качестве светодиода!
<p>
В главе <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">"Laser Parts Sources"</A> имеется список
поставщиков лазерных диодных модулей и лазерных указок. В дополнение к этому,
Don's Klipstein (don@misty.com) содержит веб-страницу со списком поставщиков
недорогих лазеров - <A HREF="http://www.misty.com/~don/lasersrc.html">"List of Suppliers of
Inexpensive Lasers"</A>.  Хоть и не являясь исчерпывающим, он содержит большую
часть популярных дистрибьютеров, а автор старается поддерживать список достаточно
свежим. Некоторые из этих компаний продают теперь лазерные указки дешевле $6!
Скоро мы будем находить бесплатные лазерные указки в коробках с пирожками. :)
<p>
Однако нет способа определить до покупки, насколько качественной или надежной будет та или иная
лазерная указка, или будет ли ее луч достаточно хорошего качества. Диодные лазерные
модули обычно дороже, но качественнее (хотя и не всегда), поэтому в серьезных применениях
лучше делать ставку на них. Любой Иванов, Петров или Сидоров может изготовить лазерную
указку из готовых деталей и продать в Интернете, но только серьезные компании делают
гелий-неоновые лазерные трубки, и их качество весьма высоко. У гелий-неонового лазера
трубка определяет большую часть характеристик луча, и требуется как максимум простая
линза, чтобы сколлимировать или сфокусировать луч. Дополнительную информацию
смотрите в главе <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoc">"Helium-Neon Lasers"</A>.
<p>
Наилучший источник недорогих лазерных диодов средней мощности (более 5 мВт и до
приблизительно 150 мВт) видимого красного (~650 нм) диапазона - это DVD-резаки.
Некоторые высококачественные устройства имеют лазер мощностью 100 мВт <i>и более</i>,
и они стоят как грязь - гораздо дешевле, чем отдельно лазерные диоды с завода.
На практике неисправные DVD-резаки могут содержать прекрасные лазерные диоды, поскольку
управляющие схемы для них обычно очень тщательно разработаны, а диоды имеют
высокое качество. Но если папин DVD-RW внезапно перестал работать, как только вы
почти сделали лазерный проектор, я этого вам не говорил. :)
<p>
(Прислал: Dr. Bob (stanwax@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Я недавно уничтожил пару приводов Liteon X16 DL DVD-RW. Я купил их новыми
(в заводской упаковке) по $32 только для того, чтобы выдрать из них лазерные
диоды (теперь они еще дороже). К сожалению, я не знаю ни изготовителя, ни
характеристик лазеров, но я питал один из них током 200 мА, и измеритель мощности,
настроенный на 658 нм, показал 150 мВт. Теперь это выгодное дело - хоть и весьма
расточительно, но это хорошая цена за 150-милливаттный диод. Я скомбинировал один
из них в проектор вместе с зеленым DPSS-лазером и модифицировал схему управления
диодом, чтобы обеспечить аналоговое гашение. Результаты весьма хороши. Я пригасил
луч зеленого лазера (он выдает обычно от 90 до 100 мВт), так что красный не
забивается, если красный лазер работает на 120 мВт.

<h3><A NAME="diolphi">Краткая история лазерной указки</A></h3>

Давным-давно, когда не было CD-плееров, когда не был изобретен лазер, люди использовали
палку, чтобы показать что-то на экране или черной доске (это было даже до изобретения
маркерных досок!). Самые ранние оптические указки использовали маленькие лампы накаливания,
линзу и маску или слайд, чтобы проецировать точку или стрелку. Такие устройства
были почти такого же размера, как большой (с батарейками D) фонарик, требовали
отдельного источника питания с проводом и обычно включались в розетку. Качество
было невысоким, поскольку луч нельзя было хорошо сколлимировать, но это был тем не
менее большой шаг вперед по сравнению с палкой. :) Однако, поскольку использовалась
лампа накаливания, можно было получить любой цвет с использованием светофильтров,
но из соображений наибольшей яркости обычно все же использовали белый.
<p>
Первые указки на основе лазеров были построены на гелий-неоновых лазерах с упакованными
как можно компактнее высоковольтными источниками питания, но все еще требовали
отдельный источник питания или большой ящик с тяжелыми батарейками. Поскольку это
были настоящие лазеры, луч был очень чистым и хорошо сколлимированным. Выпускались
как красные, так и зеленые гелий-неоновые указки (да, гелий-неоновые лазеры бывают
зелеными).
<p>
Но настоящая революция лазерных указок была результатом разработки недорогих видимых
лазерных диодов. Лазерные диоды лишь ненамного больше песчинки, питаются небольшим
напряжением и небольшим током и могут серийно выпускаться - будучи изначально созданными
революцией CD плееров/CDROM, сканерами штрих-кодов и другими применениями, где требовался
компактный недорогой источник лазерного излучения. Выпускаемые теперь миллионами,
эти лазерные диоды стоят гораздо меньше 1 доллара.

<h3><A NAME="diolps">Laser Pointer Specifications</A></h3>

Here are some of the things that manufacturers use to rate and promote
both red and green laser pointers:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wavelength:</b> This may be specified but don't trust it too much.
 Usually, lower is better since visibility is a strong function of wavelength.
 However, the variability can be significant - a pointer spec'd at 640 nm
 could indeed be closer to 650 nm and there's almost a 2:1 ratio of relative
 brightness between these extremes.
<p>
<li><b>Output power:</b> Power ratings are often made deliberately confusing
 like "&lt;5 mW", which could mean almost anything!  Even among identical
 models, there can be significant variation, especially for green DPSS laser
 pointers.
<p>
<li><b>Visibility:</b> Manufacturers will often compare visibility to the
 oldest 670 nm (or longer) wavelength.  All but the cheapest pointers today
 will be somewhere in the 640 to 650 nm range.  Between the shortest available
 wavelength of 635 nm and 670 nm is a ratio of relative brightness of about
 7:1.  Or, they'll compare a 1 mW 670 nm pointer to a 5 mW 640 nm unit and
 claim "35 times brighter".  Or for a green 5 mW pointer, "135 times
 brighter". :)  See the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodlm1">Equivalent
 Brightness Ratings and Laser Pointer Visibility</A>.
<p>
<li><b>Distance/range:</b> By itself, this is basically a totally useless
 number.  Do they mean on a moonless night under smog-free conditions?  Light
 doesn't travel a specific distance and stop, or suddenly become too dim to
 be seen.  It's only possible value would be in comparing various models from
 the same manufacturer/supplier and even there, they probably just associate
 a particular value with the output power and/or wavelength. 
<p>
<li><b>Beam shape/quality:</b> Without significant effort, the output of a red
 diode laser pointer is not a nice round spot.  More expensive pointers may
 have the necessary optics to do a decent job of beam shaping but most do not.
 Sometimes, the beam shape will be shown in the catalog or Web site listing,
 probably to convince you to upgrade to the model with the rounder spot.
 Green DPSS laser pointers may claim a TEM00 beam and some come quite close
 to perfection, though there will often tend to be a certain amount of
 ghosting and extraneous little spots associated with it.  For pointing at
 normal viewing distances, unless the beam shape is absolutely terrible, it
 doesn't really matter much.
<p>
<li><b>CW or pulsed:</b> As far as I know, all red laser pointers produce a
 continuous (CW) beam.  However, due to the way green DPSS lasers work, there
 are significant advantages in terms of efficiency and thus battery to use a
 pulsed system and many do.  As a practical matter, it doesn't much matter
 to the user unless the pointer is moved rapidly in which case the pulsed beam
 will show up as discrete spots rather than a continuous line.  (Note that
 red pointers could also benefit from pulsing but it would require a higher
 power more expensive laser diode and more complex driver, and the improvement
 in battery life - which is already very adequate - would only be modest.)
<p>
<li><b>APC or ACC driver:</b> Most red pointers use Automatic Power Control
 (APC) to maintain the output power constant over temperature and until the
 batteries are nearly dead.  The laser diode package itself has a built-in
 photodiode behind the laser diode chip for this purpose.  Only the very
 cheap "dollar store" Far East import red pointers forgo this feature and
 simply use a current limiting resistor - as the batteries discharge, the
 output grows dimmer.
<p>
 Most green laser pointers have in the past used Automatic Current Control
 (ACC) - a constant current driver.  The result is generally fluctuations
 in output power as the pointer heats up.  These may be quite large and
 result in either a very dim spot or an excessive and illegal super bright
 beam.  The trend now is to use an APC driver to eliminate variability and
 also make it harder to "boost" the output to an illegal and dangerous
 power level.
<p>
<li><b>Plastic versus glass optics:</b> Plastic is softer than glass so if
 the surface of the collimating lens is exposed, it will be more easily
 damaged through carelessness and cleaning.  However, since most of the time,
 the lens is recessed, this isn't a major issue.  What really matters is the
 quality of the lens(es) and coatings, not what they are made of.  Glass is
 NOT inherently superior to platics.  This affects the spot size and
 definition, and the amount of ghosting and scatter.  The only way to
 know for sure is to check the beam for yourself.
<p>
<li><b>Adjustable focusing lens:</b> While this may at first appear to be
 highly desirable, in the end it may turn out to be a nuisance going out of
 focus on its own and prone to constant fiddling.  (Of course, a piece of
 adhesive tape or dab of glue can cure this malady.)  However, make sure
 that the pointer you acquire has had its focus properly set at the factory!
 Even an apparently fixed focus model may have an internal ring that can be
 turned with a paper clip once the front bezel is removed.  Just don't
 force anything and take care not to scratch the lens.
<p>
<li><b>Multiple pattern generating optics:</b> These are the sort of thing
 that appear really neat and cute but in my opinion, have at most, limited
 value.  They reduce the overall brightness of the projected spot and except
 for a basic arrow, just detract from a presentation.
<p>
<li><b>Battery:</b> The amount of time claimed for a set of batteries may tend
 to be optimistic.  Some/many/most may assume something about the usage pattern
 in a pointing application (as opposed to cat teasing) like "25 percent on, 75
 percent off".  Red pointers are generally much much better in the battery life
 department.  The brightness of some pointers decreases significantly as the
 batteries are drained which others remain exactly the same and then poop out
 without warning.  Expected cost of batteries will be affected by the battery
 type - watch style button cells, AAA or N type alkalines, or expensive
 lithium batteries.  Although not as compact, pointers using common AAA cells
 are probably the most economical in terms of battery replacement costs (and
 AAAs are certainly the most readily available).
<p>
 The shape and size of a pointer is determined largely by the type of battery
 used.  The tiniest red pointers use button cells like the one shown
 in <A HREF="slasptr.jpg">Components of Simplest Red Laser Pointer</A>.
 Long thin pointers (red or green) use a pair of AAA Alkaline cells like
 the one shown in <A HREF="grnptr1.jpg">Components of Typical Green DPSS
 Laser Pointer</A>.  The fat squat type shown in
 <A HREF="grnptr2.jpg">Components of Edmunds Scientific L54-101 Green DPSS
 Laser Pointer</A> uses a CR2 lithium cell.  Whether aesthetics determines
 the battery design choice or vice-versa is anyone's guess.
<p>
 In general, it is best to remove the batteries if the pointer won't be used
 for even a short time.  Batteries have been known to leak and/or swell,
 usually once they go dead.  This is probably most likely to happen with
 the cheap carbon-zinc cells provided as original equipment.  It's virtually
 impossible to salvage a pointer once such damage occurs because the cells
 essentially wedge themselves in place as they expand. :(
<p>
<li><b>Life expectancy and warranty:</b> Sometimes there will be a spec like
 "2,000 hour lifetime".  This is probably mostly relevant for the expensive
 green DPSS laser pointers and may be reasonable.  Certainly, anything over
 1,000 hours is adequate for a pointer used as a pointer within one's (human)
 lifetime (or until it becomes obsolete).  However, any lifetime claim isn't
 of much value unless there is an enforceable warranty!
<p>
<li><b>Fancy case:</b> The polished hardwood case that comes with most green
 pointers is really worse than useless.  Dropping the pointer in the case will
 likely render it useless.  A cheap padded foam case would provide much
 more protection.  Red pointers are more robust but could still benefit from
 pampering. :)
</ul>
<p>
By now, you're probably totally confused.  My advice: Use the specs for
guidance but if you really care about the quality of your laser pointer,
try a few out which come with money back no-questions-asked warranties and
keep the one you like.  If, on the other hand, you just want to use the
pointer for presentations (what a concept!) and not to stroke your ego, the
cheapest red one will probably be just fine. :)

<h3><A NAME="diodlm1">Equivalent Brightness Ratings and Laser Pointer
 Visibility</A></h3>

Some companies that sell laser pointers, rate them in terms of 'equivalent
brightness' compared to a 670 nm device.  The Mark-I eyeball is about 7
times more sensitive to light at 635 nm compared to 670 nm.  (Green laser
pointers at 532 nm will multiply this by another factor of 4 or 5.)  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioicav2">Relative Visibility of Light at Various
Wavelengths</A>.)  For example, several of these companies offer laser pointers
with a '30 mW equivalent' output.  This just means they are comparing a 635 nm
device optimistically to one of 670 nm.  The actual output power is still less
than 5 mW.  I do not really consider this deceptive marketing as long as the
meaning is understood.  Here is a handy quick comparison chart for common and
not so common laser pointer wavelengths:

<p>
The term "Relative" refers to the visibility compared to the 555 nm peak of
human vision; the "factor" compares the brightness to that of an older 670 nm
pointer.  Note that visual perception of brightness is not linear.  Thus,
a 1 mW 532 nm green laser pointer isn't actually going to appear 28 times
brighter than a 1 mW 670 nm red model.  What it means is that a 1 mW green
pointer will appear <i>similar</i> in brightness to a 28 mW 670 nm red one
(if such a thing existed).
<p>
As far as I know, CDRH approval will not be granted for any device of this
type over 5 mW actual beam power since their classification would then need to
be IIIb.  So, don't expect to find a laser diode with an actual output power
of 30 mW in anything like a laser pointer!  Frankly, I don't understand how
laser pointers with an output above 1 mW gain approval in any case.  The 670
nm pointers especially (since they APPEAR less bright) represent a definite
hazard to vision at close range.  Do not underestimate the stupidity of some
people who totally ignore all the safety warnings - "Wow, look at these cool
afterimages." - and then wonder why their vision never quite returns to
normal (though I do not know of any confirmed cases of irreversible damage
to vision even from this sort of abuse).
<p>
Another popular 'specification' is how far away the laser pointer is visible.
What the seller is probably actually referring to is the distance that their
Marketing department *thinks* the beam should be visible so long as this value
is greater than that of their competition. :-)
<p>
Seriously, who knows?  There is no standards organization overseeing these
ratings.  It could be the maximum distance to the screen that the beam is
visible:
<p>
<ol>
<li>to the person holding the pointer.
<li>to someone near the screen looking at the screen.
<li>to someone near the screen looking in the direction of the pointer.
</ol>
<p>
Another consideration, of course, is whether this requires a moonless night!
<p>
Laser pointer marketers don't appear to have discovered (3) as yet (most
likely due to liability issues) since the number would be extremely
impressive - being in the many miles range!  Apparently the Space Shuttle
astronauts were able to see a 5 mW red HeNe laser (632.8 nm, similar to the
best red laser pointers) from orbit, about 250 miles or 1.3 million feet.
Claims could be even more impressive for a green DPSS laser pointer (532 nm),
being about 5 times brighter for the same output power.  Any marketing types
reading this? :)

<h3><A NAME="diodlm2">What's Inside a Laser Pointer?</A></h3>

The description below applies to most red laser pointers sold today (pen or
key-chain type).  For info on green laser pointers, see the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodlm2a">Green (or Other Color) Laser Pointers</A>).
For a quick introduction to both types, see:
<A HREF="http://safeco2.home.att.net/laser.htm">The LED Museum's Bit on
Laser Pointers</A>.
<p>
A common red laser pointer contains the following components as shown in
<A HREF="lsrptr1.gif">Typical Red Laser Pointer</A>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Laser diode.  This will have a 3 to 5 mW maximum output.  The laser diodes
 in older/cheaper laser pointers produced light at 670 nm (deep red).
 Newer/better ones are in the 650 to 635 nm range (red to orange-red, which
 appears many times brighter, mW for mW than 670 nm).  Someday, we will see
 inexpensive diode laser based laser pointers at all colors of the spectrum -
 someday.  Early laser pointers had the laser diode in its own 5 or 9 mm can
 package mounted (probably press-fit) in a metal casting which in addition to
 holding the optics (see below) acts as a heat sink.  In an effort to reduce
 costs, the newest and cheapest ones have the bare laser diode chip mounted
 directly to a heatsink.  You can forget about attempting to replace one of
 these at home!  In addition, they are likely not hermetically sealed so
 contamination can easily enter from the battery compartment and degrade
 diode performance or kill it entirely.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diocss">Basic Characteristics,
 Structure, Safety, Common Types</A>
<p>
<li>Power source.  These are typical AAA Alkaline cells or watch-style button
 cells.  Depending on design, the battery must produce 1.5 V to 4.5 V or more.
 In general, it isn't a good idea to substitute one type of battery for another
 unless you know what effect it might have.  With some, a dead pointer is the
 most likely result.  The battery holder may be a part of the case or a
 separate unit.  The on/off switch may be a simple spring contact or a high
 quality enclosed type.
<p>
<li>Power regulator.  Many of the visible laser diodes used in laser pointers
 have very precise current requirements.  Too little and they don't lase; too
 much and they turn into poor imitations of LEDs or die entirely.  The only
 reliable way of regulating the current for these is by monitoring the light
 output.  So, nearly all (if not totally all) laser pointers used to include
 a laser diode driver that provides some degree of regulation based on optical
 feedback from the monitor photodiode inside the laser diode package.  The
 better designs would maintain output power nearly constant until the batteries
 were drained; the output power for some simpler designs would vary with
 battery condition.
<p>
 However, The Far East imports now flooding the market use only a resistor to
 limit current - driving the laser diode just like an LED.  The circuitry
 consists of only 4 parts: laser diode, resistor, switch, battery.  Apparently,
 the type of laser diode they use has a wider operating range and can be driven
 safely this way, though the output brightness will decrease as the batteries
 are drained.  See <A HREF="slasptr.jpg">Components of Simplest Red Laser
 Pointer</A> and <A HREF="slasptrc.jpg">Closeup of Laser and Mount from
 Simplest Laser Pointer</A>.  The inset in the first photo shows the laser
 diode chip itself attached to a tiny metal block which is soldered directly to
 the cast metal which acts as a heatsink.  The top contact is a 1 mil gold
 bonding wire.
<p>
 Without the schematic there is no way to know how much protection is provided
 by the driver.  With some, the diode which can easily be
 destroyed in an instant by using the wrong type of batteries, an external
 power source (even one that you would think should work), or even putting
 the batteries in backwards.  The best designs will use a circuit that
 regulates optical output based on feedback from the laser diode's built-in
 monitor photodiode with respect to a fixed reference (voltage) and
 maintain output power nearly constant under the battery is almost totally
 drained.
<p>
 On most pointers and diode laser modules, the laser diode driver is on a tiny
 printed circuit board soldered directly to the leads of the laser diode
 package.  However, on some, the driver may be right next to the diode, sealed
 in metal and look like part of the diode can, but isn't (possibly glued or
 press-fit).  This is likely the case if what appears to be the laser diode
 only has two leads - all the visible laser diodes I know of come in 3 (or
 possibly 4) lead packages to accommodate the monitor photodiode connections.
<p>
 See the sections: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsadl1">Power Regulators in Laser
 Pointers</A> and: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpslp1">Laser Diode Driver from Cheap
 Laser Pointer (LP-LD1)</A>.
<p>
<li>Collimating/correcting optics.  At the very least, there must be a lens
 to convert the highly divergent beam from the bare laser diode to one that is
 roughly parallel.  Better models will include optics to correct (at least
 partially) for the laser diode's inherent wedge shape and astigmatism.  Some
 will also have an easy focus adjustment.  In this case, a threaded barrel
 (usually made of brass) holding the lens can be screwed in and out.  A
 spring presses on the lens to prevent unintentional movement and minimize
 backlash.  This is then sealed with something like Locktite or Glyptal.  On
 cheaper pointers, the lens or barrel will just be Epoxied in place with no
 easy possibility of adjustment.  Even if not an advertised feature, there may
 be an internal ring that can be turned with a paper clip once the front bezel
 is removed.  Just don't force anything and take care not to scratch the lens.
<p>
 Note that with the typical optics used in laser pointers, as much as 40%
 <i>or more</i> of the light from the diode may be wasted largely due to its
 high divergence in the fast axis (30 or 40 degrees total at the half power
 point, perhaps twice this angle at the 10% point) - a very significant
 fraction gets blocked by the small aperture of the collimating lens.  I found
 that an NVG D660-5 laser diode with an NVG collimating lens resulted in just
 about a 50% loss between what was measured with the sensor of the laser power
 meter against the diode's face capturing every photon compared to what ended
 up in the collimated beam.  I've been running one of these 5 mW diodes
 continuously at a total output of 10 mW without any noticeable degradation.
 With the addition of a microlens next to the laser diode chip, it would be
 possible to capture a much higher percentage of the total light.  With the
 5 mW limit for laser pointers, this doesn't much matter but for other diode
 laser applications, this would be beneficial.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioldbb">Laser Diodes with Built-In Beam
 Correction</A>.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diobcc">Beam Characteristics,
 Correction, Comparison with Other Lasers, Noise</A>
<p>
<li>Some means of generating multiple patterns (optional).  These permit the
 projected shape to be selected to be something other than a formless spot
 either by a built-in thumb-wheel type thingie or by replacing end-caps.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diolppm">Laser Pointers that Produce
 Multiple Patterns</A>
</ul>

Photos of the internal components of typical red laser pointers can be found
in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under
"Assorted Diode Lasers".  The actual laser diode is not visible in any of
these being inside the brass cylinder next to the driver circuit board.

<h3><A NAME="diolppm">Laser Pointers that Produce Multiple Patterns</A></h3>

You've seen the Ads: "Laser Pointer with 42 Heads, $9.95.".  These patterns may
be in the form of arrows or stars or a company's logo.  They are either
built-in and selected by a thumb-wheel type arrangement or are in the form of
interchangeable tips that slip over the end of the pointer (as in the 'Ad'
above).  There are 2 basic ways of accomplishing this:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Templates (stamped or photographically generated) in the form of the
 pattern - basically a micro-sized slide.  Since the beam from a laser pointer
 is relatively well collimated or slightly diverging effectively originating
 from a point source, anything placed in its path will be projected without
 serious defocusing or degradation - over a modest distance at least.  Thus,
 the condensing and projection lenses of a slide projector are not needed.
 This is the obvious and low tech approach but has at least two disadvantages:
 Much of the available light is blocked by the solid parts of the template and
 the edges of the pattern result in diffraction and interference effects which
 DO degrade the projected image eventually.  However, almost any graphic can
 be produced equally well (or poorly depending on your perspective).
<p>
 This type can be easily recognized because there will be a teeny-tiny replica
 of its pattern visible by looking closely at the beam aperture.
<p>
 Also see the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioidpg6">Pattern Generation Using
 Conventional Optics</A>.
<p>
<li>Diffractive optics (also called a Holographic Optical Element or HOE).
 A holographic process is used to produce a plate or film which when placed in
 the laser pointer's beam, generates a pattern through interference just as
 with a true hologram.  These are more expensive to produce than simple stamped
 patterns (at least in small quantities) and there may be some restrictions as
 to the types of patterns (non-symmetric) that can be easily produced.
<p>
 HOEs can be recognized by looking at them in normal lighting.  What you will
 see is: Absolutely Nothing.  Or, at most, a dirty smudge, but no resemblance
 to what results when used with the laser pointer.
<p>
 For more info and suppliers, see the sections starting with:
 <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioidpg4">Diffractive Pattern Generating Optics</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Constructing your own pattern generating heads is probably not a realistic
option except perhaps for simple patterns using the template approach and even
that would be quite a challenge given the small diameter of the beam as it
leaves the pointer.  Considering how cheap these things are now, it is also
probably not worth the effort unless it's something very special.
<p>
In my opinion, except possibly for an arrow, these things are really of little
practical value.

<h3><A NAME="diooclp">Orange, Yellow, and Green Light from Red Laser
 Pointer?</A></h3>

While the lasing line from a diode laser or even a cheap laser pointer is
quite narrow, there can be other wavelengths of incoherent light present in
the beam.  Since the effective aperture of the laser diode is nearly a point
source (1x3 um typical), these spurious outputs will still collimate and/or
focus nearly as well as the laser beam itself.  However, it's highly unlikely
that any of these are actual lasing lines except very near the main (design)
wavelength.  No, you can't convert a red laser pointer into a rainbow pointer
with a simple modification performed on your kitchen table! :)
<p>
I've seen the existence of faint non-lasing light from more than one cheap
laser pointer as well as from a "dead" red laser pointer where the laser
diode had turned into an expensive LED.  The orange, yellow, and green
output was of similar intensity to the same spurious colors present in the
lasing laser pointers so it is likely not related to high field intensities
when lasing but due to impurities resulting in non-red LED light.
<p>
To test for this (assuming you don't have an optical spectrum analyzer
handy), if the pointer doesn't have an adjustable focusing lens, use a weak
positive lens to focus the beam at a distance from the pointer of 0.5 to 1
meter - where the spot is still quite small, say less than 1 mm.  Then, use
a diffraction grating (almost any will do including a CD or DVD) to view one
of these focused first order spots on a white card.  Set things up so the spot
is either blocked or misses the card entirely so all you see is the area
towards the 0th order spot (undeflected beam).  For my sample, there was a
continuous tail amounting to a few dozen nm.  I couldn't quite tell if it
hit green but definitely was well into the yellow.
<p>
Another approach is to pass the beam of the pointer through a series of
mirrors that only transmit non-red wavelengths or reflect it from a series
of mirrors that only reflect non-red wavelengths.  Using a pair of HeNe laser
resonator mirrors (an HR and OC in series) reduced the intensity of the red
wavelengths by a factor of about 100,000 so only a hand full of red photons
got through. :)  This allowed me to clearly see the orange, yellow, and green
output of the laser pointer mentioned above by looking into the beam through a
diffraction grating.  (Yes, this is safe once the red is filtered by the
two mirrors.  It's just a dim glow and barely visible when projected
on a white screen in pitch blackness.)  WARNING: Don't try the equivalent
experiment (looking into the filtered beam) with a DPSS (green or blue) laser
as there could be a significant amount of mostly invisible pump light at
around 808 nm that gets through to fry your eyeballs.
<p>
If you can power the pointer from an adjustable DC power supply (or have some
weak batteries), there may be an even easier way to see the non-lasing
colors - power the diode just below the lasing threshold.  Under these
conditions, output at the lasing wavelength won't drown out the broad-band
LED emission and it will be easy to see its spectrum using any diffraction
grating or prism (or even through the edge of lens in a strong pair of
glasses!).
<p>
The use of the human eye apparently works a lot better than a fancy Optical
Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) because the intensity of the level for the non-lasing
wavelengths is so low and spread over a substantial range.  The only thing
visible using an Ando OSA set to maximum sensitivity and averaging 10 times
was a slow increase in amplitude starting at about 566 nm and continuing to
the lasing wavelength of about 635 nm, but this wasn't even conclusively
above the noise floor for the instrument.
<p>
(From: Steve J. Quest (squest@att.net).)
<p>
The keyword here is you have a CHEAP laser pointer.  I'm going to presume the
injection crystal lattice has contaminants in it, more likely if the
manufacturer also builds LEDs in the same factory.  What you are getting
from your laser is a RED laser beam, and possibly green, orange, and yellow
LED light (non-coherent) which is also coming from the same crystal.  Fire it
through a prism to see the various lines, I bet it's so polluted with foreign
dopants, that it produces a bright red coherent line, and a few non-coherent
red lines, an orange line, a yellow line, and a green line.  That's all
possible since the injection diode crystal is basically an LED crystal with
perfectly cleaved ends, and a channeled electron injection pathway, axial to
the beam.
<p>
You can typically see this effect if you test the cheapest LEDs you can find
with a prism.  I've found that dirt cheap green LEDs usually produce both a
green and a yellow line.  Dirt cheap reds produce several lines of red.
You can get many wavelengths out of a gallium arsenide crystal.

<h3><A NAME="diodlm2a">Green (or Other Color) Laser Pointers</A></h3>

Red laser pointers are by far the most common and now quite inexpensive.
Pretty soon, they will be given away free in specially marked boxes of corn
flakes. :)  Seriously, prices under $5 aren't uncommon and dropping rapidly.
Search on eBay and you'll probably find them for less than $1 each in bulk.
However, except for various shades of red (depending on wavelength), all
other colors are very expensive.  In fact, there is really only one other
color of any practical consequence - green.  And this is a much different
type of laser than the simple diode lasers used in red laser pointers.
<p>
Currently, nearly all green laser pointers are based on Diode Pumped Solid
State Frequency Doubled (DPSSFD) laser technology.  They are not just red
laser pointers with a different laser diode or green lens!  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers</A>.)
<p>
The exceptions are older models using green helium-neon (HeNe) lasers.  I bet
you didn't know HeNe lasers came in green, huh? :)  These had power outputs of
much less than 1 mW and were very bulky compared to modern laser pointers.  And
while green HeNe lasers and even relatively small green HeNe lasers that
could be used for laser pointers - are still manufactured, actually
using them for pointing is about as common as finding raw dinosaur eggs.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht1">HeNe Tubes of a Different
Color</A> if you are curious.)
<p>
The wavelength of the DPSSFD lasers is 532 nm based on the intracavity
frequency doubling of a Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate) chip using a Potassium
Titanyl Phosphate, KTiOPO<sub>4</sub> (KTP) crystal inside the laser cavity.
Their output may either be CW, quasi-CW, or pulsed.  CW means "continuous
wave" which results in a constant intensity spot.  Quasi-CW and pulsed both
result in a spot that varies in intensity (so they are really both pulsed
output) but the pulses for the quasi-CW variety may be at a much higher
frequency (e.g., 5 kHz versus 300 Hz).  You can tell which you have by moving
the spot rapidly across a screen - the trace from the quasi-CW and pulsed
types will break into discrete spots.  However, the spot spacing for the
quasi-CW pointers may be so small for normal use that for all intents and
purposes, they will appear continuous.  However, a quasi-CW pointer would
not be a good choice to use in a laser show application.  (Note that there
is no standard for calling a particular pointer quasi-CW or pulsed so your
advertising blurb mileage may vary!)
<p>
Visibility of these green pointers is 4 to 5 times that of 635 nm diode lasers
or 632.8 nm red HeNe lasers, which in turn appear 6 or 7 times brighter than
the older 670 nm laser diode based laser pointers for the same power output.
The maximum legal green laser pointer power is still only 5 mW but this would
be equivalent in brightness to something like a 150 mW, 670 nm device!  And,
the sellers of these things don't let you forget it! :)
<p>
Battery life of any green pointer is likely to be much worse than that of
the simpler red variety though for actual uses as a *pointer* (what a
concept!), it probably doesn't matter all that much.  The quasi-CW and pulsed
variety should be somewhat better in this regard.  (The "spec" sheet that
comes with the Edmund Scientific L54-101 green laser pointer claims a 3 to 4
hour battery life from a CR2 lithium cell though I'm not sure I believe it.)
There is no functional advantage to the pulsed system (it's actually less
desirable since the spot breaks up into dots when swept over a screen) but it
can be made much more efficient reducing the need for thermal management and
extending battery life at the same perceived brightness for these current
hogs.  Quasi-CW (frequency in the kHz range) pointers may use either a pulsed
pump diode, a passive Q-switch (sometimes called FRQS - Free Running
Q-Switch), or both, to improve the efficiency.  Pulsed pointers (frequency
in the hundreds of Hz range or less) use a pulsed diode.
<p>
Note that since there is no real control of temperature, power output may
change significantly (up or down or both) for pointers using a constant
current driver, also called Automatic Current Control (ACC) if the
pointer is kept on for an extended period of time.  Most pointers have
used ACC drivers.  Usually, since pointers are really intended to be
used for brief periods of time for pointing at something, if any optimization
was done, the manufacturer would attempt to select the laser diode wavelength
to match the vanadate's absorption band when the components are cool.
As the laser diode heats up, its wavelength increases (about 0.3 nm/&deg;C)
and drifts away from the optimal value.  (Even though the absorption band is
quite broad, there may still be some noticeable effect.)  However, if the
wavelength was low to begin with, the power would increase as the wavelength
moved toward the peak absorption for the crystal and then decrease if it went
far enough.  From my experience with these as well as other basic green DPSS
lasers, unlike red laser pointers whose output is either constant or gradually
dropping in intensity until the batteries poop out, expect a modest amount of
slow cyclical and even possibly some sudden power fluctuations as the
temperature of key components increase and lasing characteristics change.
So, a typical green pointer may actually dip to less than 2/3rds of its
rated power at times, hitting the rated power only occasionally.  Apparently,
many may significantly exceed the rated power (and the legal limit) at
times if you happen to get lucky or unlucky, depending on your wishes.
Some of the newest green pointers use Automatic Power Control (APC) both to
get around the variability and excessive illegal power problems.  An angled
plate feeds a small portion of the output beam to a photodiode are used
in a feedback circuit to maintain the output power constant until
the batteries die.  Some may even seal the entire driver in hard Epoxy
or at least the power adjustment pot (if there is one) to make it more
difficult to "boost" the output power above the legal limit as some
people want.
<p>
And don't forget that just because the CDRH safety
sticker may say 5 mW max, your actual model may not come anywhere near that -
ever.  The <i>actual</i> power rating would be listed elsewhere.  But
providing it at all is rare, partially due to the fluctuation problem, but
mostly because the manufacturers figure you're better off not knowing how
mediocre the pointer realy is!
<p>
With the much higher prices for green pointers (at least in the past!),
make sure you get a decent
written warranty.  No, I really can't recommend a particular manufacturer or
model.  I'd suggest checking the archives of the usenet newsgroup
alt.lasers via <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</A> for
recent discussions the best green laser pointers to buy.
Prices are currently averaging about $250 (in 2001) though
I've seen some 3 mW models advertized on the Web for as little as $180,
lower on eBay).  And supposedly, though I haven't tried to buy one, there
is at least one company (<A HREF="http://www.leadlight.com.tw/">Leadlight
Technology, Inc.</A>, Taiwan) who will sell 1 to 3 mW green pointers for
as low as $88, quantity 1 (probably even lower by now).  And, I've seen
Chinese imports going for under $20, including shipping! (Summer, 2007)
<p>
Although some may
consider it unethical, ordering several pointers and only keeping the best
may be the only way to assure satisfactory performance as they are quite
variable in output and stability.  The additional complexity and more
delicate nature of the individual components means that reliability and
robustness may not be as good as for their red cousins (to the extent that
these are reliable and robust!).  This means that while those fancy polished
wood cases look impressive, transporting the pointer in a well padded case is
probably a better idea.  Comparing the detailed diagrams of a
<A HREF="lsrptr1.gif">Typical Red Laser Pointer</A> and
the <A HREF="l54-101.gif">Edmund Scientific L54-101 Green DPSS Laser
Pointer</A>, or the single diagram <A HREF="lptrcmp1.gif">Comparison of Red
and Green Laser Pointer Complexity</A>.  (The L54-101 was a $395 model
around 2002, but even so, it's amazing prices weren't a lot higher as
it has all the sophistication of a much more expensive DPSS laser.)
Even a failed switch just out of warranty (assuming there is a warranty
that will be honored in the first place!), can render a $300 pointer
useless since there is often no non-destructive way of getting inside
to repair it.  (And, I've heard that the switches they use on these
things are often not adequately rated for the much higher current
green laser pointers use compared to red ones.)  Of course, now (2008),
presentation-power class green lsaer pointers (i.e., 5 mW)
are more along the lines of $10 or $20, so a warranty might be luxury
from a bygone era. :)  They also use composite crystals instead of
discrete crystals so the complexity is somewhat lower as shown in
<A HREF="glpmca1.gif">Typical Green DPSS Laser Pointer Using MCA</A>.
<p>
For more information on DPSS lasers and green laser pointers including details
of the L54-101, see the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers</A>.
<p>
And, what about those other colors?  As a practical matter, there isn't much
need for anything beyond green since its wavelength (532 nm) is near the peak
(555 nm) of the human eye's response curve.  However, to impress those high
flying corporate executives, blue might be cool - but expect to spend a
$2,000 for one using DPSSFD technology that isn't as bright as a $5 red
pointer.  I think yellow would look nice on dark color slides, but the only
way to do this until recently would be to use a yellow HeNe laser (yep, they
come in yellow also!) as there are no yellow laser diodes.  However, at least
one company is now offering what they claim to be a yellow DPSS laser pointer.
See <A HREF="http://www.laserglow.com/">Laser Glow</A>.  No real data
available though.  It apparently uses sum-frequency mixing of the two
strongest lasing lines of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>.  The sum of the frequencies
for 1064 nm and 1342 nm corresponds to the listed 593.5 nm wavelength.
(1/1342+1/1064=1/593.5.)  So, they have the laser running simultaneously
at the two wavelengths by suitably coating the mirrors and use a non-linear
crystal (probably could be KTP) phase matched to do the summing.
Cute how the physics happens to work out. :)  Anyone volunteer to buy one?
See <b>U.S. Patent #5,802,086: Single Cavity Solid State Laser with Intracavity
Optical Frequency Mixing</b>.
<p>
Orange is a similar problem but there is no vanadate lasing line at a suitable
wavelength with adequate gain.  At the other end of the spectrum, violet
(which would be really hard to see) laser pointers using the Nichia violet
(400 to 415 nm) laser diodes could be built inexpensively like red ones since
the circuitry is about as simple - except for one minor detail: the cost of
these violet laser diodes is presently (February, 2001) still around $1,000
each!  A violet pointer might impress the corporate big-wigs also but due to
the lack of visibility, would be quite useless for presentations unless the
projection screen had a coating that glowed when hit by violet light.  Hmmm,
now that's an idea. :)
<p>
There are inexpensive LED-based key chain pointers in bright blue and other
colors but these are not true lasers and the divergence is typically 5 to 10
<i>degrees</i> instead of 1 or 2 milliradians (1 degree = 17 mR).  But, if
all you want to do is impress management types, that may be good enough. :)
<p>
And, no, there is currently no technology capable of producing a variable
color laser pointer.
<p>
So, now you should know the reasons that the only way to convert a red laser
pointer into a green one is to buy a bunch of red pointers for a low price,
sell them for a high price, and use the proceeds to purchase a green laser
pointer. :)

<h3><A NAME="dioapglp">Additional Precautions with Respect to Green DPSS Laser
 Pointers</A></h3>

Unfortunately, these usually don't come with any sort of useful user manual.
<p>
Much of the following applies to any laser pointer but especially to the
expensive green variety:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Avoid physical shock:</b> Due to the additional complexity and precise
 component alignment, green DPSS laser pointers are much more susceptible
 to damage from being dropped or wacked on a hard surface.
<p>
<li><b>Use ONLY the recommended power source:</b> Substituting a different
 battery type or external power supply may result in immediate damage or
 reduced life.  Without analyzing the driver circuit, there is no way to
 know for sure what is safe.
<p>
<li><b>Do NOT attempt to operate if very cold:</b> The pump output will be
 greater and the components and adhesives will be more brittle.  I don't know
 how to determine whether your pointer will be affected and at what precise
 temperature.  However, I've heard of the vanadate being shattered from
 operation at low temperatures.
<p>
<li><b>Do NOT attempt to disassemble the pointer:</b> At least, not if you
 value it as a working pointer.  While getting at the driver and DPSS module
 may be relatively low risk, taking the DPSS module apart is definitely to
 be avoided.  Damage is almost certain.
<p>
<li><b>Do NOT remove the IR filter:</b> A substantial amount of the 808 nm
 pump light can leak through to the output (10s of mW or more which is
 potentially dangerous) and this is nearly totally invisible and swamped by
 the green output.  Some totally invisible IR at 1,064 nm from the vanadate
 lasing process also leaks through the output mirror and its power may be
 similar to that of the green output!   The IR filter is typically a greenish
 piece of glass buried inside the collimating optics but on some models,
 unscrewing the end-cap also removes the IR filter.  The risk of the
 additional IR isn't worth the very slightly increased green output that
 may result.  It's best to avoid these models entirely or somehow make sure
 that the end-cap can never be left off accidentally.
<p>
 Some/many imported green pointers don't even have IR filters.  This
 of course is a serious safety hazard.  But, it also may result in bogus
 readings for green output power.  So, someone can claim "300 mW from this
 green pointer" without saying that 299 of those mW are IR! :)
<p>
 If you have a green laser pointer and some means of detecting IR, the 1064 nm
 beam will be almost in the same position and with similar collimation to the
 532 nm beam.  However, the difference in wavelength will result in a change in
 effective focus/divergence and there is a 4.5 mR walkoff from the KTP of
 532 nm beam with respect to the 1064 nm beam which will result in some
 discrepency in where they point.  The 808 nm beam will be highly
 divergent/diffuse but may be quite intense next to the output.  Note
 that an IR detector card will likely fluoresce due to the energetic
 532 nm light so a glow in the area of the beam itself is not
 necessarily an indication of serious IR leakage.
<p>
<li><b>Do NOT attempt any modifications to the driver:</b> While it is tempting
 to tweak up the drive current just a bit, or replace the pulsed driver with
 a CW one to get more power, my recommendation is to avoid any of this unless
 you won't mind turning your sleek green pointer into a sleek piece of junk.
</ul>
<p>
To improve reliability and extend operating time, it may be possible to mount
the guts of a green pointer in a different case.
Here's an example of the module from a green DPSS laser pointer that has
been repackaged by Dave (ws407c@aol.com) with enhancements by me (Sam)
into a little blue box.  Improvements include the use of AA instead of
AAA batteries, a better power switch, a cushioned mounting for the DPSS
module, and some genuine safety stickers.
See: <A HREF="glpmbb1.jpg">Green DPSS Laser Pointer Module Mounted in Little
Blue Box</A>.  For those contemplating doing what I recommend against, this
makes it easier to access the adjustment pot as well. :)

<h3><A NAME="diosulp">Comments on Souped Up Laser Pointers for Buyers and
 Sellers</A></h3>

You've probably seen the advertisements or eBay listings by now - or perhaps
you already own one - something along the lines of "OEM 60 mW Green DPSS Laser
Pointer".  Technically, this may be possible with some units, at least if you
don't care about stability, battery consumption, and short (possibly very
short!) lifetime, but how legal is it if the output power is actually above
5 mW which is supposed to be the maximum for any pointer available to the
general public?  The short answer is: It's not legal at all.  In fact, were
you to purchase one of these, even if it came anywhere close to the claimed
power (how many buyers actually have a laser power meter to check?!),
the CDRH sticker will probably still say "&lt;5 mW".  So if questioned,
perhaps the seller will say either that it is only for incorporation into a
product (thus the "OEM" which stands for "Original Equipment Manufacturer")
or that the higher power must have been the result of shipping damage.
Right. :)
<p>
Being able to significantly increase output power with an adjustment or
simple circuit modification only applies to green pointers.  Red ones will
just die if this is attempted much beyond 5 mW - a higher power laser diode
would be needed.
<p>
Note that as a matter of principle, I do not have detailed information on
boosting the output power of a laser pointer above 5 mW anywhere in this
document due to the fact that (1) it is illegal, (2) it is dangerous for the
user and others, and (3) any adjustment or modification is quite likely to
destroy the pointer or at least dramatically shorten its life.  However,
there is plenty of such info available on the Internet.  Use at your own risk.
<p>
As a practical matter, most of the pointers sold with an output power of
significantly more than 5 mW have either simply had their diode current
turned up, or had the diode replaced with a higher maximum power device.
In both cases, the lasing crystals are likely being overstressed and
inadequately cooled.  A rapid degradation or total failure is quite possible.
These are not $10,000 lab lasers, but $50 pointers on steroids.  Good luck
on getting warranty service. :)
<p>
In order to become more compliant with CDRH regulations, manufacturers are
being forced to modify their designs to assure that the output power never
exceeds the 5 mW limit at any time under any conditions, and to make it more
difficult for any modification to be performed that would violate the 5 mW
limit.  These techniques include eliminating any internal adjustments,
potting the driver circuitry in Epoxy, converting from a constant current
to a constant power driver, and using components that are funning closer
to their rated specifications.
<p>
For anyone considering the purchase or sale of a modified laser pointer,
here are a list of guidelines.  This applies to any color pointer as long
as it's based on a laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Laser pointers sold in (or to) the USA must have a power output
 of less than 5 mW.
<p>
<li>Using a modified laser pointer with a power output greater than 5 mW
 in public without a variance is a violation of CDRH rules.
<p>
<li>Selling modified pointers makes the modifier/seller a laser
 manufacturer and subject to CDRH rules.
<p>
<li>Selling a modified laser pointer with a power output greater than
 5 mW is also a violation of CDRH rules.  Some reputable companies now
 list pointers with a power output of 50 mW or more, claiming that because
 they have a keyswitch, emission indicator, and shutter, they are legal.
 Unless the CDRH rules have changed recently - which I highly doubt given
 the current climate with respect to terrorism and litigation - this doesn't
 help.
<p>
<li>Modifying a laser pointer so that it is capable of more than 5 mW
 output via a user accessible adjustment, but only selling it adjusted
 at less than 5 mW is still a violation of CDRH rules.
<p>
<li>Just calling a modified pointer an OEM device does not clear the seller
 of requirements to follow CDRH rules.
</ul>
<p>
While it would seem that despite the proliferation of modified green laser
pointers, any violations have thus far fallen below the threshold for action
by the CDRH, it won't take too many law suits to change this!
<p>
So, aside from bragging rights on having the most powerful laser pointer
on your block, what use are they?
<p>
<ul>
<li>Astronomy types claim they are better for pointing out stars and other
 celestial bodies in a dark sky since the actual beam path is more visible.
 However, 5 mW really should be adequate, if not ideal.
<p>
<li>There may be some forensic applications, though lasers designed with
 the appropriate safeguards and regulatory approvals exist for this purpose.
<p>
<li>They don't make good flashlights and are useless or worse as defensive
 weapons.  A $3 flashlight produces more light than the most boosted pointer
 and trying to use a laser of this type type against an armed intruder will
 probably result in a annoying hole appearing in some critical part of your
 anatomy.
<p>
<li>And due to their poor performance, boosted pointers are worthless for
 laser show or any other similar application.
<p>
<li>So that leaves bragging rights and personal satisfaction.  There is
 nothing illegal about admiring the photons in the privacy of your living
 room.  But a high power hand-held laser with a simple pushbutton switch
 is a truly dangerous toy even for the user.  And if someone else should
 ever suspect they were injured by the pointer - whether valid or not -
 the lawyers will pounce!
</ul>
<p>
(From: "Lynn Strickland" (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
A hand-held pointer over 5 mW is illegal to sell in the USA, period.  Regs
per IEC 825 in Europe are even tougher.  The CDRH hasn't caught up with
everyone yet, but the fines are big, and they'll force a product recall.  (If
you don't have records of who bought your product, ship dates and serial
numbers, you've got a second problem.)   Even pointers under 5 mW require a
"variance" document with respect to certain CDRH regulations, and require a
CDRH accession number.
<p>
Calling it an OEM product (with disclaimer of non-compliance) still doesn't
fly, because the law applies to any "removable laser system."  The only time
you can sell a non-compliant removable system is when you can site the
purchasers CDRH accession number for the end product.
<p>
Claiming "shipping damage that resulted in increased power" also doesn't
fly, because CDRH regs require designs in which system failure cannot
result in exceeding the specified classification.
<p>
Some have sold the laser 'head' and 'power supply' separately as a kit.  If
one can reasonably attach the pieces without specialist tools, etc. -- even
the KIT has to comply (and be certified, and have an accession number).
<p>
Having lived with these laws as a manufacturer, I can tell you that there
aren't any cute and clever loopholes.  Sooner or later they'll get your
number.  People will show up at your door and start packing your files and
PCs into the back of a white van with government plates, and you'll be
calling your attorney from your car phone, because they won't let you back
into your office.  It's like export regs, you can fly under the radar screen
for a while, but once they find you...
<p>
If you want to screw with the companies selling this stuff, ask for the CDRH
accession number for the product in question, along with any variance
numbers under which they are shipping the specified product.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
People who do not register as a manufacturer and who don't do a "product
report" and the import paperwork get clobbered big time. I know a fellow
who had $10K in legal bills for selling an "OEM part" without the stickers
and filing the reports.
<p>
It's not just a variance for most pointers, it's a manufacturer's initial
report, yearly report, and record keeping, very good record keeping,
for 7 years or so.
<p>
Now that Customs and CDRH are paired up, things are getting regularly
stopped, they publish a on line list of seizures  from time to time
and its very long!  And it isn't just little guys who get seized, there
are some serious big time companies who have problems.
<p>
What's illegal about the hopped up "OEM DEVICE" pointer is entering it
into commerce under (1) the illusion that the buyer will make/keep it
compliant and do any paperwork before reselling it and (2) that it's
entering into trade to someone who will not use it for its intended
purpose as a certified Class IIIa demonstration device. If they use it
in public when modified, then it's illegal.  If it's sold with intent
to modify it to beat the rules, then thats also illegal.

<h3><A NAME="dioclpm">The Benefits of Cheap Laser Pointers for
 Modulation</A></h3>

Ironically, many newer cheap laser pointers can be modulated at very high
rates by simply controlling the current from the batteries/power supply.  Why?
Because they don't have any power regulation and the super cheap Far
East imports have no filter capacitors at all.  Of course, you risk
blowing the laser diode if this isn't done carefully.  But, for the
typical pointer using 3, 1.5 V button cells, just feed it with a signal
clamped between 0 V (or around the 3 V lasing threshold) and +4.5 V capable
of supplying around 50 mA and it should be possible to generate a modulated
output up into the 100s of MHz range.  Use a frequency modulated carrier for
best audio or video performance.  See the additional comments below.
<p>
If all you want to do is adjust the power manually, just add a 100 ohm pot
in series with the battery.  On my tests of typical cheapo pointers, that
varies the power from just below lasing threshold to maximum.  Note that
the beam from LED emission below threshold is dim but still quite decent
in terms of divergence so it may be acceptable for applications that don't
require the narrow line width or coherence of a laser.
<p>
On those that do have decent regulators, modulation frequency may be limited
to a few Hz to a few hundred Hz depending on design and the actual output
power may be more of a triangular wave shape due to the soft start (ramp up,
ramp down) turn on, turn off behavior.
<p>
(From: John, K3PGP (k3pgp@qsl.net).)
<p>
The speed issue was true of many early (and pricey!) laser pointers which
used a feedback power regulator.  The capacitors and the feedback tended to
reduce the speed at which the laser could be turned on and off.
<p>
Now that the price has fallen everyone is competing to make them even cheaper.
What this means is that most laser pointers today have NO power regulator at
all.  What I've been finding is a laser diode, resistor, switch, and two 1.5
volt batteries in series.  Laser pointers like these can be modulated up into
the hundreds of Mhz as there is nothing to interfere with the speed at which
the laser can be turned on and off.
<p>
Of course you stand the risk of easily damaging the diode in laser pointers
like these with an overvoltage, spike, or static electricity if you don't
use some common sense and are not careful when bringing wires out and hooking
the laser pen to external circuitry.
<p>
Since we are dealing with a wide variety of styles and manufacturers, there
will be some differences.  For instance I've seen a few that have no power
regulator, just a resistor to the 3 volt battery supply, BUT have an
electrolytic capacitor across the diode.  It was necessary to remove the
capacitor to allow the laser to be switched at high speed.

<h3><A NAME="diodlm3">Difference Between Diode Laser Modules and Laser
 Pointers</A></h3>

A collimated diode laser module and pocket laser pointer both produce a spot
of light.  So why the typical huge difference in price?
<p>
The simple answer is: It all depends. :)  There can be variability in any type
of product.  While the desired output of a laser pointer and collimated diode
laser module is similar, how fussy the end-user is and how one gets there may
not be:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Laser pointers are mass produced so this helps reduce costs. They generally
 have less complex and less robust drive electronics since the power source
 is supposedly well defined - a set of batteries.  There may be no corrective
 optics for the astigmatism and elliptical aberrations of the typical laser
 diode - at a distance, your spot isn't a nice round Gaussian profile.  There
 is probably just a single cheap plastic lens glued in place, though some
 models do have adjustable focus.
<p>
<li>Diode laser modules are more of a specialty item used inside other
 equipment and for optics research and development.  Production volumes are
 not as high.  They usually (but not always) have high quality driver circuits
 designed to protect the sensitive laser diode from moderate abuse - noisy
 power, for example.  Many have high quality optics including additional
 elements for correction of the laser diode aberrations.  They usually have
 adjustable focus.
</ul>
<p>
In the end, it is probably the mass production that is the most significant
factor in keeping costs down.
<p>
There is also another difference between the two which relates to output power:
<p>
<ul>
<li>For a laser pointer, the power rating - if it can be believed at all - is
 a maximum you might see with fresh batteries under the right conditions on a
 very good day, or possibly just the 5 mW maximum for Class IIIa (which is the
 most that is legal in the USA for a laser pointer).  Obviously, the seller
 wants to impress you with the specs for their product and not all are being
 entirely honest or forthcoming.  The actual power could be much less and may
 decrease rapidly as the batteries are drained.
<p>
<li>For a diode laser module (from a reputable manufacturer at least), the
 power rating is likely to either be what they actually measured for that
 sample or a guaranteed minimum value after warmup (power goes down with
 increasing laser diode temperature), or after some number of hours of
 operation.  Thus, the actual output power could be much more under some set
 of conditions.  The CDRH safety sticker will still list an upper bound but it
 will likely be much higher than the module's power rating.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="diosidl">Sources for Inexpensive Diode Laser Modules</A></h3>

Unless you find a really good deal on excess inventory or the like, the guts
of laser pointers are probably the cheapest source of decent quality diode
laser modules for many applications.  These are mass produced so cost can be
quite low.  There are many suppliers who will sell you just the laser diode in
a brass mount with adjustable collimating lens and attached driver circuit on
a tiny PCB for under $10 for a single unit, less in larger quantities.
<p>
These aren't likely to be in the same league as the $300 diode laser modules
from Edmund Scientific or even $100 units from other sources which will meet
or exceed all specifications and have protection against all reasonable abuse,
for the price, they can't be beat!
<p>
With respect to specifications:
<ul>
<li>At rated voltage, they may not put out more than 2 or 3 mW, maybe less,
 even if 5 mW is claimed.  But, you may be able to push them higher by
 tweaking the on-board pot some provide, or by running on slightly higher
 input voltage.  CAUTION: your mileage may vary and you risk blowing out the
 laser diode or driver - See the additional information in the section starting
 with: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodlm">Diode Laser Modules and Laser
 Pointers</A>.  (These may not have a driver that regulates for input voltage
 though most do use the monitor photodiode for optical feedback power control.)
<p>
<li>The wavelength may be optimistic - somewhat longer (more towards the red/IR
 and less bright than advertised).  For example, I measured one model that
 claimed 650 nm but was actually around 657 nm.
</ul>

See the suppliers listed in the chapter: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser
and Parts Sources</A>.

<h3><A NAME="diodlm4">How to Determine if You Have a Diode Laser
 Module</A></h3>

So you found a bag of cute little brass devices marked 'barcode lasers' at a
garage sale.  They have wires coming out of one end and a lens at the other.
Are they bare laser diodes or do they have a built in driver circuit?  Size
alone is no real indication as the driver circuits can be quite tiny.

<ul>
<li>If there is any sort of model number, try to check that out first since as
 we have seen, laser diodes are not very forgiving of even minor abuse.
<p>
<li>If you really have a *bag* of the thingies, the surest way to know what is
 inside is to sacrifice one and reverse engineer it - unless, of course, they
 are totally potted in Epoxy or something even more impervious to 20th century
 technology.  Perhaps your friendly dentist would be willing to X-ray one
 for you (with or without root canal). :)
</ul>

Assuming that analyzing the circuit isn't possible or appealing and they are
not clearly labeled (in which case you wouldn't be reading this anyhow),
closely examine the wire leads:

<ul>
<li>If there are three solid gold plated wires and they connect directly to the
 bottom of what looks like a metal can transistor, you have a bare laser diode.
 This sort of diode laser module without driver circuitry is common in
 equipment like laser printers and barcode scanners.  Some laser diodes only
 have two wires but not the kind you are likely to run across in a grab bag
 unless one broke off. :-)  If you cannot tell where they go, also assume you
 have a bare laser diode.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpstoc">Laser
 Diode Power Supplies</A> to determine their electrical characteristics and
 power requirements
<p>
<li>If there are only two wires, probably stranded and color coded red and
 black, there is almost certainly an internal driver circuit.  Red will be
 positive.  A typical power requirement is 3 to 12 VDC at 100 mA.  Start
 low while monitoring output (using an IR detector if it may be an IR laser
 diode).  Most diode laser modules operate at a fixed maximum output power
 which will be where the intensity stops increasing as you raise input voltage.
 You can probably assume the circuit will handle, say, 25 percent more input
 voltage beyond this point but there is no way to how much more without
 reverse engineering or testing the unit to destruction.  The power curve will
 also probably be quite non-linear - starting out as an LED until the
 threshold current is reached and then increasing rapidly.
<p>
 CAUTION: Some diode laser modules are current controlled using optical
 feedback but expect a regulated DC power supply input.  With these, the
 output will continue to increase more or less linearly as the input is
 cranked up until the point at which the smoke comes out. :-(
<p>
<li>If there are three (or more) stranded color coded wires, the additional
 ones may be for on-off control, modulation, or a shield or ground.  Have fun
 determining exactly what they do (but be prepared for frustration).
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="dioblpo">Brightest Laser Pointer for Outdoor Use?</A></h3>

A laser pointer is a bright source of light but so is the Sun. :)
<p>
The maximum legal limit for power output from any laser pointer in the USA
is 5 mW - Class IIIa (there may also be more restrictive local regulations and
it's lower in some other countries).  The best color to use is green since the
wavelength of modern green laser pointers based on Diode Pumped Solid State
(DPSS) laser technology (532 nm) is very near the peak of human visual
sensitivity (555 nm).  Thus, a 5 mW green laser pointer produces nearly the
brightest beam allowable by law (about 0.9 relative to 555 nm).  (Although
older green laser pointers based on green helium-neon lasers were a bit
closer at 543.5 nm, one capable of 5 mW would be almost a meter long and
weigh several kilograms with the required backpack mounted battery and high
voltage power supply.)  Whether the beam is pulsed or continuous doesn't make
much difference.  However, the spot from a low divergence beam may be somewhat
more visible at a distance on a brightly illuminated surface (see below).
The difference between a 4 or 5 mW pointer isn't really that significant
(it's barely detectable even with two pointers side-by-side), and as a
practical matter due to the technology, output may vary by as much as 30
percent (up, down, or in a cycle) as components heat during use.
<p>
So, if even 5 mW of green isn't bright enough, the optimal solution would be
to control the ambient illumination by putting a dimmer on the Sun. :)  If
this isn't an affordable option, the best that can be done is to use a screen
or whatever that is a light color and has a diffuse surface, and orient it to
avoid direct Sunlight.  Unfortunately, if there is no way to control any of
this as would be the case with use by an outdoor tour guide, there are no good
solutions.  Even the best laser pointers have a divergence no better than
about 1 milliradian (1 part in 1,000) so the power density of a 5 mW green
spot projected on a surface more than a few meters away drops well below
that of the 0.5 to 1 mW per square millimeter of Sunlight.  Even the pure
green color of the laser pointer will be quickly overwhelmed by the ambient
illumination.

<h3><A NAME="diodlm5">Can I Boost the Power Output of a Laser Pointer or
 Diode Laser Module?</A></h3>

The quick answer is: Probably not, or at least, not by much.
<p>
I know that in your fantasies, you have dreamed about the possibility of
creating a burning laser or Star Wars style light saber from a laser pointer.
Unfortunately, neither of these is even possible theoretically.  The best you
could ever hope for would be to obtain at most 5 mW from a device currently
outputting 2 or 3 mW.
<p>
While it might be feasible to increase the current to the laser diode, unless
you know its specifications AND have an accurate laser power meter (mucho $$$),
there is no way of knowing when to quit.  Above their rated maximum optical
power, laser diodes turn into DELDs (Dark Emitting Laser Diodes) or expensive
LEDs.  Exceed this rating for even a microsecond and your whimpy 3 mW output
may be boosted to precisely 0.0 mW.  This is called Catastrophic Optical
Damage (COD) to the microscopic end-facets of the laser diode.  There can be
also be thermal runaway problems or a combination of both of these depending
on design - or lack thereof.  However, if you have a bag of these gadgets and
are willing to blow a few, here are some guidelines:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Diode laser modules almost always have an internal current regulator using
 optical feedback to stabilize power output.  With these, the only hope of
 changing the output power is to get at, and adjust or modify this regulator
 circuitry.  If the unit is fully potted, you can basically forget about doing
 this.  If the driver board is accessible, there may be a control to adjust or
 resistor to change that sets power output.  See the chapter:
 <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpstoc">Diode Laser Power Supplies</A> for more details
 and sample circuits.
<p>
<li>Laser pointers may or may not have an internal regulator.  There is no way
 of telling from physical appearance and the pedigree of a typical laser
 pointer is often unknown - even if sold by a reputable dealer.  Price may be
 an indication (more expensive may imply better circuitry) but there no way to
 know for sure.  However, a simple test or observation can probably determine
 this:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>If the brightness of the laser beam (the spot on a wall - don't look into
  it!) is IDENTICAL whether you use a fresh set of batteries or ones that are
  slightly used, it also has an internal regulator and the comments above with
  respect to diode laser modules apply.  (I am not referring to normal decrease
  in brightness when the batteries become nearly dead - but obvious changes
  even near their beginning of life.)
<p>
  Where there is an internal regulator and adjustment pot, turning it may
  increases the brightness initially.  However, as the laser diode heats up
  over a few seconds or minutes, its output with respect to current decreases
  and the regulator will keep increasing the current to compensate - a runaway
  condition which can also result in damage or death to the laser diode.  A
  large heat sink, active (e.g., Peltier or heat-pipe) cooling, or dunking in
  liquid nitrogen may help if you are really determined to get every last
  photon from your laser pointer or diode laser module! :)  (I've heard of
  people getting truly spectacular amounts of light out of laser diodes cooled
  to liquid nitrogen temperatures, at least for a short time.)
<p>
 <li>If, on the other hand, brightness is a strong function of the battery age
  and type, even for nearly new cells, there is probably no internal regulator
  and using a **slightly** higher voltage power source **may** increase optical
  power without blowing the laser diode.  Since there is no regulator, what
  circuitry is present, was probably hand trimmed or adjusted for the
  particular laser diode so that a fresh set of the recommended batteries
  produce a safe (from the point of view of the laser diode) output level.
  However, there may be some margin to play with - or there may not.  If you
  feel lucky, go for it!
<p>
  However, another risk, is that after having painstakingly set the current
  or resistance or whatever for a brighter output, the next time you turn it
  on, the laser diode may blow!  The reason is that when cold, as noted above,
  the optical output of a laser diode is greater for a given current and may
  exceed what the laser diode facets can tolerate even if it was well within
  safe limits with the laser diode warmed up.  With no optical feedback, there
  is no protection against this possibility
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
But, in any case, how will you know when to quit before the laser diode is
irreversibly damaged?  And, in addition to exceeding the maximum rated output
power as you crank up the laser diode current, an electrostatic discharge, a
voltage spike from an external power supply, a noisy power adjust pot, or the
phase of the moon on an alternate Tuesday, may be enough to blow it!  By the
time you notice a problem, it will likely be far too late for the health of
your poor little defenseless laser diode!
<p>
This really IS like playing Russian Roulette and my serious recommendation
would be to leave well enough alone.  Save for a more powerful unit or even
just a 635 nm laser pointer if your current model is 670 nm (which will appear
at least 5 times brighter for the same output power).
<p>
If you do insist on modifying the circuitry, use an antistatic wrist strap,
grounded temperature controlled soldering iron, and the proper desoldering
equipment (if needed).  At least then, you'll know that it was more likely
the changes to the circuit that blew out the laser diode, not your rework
technique. :)
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct">Determining
Characteristics and Testing of Laser Diodes</A> and those starting with:

Drive, Cooling</A>.
<p>
The same basic comments apply to boosting the output power of expensive green
laser pointers (but of course there is much more to lose).  The adjustment
may vary current or for those that are pulsed (which are most of them),
the duty cycle instead.  With no thermal management, stability is likely to
be significantly worse at higher power even if the laser diode survives.
However, since 3 mW and 5 mW pointers may be physically identical inside and
out, I don't know whether they are sorted on the basis of power output before
labeling or is just a matter of the setting of the power adjust pot - it
probably depends on manufacturer/model.
<p>
Having said that, I've heard of this being successful and I've also heard of
at least one sample of a green laser pointer producing 36 mW out of the box. :)
The vanadate/KTP crystals should be capable of much more than 5 mW, at least
for awhile.  However, in the samples I've seen, the discrete vanadate is
mounted by just two tiny dabs of adhesive which could easily come unglued
if the crystal gets hot (which it would with higher pump power).  Green
pointers using composite (e.g., CASIX) crystals would eventually suffer from
the dark spot problem in the glue used to hold them together.  There are
instances of very "lively" pointers where just tweaking the OC mirror could
result in increased power if not optimally adjusted originally.  I'd consider
this the exception though.  Most likely, boosting power would require
higher current to the pump diode which will result in shorter life or no
life at all!
<p>
(From: HippyLaserTek (hippylasertek@aol.com).)
<p>
Since the switch died in my green pointer, I said what the hell, and gave it a
shot.  (For crying out loud, why don't they replace the switch with a soft
touch type like in a calculator and a saturation driven transistor! Hell at
$200 to $300 a pop that's the LEAST they can do!)
<p>
Well I didn't expect 50 mW out at reasonable currents but I DID get around 15
mW of green out just by carefully tweaking on the three setscrews which
adjust the OC mirror position.  The only sacrifice was a slight decrease in
beam quality so it looks oval instead of round, but for a pointer module, who
cares anyway.
<p>
It was cool not only seeing that kind of power from the pointer, but the mode
patterns as well were rather interesting too. Some of the patterns were very
beautiful. By turning the current up from it's original 400 mA to 450 mA, it
topped 25 mW, the max my low power laser meter reads! It's rated for HeNe
light, so i don't think it responds the same for green. I think it gives a
false low reading though, I KNOW it does for blue.  (This is true for a
typical silicon photodiode, possibly as much as 20 to 25 percent reduction
at 532 nm compared to 632.8 nm. --- Sam.)
<p>
Going the other way I got green threshold at a mere 140 mA and "rated power"
of 4.8 mW at around 250 mA. I'd LOVE to install a 2 watter pump diode in place
of the 0.5 W? (tested at 0.4 W at 400 mA on my Ophir power meter set on
shg/dye/argon setting) pump diode in it. I am fairly certain with that diode
pumping the DPSS laser guts it would EASILY give out 75 to 100 mW.  (See
cautions, above. --- Sam.)
<p>
Other things of interest is the 1,064 nm IR was negligible in power, only about
0.03 mW and IS NOT BLOCKED BY THE LITTLE BLUE FILTER. When at 85 to 90 &deg;F
pump diode leakage was negligible also, but if it's cold, say 55 &deg;F pump
leakage was over 50 mW but this IS blocked by the filter. It is also blocked
by the filter in my power meter too so I had to remove it to take a reading. 
(The power meter probably also reads load at 1,064 nm. --- Sam.)
<p>
Despite the high power, this is not quite as much of a hazard as this was right
at the output of the brass part, by the time it reaches the output lens it is
reduced to only 7 mW or so and diverges very fast. The YAG beam is concentric
with the green beam. 
<p>
The laser's life as a pointer is over, but it is turned into a nice module. I
replaced the cheap lens in it with a nice 1/2" diameter lens assembly from a
target designator. The assembly also gives it the badly needed heat sinking the
module calls for. The best part is though the beam is now about 1/4" diameter it
has SERIOUS range and can go 25 feet and still be about the same size!

<h3><A NAME="diowaur">What About Using Rechargeable Batteries in a Laser
 Pointer?</A></h3>

This probably only makes any sense for power hungry green laser pointers since
the batteries in red ones should last a long time due to their lower current
drain (about 1/5th to 1/10th that of greens).
<p>
The problem with using NiCd or NiMH cells to replace Alkaline types is that
since the voltage is lower (1.2 V/cell versus 1.5 V/cell when fresh), the
output may not be as bright if the pointer doesn't include decent regulation
or its compliance range is inadequate.  Thus, it will be necessary to adjust
or change whatever is used for current control in your pointer so it provides
the proper current to the laser diode at the lower operating voltage of the
rechargeable batteries.  Note, however, that since the A-hr capacity of
rechargeables is less than that of Alkalines, lasing time will be reduced if
they are used.  (This is somewhat compensated by the flatter discharge curve
of NiCds and NiMH cells and your mileage may vary.)  Of course, you risk
blowing the circuitry and/or laser diode should you then install Alkalines,
so you may not be able to easily go back to them.  As with the other comments
on modifications to laser pointers, this is quite risky both in terms of
possible damage to the laser diode as well as being able to make any
modifications to the teeny tiny circuit board if needed.
<p>
I've have heard of people (apparently with money to burn), successfully doing
this with a green ($$$) laser pointer.  They changed the value of the resistor
used to set the laser diode current and were able to get slightly more power
at the same time (expected life unknown).  (Interestingly, at the original
power, the beam was TEM00; with increased power, it became multimode.)

<h3><A NAME="dioextp">Using an External Power Supply or Wall Adapter for a Laser Pointer</A></h3>

The quick answer is positively maybe. :)
<p>
For a red laser pointer which already has an internal driver circuit (not just
a resistor), replacing the batteries with a regulated DC power supply
having the same voltage as the batteries should work.  Or, simply using
external D cells instead of the internal AA or AAA or watch batteries
will work wonders for on-time.  If there is already a driver inside the laser
pointer, the quality of the DC power isn't that critical but don't use
an unregulated wall adapter since its output voltage may be double or more
of the listed value when lightly loaded and it may also have a lot of ripple.
But one that is properly regulated should be fine.  If in doubt, measure the
output voltage of the candidate adapter.  It should be very close to the
nameplate value if regulated.
<p>
This should also work for green pointers since their drivers tend to be
of decent quality.  However, with the higher current they use, thermal issues
become important and running some for more than a few seconds or minutes may
result in overheating and if not damage, at least a reduction in output power
and/or wild power fluctuations.  Of course, given the higher cost of green
pointers, there is more risk involved in any case.
<p>
For the really cheap red laser pointers with no regulator, an external DC
power supply can also be used but make sure it doesn't do nasty things
like spike or reverse polarity on power cycling.  And, regulation is even
more important.
<p>
One caution is that there may be cases where the internal resistance of
the intended batteries provide part of the regulation.  This is unlikely
to be an issue with red laser pointers using AAA or AA cells.  But with
watch batteries, it's possible.

<h3><A NAME="diodlm6">Can I Increase the Life of a Laser Pointer?</A></h3>

While the typical 5 mW laser diode may have a specified life in excess of
100,000 hours (8 years, yeah, sure!), one often finds that the $6.95 variety
of laser pointers last a whole lot less than 8 years. :)  It isn't possible to
provide a universal procedure that will get the most life from any laser
pointer.  However, knowing that excessive current and singular overcurrent
events ruin laser diodes should provide a basis for some recommendations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Run at less than maximum output.  With a really cheapo design, this can be
 done by adding a small resistor in series with the batteries (a few ohms).
 Just enough to result in a noticeable decrease in brightnness.  Yes, I know,
 you selected the thing based on the absolutely highest intensity you could
 find and want every photon of it!).  For those with regulators, this may still
 be beneficial since it will reduce the stress on the regulator components.
<p>
<li>Minimize on/off cycles.  If you are running with an external power supply,
 consider leaving it on rather than pulsing it everytime you want a beam.
 Even with batteries, some compromise between battery life and laser pointer
 life may be worthwhile.
<p>
<li>Redesign the regulator or add your own. :)  This is left as an exercise for
 student!
</ul>
<p>
You may be better off buying a better quality diode laser module as they will
have the necessary current regulator using optical feedback and other laser
diode protection circuitry.  While diode laser modules are generally much more
expensive than cheap laser pointers, there are some that are cheaper than
fancy laser pointers (which still may be low quality inside).  Got that? :-)

<h3><A NAME="diodelp">Electrical Modulation of a Laser Pointer or Diode Laser
 Module</A></h3>

For applications like communications, and laser shows, the output of the
laser must be able to be modulated, possibly at a high frequency.  Where
a system is being designed from scratch, this capability is straightforward,
though not necessarily easy, to include.  However, what about modulating
an existing system?  The answer really depends on how <i>it</i> was designed.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cheap laser pointers with no current regulator:</b>  Ironically, these
 may be easiest to modulate.  The Far East imports generally don't even include
 any filter capacitors so applying a suitable signal as the power input should
 permit very high speed modulation.  The driver must be able to supply
 the required operating current and be protected agains overshoot but beyond
 that, the laser diode will ultimately limit the bandwidth.
<p>
<li><b>Laser pointers or diode laser modules with regulator:</b>  These
 generally include some filtering on the power input, possibly large enough
 to limit modulation via switching power on and off to a few Hz.  It may be
 possible to remove, or reduce the size of the filter capacitors, but this
 must be done with care since the laser diode protection may depend on the
 value of these relative to the capacitance of the laser diode or attached
 to the laser diode.  The result may be a very quickly dead laser.
<p>
 Another technique which is best for high speed modulation is to add a
 direct input via a resistor (both directions) or resistor and diode (one
 direction) to add or subtract current from the laser diode.  The optical
 feedback wlll attempt to maintain a constant output power but since that
 is generally heavily filtered, will not respond fast modulation.  Of course,
 care must be taken to assure that the maximum current can never exceed
 the rated value for the laser diode.
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(From: Tom Becker.)
<p>
 "I've been using a technique that has worked without failure for a long
  time, on both a 5 mW 635 nm module and a 40 mW 780nm module with an
  appropriate resistor change.  It simply steals laser diode current,
  allowing the automatic power control to function normally.  This permits
  modulation at megahertz rates.  I've used it to carry a 10 MHz serial
  data-stream.  See <A HREF="tbldmod1.gif">Tom Becker's Diode Laser Module
  Modulation Modification</A>.  The original you'll recognize as very common -
  with my modifications asterisked."
</blockquote>
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode modules with modulation input</b>  There are two types of
 modulation that may be supported: Analog and digital.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>With analog modulation, the output intensity should be related to input
  voltage between limits.  For example, a 0 to 1 V signal may result in an
  output between that varies between 1 and 10 mW.  The limits may be
  adjustable (gain and offset).  A maximum modulation frequency may be
  specified but unless the datasheet explicitly lists what this means, it
  could be at the 3dB point, some other reduction in output amplitude, where
  the output can no longer swing fully on and fully off, or something else.
  Where the input is AC coupled, there will also be a lower limit greater
  than DC/CW.
<p>
 <li>With digital modulation (often specified for TTL input levels, 0 V for
  a logic 0 and +3 to +5 V for a logic 1), the output can be controlled
  between two intensities.  These may be adjustable.  What happens in between
  the logic 0 and 1 input levels is undefined.  There will usually be a
  maximum modulation rate specified which may be a frequency or a minimum
  high/low pulse duration.
 </ul>
<p>
 There is no standard for either type of modulation.  The only way to know
 for sure what the specs really mean is to contact the manufacturer and hope
 they know what the specs really mean. :)
</ul>
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.scitoys.com/">Science Toys</A> has some suggestions
for doing this on their

a good chance what's in your junk drawer will work just fine with a Dollar
Store laser pointer.

<h3><A NAME="diodolp">Optical Modulation of a Laser Pointer or Diode Laser
 Module</A></h3>

It's a cute idea: Introduce an external light source to 'fool' the internal
optical feedback circuit into thinking that the laser power is higher than
it should be.  The driver will then cut back on current to compensate.
If you shine certain laser pointers at a mirror, their output will drop
dramatically.  However, this effect may be due to the monitor photodiode
sensing the added light and cutting back on laser diode current, or
due to light getting inside the laser diode cavity and messing up lasing.
Apparently, the latter effect as unlikely as it sounds, may be the one that
is more likely, at least with certain models.
<p>
One way to tell which effect is causing the change in output power is to
measure the laser diode current: If it drops with the reflection, the cause
is likely the simple optical feedback mechanism.  If on the other hand it
increases, then laser instability is likely.  Also see the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioclpo">Causes of Laser Pointer Output Power Changing
When Directed at a Mirror</A>.
<p>
Even if the photodiode sensitivity is the cause, several factors conspire
against this being a viable technique in general (though it may work with
specific devices):

<ul>
<li>The monitor photodiode (PD) is deliberately made quite insensitive since
 it 'sees' about the same amount of light as is produced at the laser diode's
 output but from the rear facet.  So, it's bathed in light which is quite
 strong compared to anything that could be introduced externally unless it is
 another laser.
<p>
<li>Hitting the PD would also be quite a challenge.  Although it is relatively
 large at least in comparison to the laser diode (LD) chip, it sits behind it
 and may be partially blocked.  So, any external source would have to
 adjusted to focus on the PD <i>after</i> passing though the collimating lens
 of the laser pointer or diode laser module.
<p>
<li>The laser diode drive circuitry likely includes some amount of filtering
 using large capacitors.  This would seriously limit the frequency response.
</ul>
<p>
And, if it is actually a lasing interference effect, good luck succeeding in
getting anything to be repeatable or stable unless you have a granite block
or sand-box holography setup. :)
<p>
If you still insist on experimenting, be aware that while this appears to be
safe for the laser diode, there is no way of knowing for sure without tests.
There could be funny resonances in the driver that will blow your laser diode
at certain frequencies!  And, if the effect is due to lasing instability,
the regulator may attempt to boost the current to compensate resulting in
possible overheating of the laser diode, driver, or both.
<p>
My informal experiments have turned up both effects, one of each for a couple
of laser pointers and quite noticeable photodiode based power suppression with
an NVG D660-5 (just happened to be one I tried) on an optical feedback
regulated driver - shining a laser pointer into the laser diode window resulted
in almost total supression of lasing.  I suspect that the pointer affected
by interference inside the cavity went into overcurrent or thermal shutdown
(as it refused to lase at all for several seconds after the test).  And, a few
days later, it was obvious that the output power had decreased and the beam
pattern was messed up, a sure indication of facet damage, which probably
happened immediately but I just didn't notice it.

<h3><A NAME="dioclpo">Causes of Laser Pointer Output Power Changing When
 Directed at a Mirror</A></h3>

The following discussion resulted from the claim (mine and others) that
reflecting the output of a laser pointer or diode laser module from a mirror
might result in a decrease in output if it had optical feedback for power
regulation.  On one laser pointer I have, there is absolutely no effect.  On
another, output power drops by at least 50 percent.  My assumption was that
it was the light reflected back and falling on the monitor photodiode that
caused the effect and not some weird interference to the lasing process.  But
given what is described below, I'll concede that in many cases, it may indeed
be the latter.
<p>
It does seem that relatively low reflected power back to the laser diode can
affect lasing.  This has been used to advantage in narrowing the line width
of common laser diodes with an external cavity.  See, for example,
<b>U.S. Patent #4,907,237: Optical Feedback Locking of Semiconductor
Lasers</b>.
<p>
One way to tell which effect is causing the change in output power is to
measure the laser diode current: If it drops with the reflection, the cause
is likely the simple optical feedback mechanism.  If on the other hand it
increases, then laser instability is likely.
<p>
However, suppose the returning beam hits the monitor photodiode.  Since the
outgoing and return beams are mutually coherent, interference fringes will be
formed on the surface of the photodiode.  If they are large enough as
they would be with very good alignment of the outgoing and return beams, and a
minima were to dominate the surface area, the feedback circuit would think
that the power was too low and increase current - possibly to destructive
levels.
<p>
Another possibility is that the return beam from the mirror precisely hits
the output facet of the laser diode.  While this is a very small area, it
only needs to happen for an instant.  The result is an extended cavity
which suddenly has a much lower loss due to the higher reflectance of the
external mirror compared to the cleaved facet.  The result is a virtually
instantaneous increase in intracavity power and if the laser was running close
to the COD (Catastrophic Optical Damage) limit, poof goes the laser diode.
This would be more likely with a constant current driver but even in constant
power mode, the increase in intracavity power would take place in less than
1 nanosecond - much less than the response time of the feedback circuit.
<p>
One variable that can be played with in any experiments of this type is
the divergence of the beam: A collimated beam will be much more likely
to result in interference or instability effects as it will be returned
with virtually the same wavefront.
<p>
Adding a polarizer or polarizing beamsplitter aligned with the diode
polarization followed by a quarter wave plate would suppress most
back reflections.  A very expensive optical isolator would eliminate
them almost entirely.
<p>
CAUTION: I have both first hand experience of damage to a laser pointer
diode and have also heard of diode failure from others
that may have resulted from these sorts of experiments.
A very nice laser pointer I have never quite recovered after seeing
its reflection and is now operating at about 1/4 power with very
noticeable facet damage.  Others have reported instantaneous
damage to single mode (TEM00) laser diodes from reflections
having eliminated other possible causes.  High power (e.g., 35 mW
and above) seem particularly vulnerable.
<p>
(From: John, K3PGP (k3pgpalltel.net).)
<p>
This is pretty much my findings here also.
<p>
However, since laser pens seem to be built as cheaply as possible there are
NO standards!  What works with one may not work with another.  This has
caused me untold grief when trying to discuss most anything about laser
pens!
<p>
I have a few laser pens here that go nuts when you aim them at a mirror.
With some pointers the mirror has to be precisely aligned much the same as
the mirrors at the ends of the laser cavity itself.  With others the
alignment isn't as critical.  These same pens seem to be unaffected by other
light sources shining back into the laser including light from another laser
pen with the same approximate wavelength.
<p>
I think the important fact to those those units that were affected is
whether or not the incoming radiation was precisely the same frequency as
the oscillation in the laser cavity.  When this experiment is set up with a
pen that is sensitive to this effect, EVERYTHING affects the setup, even the
slightest vibration which makes sense (to me anyway!).  It kind of reminds
me of the Michelson Interferometer or a holographic setup.   I assume this
interference effect is the same effect noticed with many HeNe lasers where
no power sensing diode is involved.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
That would seem to confirm the hypothesis that interference with the lasing
process is taking place, at least for those cases.  I'm surprised they would
be so sensitive.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
These pens seem to be somewhat rare though as most of the laser pens that I
have don't seem to care what you shine back at them.  Since laser pens
differ so widely from one manufacturer to the next and even between
identical model numbers from the same manufacturer I'm not sure if the
differences are being caused by the use of different laser diodes or perhaps
this effect is somewhat critical as to the amount of current passing through
the laser diode or something else?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Conceivably, the sensitive laser diodes are being operated on the verge of
mode hopping or something like that but I'm more inclined to believe it is
just a sample to sample variation or laser diode model dependent.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
When trying this experiment with several different HeNe lasers I've also
noticed that some are effected to a much larger extent than others.  I'm not
sure why this is.  Maybe it has something to due with the gas mixture, the
pressure, the current passing through the tube, or what else?
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Also mirror reflectivity and curvature.  The gas mixture, pressure, and
current are probably less of an issue as long as it is running somewhere
around the correct conditions.
<p>
When you reflect a beam back into a HeNe laser, it's only .5 to 2 percent of
the strength of the output beam and order of .01 percent of the strength of
the circulating photon flux inside the tube <b>unless</b> the external mirror
is very close to being parallel to the output mirror.   Then, there will be
multiple bounces and much of the light makes it back to the cavity...  Hmmm.
The distance also matters due to interference effects and the curvature of the
mirrors affect the shape of the wavefront.  Possibly HeNe lasers with close to
planar mirrors are more sensitive to this.  However, just the light bouncing
back and forth and interfering with itself <i>outside</i> the cavity can
confuse the observations.  What a mess. :)

<h3><A NAME="diodiss">Disassembling a Laser Pointer</A></h3>

In the old days before the dinosaurs roamed the Earth and even before cell
phones, laser pointers may have been constructed in a such a way that they
could be taken apart and put back together again.  Regrettably, that is no
longer the case.  Among your options are a hacksaw, lathe, hammer, and
Dynamite - or something stronger. :)  It can be done but don't expect to get
the pieces together again, at least not in an aesthetic package.
<p>
For red laser pointers, note that some/many/most of the newest and cheapest
imports may not even use a packaged laser diode - the bare chip is attached
directly to a metal header next to the lens.  I wouldn't be too optimistic
about repair or reuse of one of those.
<p>
The deconstruction process for a typical green (DPSSFD) laser
pointer - a much more complex device than the red variety - is shown in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.47
or higher) under "Dissection of Green Laser Pointer".

<h3><A NAME="diolppr">Problems with Really Cheap Laser Pointers</A></h3>

I couldn't resist picking up 23 supposedly dead key chain-style laser pointers
on eBay.  These were supposedly "dealer returns" which could mean anything
from the buyer didn't know how to insert the batteries to they were used for
1,000 presentations and then taken back to the store with a claim of being
defective (yes a few were obviously well worn). :)  They are the type that
come with zillions of pattern heads (actually 5 to 12 including the only
one that is useful - the clear one), just use a resistor to limit current
to the laser diode (no driver) from the 3 watch-style button cells, and
were all made in China, probably by the same manufacturer.  While there were
minor variations in case styles, they were all similar in construction to
<A HREF="slasptr.jpg">Components of Simplest Red Laser Pointer</A> internally.
<p>
Despite their simplicity, the power and beam quality are generally comparable
to the older more complex red laser pointers, though the overall manufacturing
quality and consistency leaves something to be desired (see below) but what do
you want for a couple of dollars?
<p>
Interestingly, the boxes and safety labels state: &lt;1 mW,
&lt;3 mW, or &lt;5 mW without any correlation to the package description
of "Hi-Output Key Chain Laser".  And, they list "Class II Laser Product"
or "Class III Laser Product" apparently at random.  So much for safety
regulations. :)
<p>
Here is a rough breakdown of their condition:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Missing or damaged battery insulator: 3.
<li>Poor contact between end-cap and case: 3.
<li>Intermittent connections: 2.
<li>Weak or dead due to bad laser diode: 4.
<li>Poor fit, hard to assemble, but usable: 5.
<li>No problems found (cockpit error or bad batteries): 6.
</ul>
<p>
Note that a defective or damaged laser diode were no more likely than anything
else (and one of these would actually lase but only with 4 cells instead of 3).
All the others with actual problems could be repaired easily except
for those that were intermittent which would require extracting the guts from
the case.  The problem in the one sample I disassembled was bad contact
in the press-fit connection between the cast metal lens housing and copper
of the circuit board on which the bare laser diode chip was mounted.  
The beam focus on all the pointers was decent.  Power on all except
the weak or dead ones was probably between 1 and 3 mW (I didn't measure it).
About 2/3rds of the batteries were in new or close to new condition,
charge-wise.  A large precentage of the bad ones were bulging and a couple
had non-explosively disassembled themselves, likely due to a short circuit
as a result of the defective or missing battery insulators.
<p>
One nice characteristic of these pointers is that their output power can be
varied smoothly either by using a variable external power supply or by adding
a pot in series with the batteries or power supply.  Just make sure the
power source - be it a wall adapter or lab supply - is well behaved and
can't overshoot or be accidentally set much above the approximately 4.5 V of
fresh batteries.  At 4.5 V in, a 100 ohm pot will vary the output power from
below lasing threshold to maximum.  The beam was still decent below lasing
threshold (from LED emission) and would be acceptable for applications not
requiring the narrow line width and better coherence of a true laser.

<h3><A NAME="diodlm7">Can a Fried Laser Pointer or Diode Laser Module
 be Repaired?</A></h3>

Suppose someone offers you a diode laser module that has been damaged by
applying incorrect power (the smoke all leaked out) for $5.  Should you accept
it?  Is there any hope that the laser diode itself survived?
<p>
The quick answer is a definite maybe IFF the module or pointer can be opened
for examination or repair.  If it is a potted block, forget it.
<p>
The chances of success are much greater for a diode laser module since it is
likely to have a proper laser diode driver with current regulation and optical
feedback.  These are typically so over-designed that while applying excessive
voltage (well, within reason, not 120 VAC to a 5 VDC module!) or incorrect
polarity may blow some components, chances are that the laser diode itself
won't feel a thing and will survive unharmed.
<p>
Assuming you can get inside, repair should be possible.  And, even if you end
up having to replace a 5 mW laser diode (for, perhaps $10), you have made out
well.  High quality diode laser modules go for anywhere from $50 to $300.
<p>
However, depending on design, a laser pointer could be totally destroyed by
even modest overvoltage (say 5 V instead of 3 V from 2 AAA batteries) or
reverse polarity.  Some of these don't have anything more than a resistor
for current limiting.  So the laser diode could very well have been damaged
or turned into a DELD (Dark Emitting Laser Diode) or expensive LED.  All you
may end up with is a nice (or not so nice) case. :-(  Of course that in itself
may come in handy to package your own laser diode and driver - ignoring what
was originally there.  However, see the next section for more on this exciting
topic. :)

<h3><A NAME="diordlp">Repair of Diode Laser Pointers</A></h3>

The following applies to laser pointers containing just a battery, driver,
laser diode, and optics.  For now, this is only the red variety though
pointers using the Nichia violet laser diode, as useless and expensive
as they may be, would also qualify. :)  For green or other DPSS laser based
laser pointers, there is the additional complexity of the DPSS laser module
itself.  See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strrdl">Repair of DPSS Laser
Pointers</A>.  And, for older style helium-neon laser based laser
pointers, see the chapter: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtoc">HeNe Laser Testing,
Adjustment, Repair</A>.
<p>
With prices as low as $2.00, serious troubleshooting and repair of a cheap red
laser pointer probably isn't worth the effort, time, and expense.  But if you
have one with 58 pattern generating heads or just want the educational
experience, there may be a possibility of repair even though many of these
things are not designed with user serviceable parts inside.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="lsrptr1.gif">Typical Red Laser Pointer</A> for a general
idea of what to expect.  The detailed disassembly procedure will depend on
the exact model.  A combination of screw, press-fit, and glued construction
is likely.  Non-destructive disassembly may not be possible for some.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Focus adjustment:</b> Where there is no external focus adjustment, it
 may be possible to remove the front bezel and then access an internal focus
 ring.  With luck, it can be turned with a flat blade screwdriver or other
 suitable tool to tweak for best focus.  Take care not to scratch the soft
 plastic lens.  However, it may be necessary to remove a bit of glue locking
 it in place.  If the entire lens assembly is glued - no threaded barrel -
 adjustment may not be possible.
<p>
<li><b>Water damage:</b> If the pointer got seriously wet, <b>immediately</b>
 remove the batteries and get as much liquid out as possible.  If the liquid
 was just plain water, waiting long enough for it to completely dry (perhaps
 with modest assistance from a heat gun or blow dryer on the low setting)
 before replacing the batteries may be all it needs if nothing got on the
 inside of the optics.  However, if the liquid was something other than plain
 water, particularly a corrosive substance like salt water, complete
 disassembly and cleaning will be required.  Where the laser diode is in a
 hermetically sealed (usually 5.6 mm) package, quick action should permit the
 pointer to be salvaged.  However, with some newer really cheapo units using
 bare laser diodes, any contamination that reaches the laser diode chip may
 be bad news indeed.  In the latter case, very careful cleaning with pure
 alcohol or acetone may save it but this has to be done before attempting
 to power the diode - anything on the facet while powered may be terminal.
<p>
<li><b>Physical damage:</b> Where parts are actually broken, replacement may
 be the only option.  For the collimating lens, something from a CD player
 may actually be good enough.  However, suitable lenses can now be obtained
 from many laser and electronics distributors.
</ul>
<p>
Here are possible problem areas for a pointer that is weak or dead and
hasn't been run over by a Sherman Tank:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Battery:</b> Test under load or replace.  Confirm that the cells are
 correctly oriented.  For most laser pointers, the positive points <i>away</i>
 from the driver, opposite of a flashlight!  Check for dirty or corroded
 contacts and clean if necessary.
<p>
<li><b>Switch:</b> Using an ohmmeter, check for reliable operation of the
 push button switch.  Replacements may be obtained from a service parts
 supplier (they are often similar to those used on VCRs and other consumer
 electronic equipment).
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode driver:</b> Look for cracked solder connections,
 particularly at the switch and where the laser diode attaches to the
 driver board - these get abused.  If there is a power adjust pot, mark
 its exact location and then turn it back and forth a couple times to
 clean its track.  Test any diodes and transistors for shorts and opens.
 If there is an IC and it has a part number that can be identified, search out
 the datasheet.
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode:</b> See the sections starting with:
 <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct">Determining Characteristics and Testing of
 Laser Diodes</A> to determine if the laser diode is still good.  It may
 be possible to replace a bad laser diode but the operating current and
 monitor photodiode (if used) current specs would need to match fairly
 closely.  This could be an opportunity to improve the visibility by using
 a shorter wavelength laser diode like 650 nm instead of 670 nm.  However,
 avoid the temptation to increase the output power above the original 5 mW
 rating.  Not only are higher power diodes much more expensive and just as
 easily blown, 5 mW is the legal maximum (I had to say it).
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="diodlm8">Cleaning Diode Laser Module Optics</A></h3>

Note: There are additional considerations when cleaning the optical pickups
found in CD and LD players, CDROM drives, and other optical storage devices.
For more information, see the document:
<A HREF=""http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/cdfaq.htm">Notes on the
Troubleshooting and Repair of Compact Disc Players and CDROM Drives</A>.
<p>
There are at least 3 surfaces that can collect dirt - the two sides of the
lens (it is probably a single element) and the exterior of the laser diode
window.  However, in all likelihood, only the exposed surface of the lens will
need cleaning.
<p>
First, gently blow out any dust or dirt which may have collected inside the
lens assembly.  A photographic type of air bulb is fine but be extremely
careful using any kind of compressed air source.  Next, clean the lens itself.
It may be made of plastic, so don't use strong solvents.  There are special
cleaners, but isopropyl alcohol usually is all that is needed.  91% medicinal
should be fine, pure isopropyl is better.  Avoid rubbing alcohol especially if
it contains any additives.
<p>
Lens tissue is best, Q-tips (cotton swabs) will work.  They should be wet but
not dripping.  Be gentle - the plastic (probably) or glass and particularly
the anti-reflection coating on lens is soft.  Wipe in one direction only - do
not rub.  Also, do not dip the tissue or swab back into the bottle of alcohol
after cleaning the optics as this may contaminate it.
<p>
The alcohol should be all you need in most cases but some types of dirt (e.g.,
sugar) will respond better to just plain water.
<p>
The inside surface of the lens, any other optics, and the window of the laser
diode can be cleaned in a similar manner should this be necessary.  Usually,
it is not.
<p>
Do NOT use strong solvents (which may attack plastic lenses) or anything with
abrasives - you will destroy the optics surfaces.
<p>
CAUTION: Lenses or other optical components may be bonded or mounted using
adhesives that are soluble in alcohol or acetone (but probably not water).
Don't make the mistake I made and use too much solvent.  I still have not
found the tiny collimating lens that popped out of a laser diode module and
is now likely lost forever to the basement floor.  Crunch :-(.

<h3><A NAME="diodcsl">Damage to Camera Sensor from Laser Pointer?</A></h3>

Even a 1 mW laser beam can potentially produce permanent damage to the CCD
or silicon sensor array insid
e a video or still digital camera.
<p>
If the camera is focused at infinity, a collimated laser beam will be focused
to a tiny spot on the image sensor.  Whether damage will occur depends on
many factors including the type of image sensor, quality and focus of the
optics, and how long the beam is held in one place.  A 1 mW beam (much less
than what some laser pointers produce) is roughly equivalent to the brightness
of the noonday Sun at the equator on a clear day and when focused to a 10 um
spot (the approximate size of one pixel on a typical video camera) it becomes
10,000 times more intense!  Needless to say, pointing a camera at the Sun
is generally not recommended.

<h2>Anatomy of Fiber-Coupled Laser Diodes</h2>

Fiber-coupled laser diodes or diode lasers - same thing - aren't the sort
of thing you will find at your local K-Mart but
may turn up surplus from communications, medical, or other applications
requiring delivery of a high power laser beam over a fiber optic cable.
<p>
WARNING: Class IV laser products - the output from the fiber will destroy
vision and set things on fire!
<p>
CAUTION: When using fiber-coupled laser diodes (or any high power fiber-optic
system), the cleanliness of the fiber ends is critical.  Any speck of dirt
or contamination will be burnt to a crisp by the high optical power density.
In addition to the immediate power loss due to absorption and scatter, the
thermal effects may damage the fiber (requiring cleaving, remounting,
and repolishing).  And back-reflections can actually damage the laser diode
shortening its life or resulting in a permanent power loss and/or instability.
<p>
Fiber-coupled laser diodes are much easier to use than bare laser diodes even
though they still need an external high current driver.  (Of course, they are
also much more expensive.)  Aside from the physical protection provided by the
packaging, the output of the fiber is a nice circular beam with modest
divergence (about 16 degrees full angle) which doesn't require correction for
astigmatism or asymmetry.  Thus, simple lenses can be used for collimation and
focusing.  I've used a good sample of the 808 nm version of the first laser
described below to pump the guts from a green (DPSS) laser pointer just by
holding the end of the fiber next to the Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> crystal.  After
adding a coupling with a GRIN lens for focusing, I can get a few mW of green
light from it though I suspect the diameter of the pump beam is still larger
than optimal.  These will also easily pump the CASIX DPM0101 and DPM0102
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>/KTP composite crystals as well as other microchip lasers.
<p>
A typical unit is shown in <A HREF="ptfcld1.jpg">Typical Presstek Fiber
Coupled Laser Diode</A> along with a fiber focuser/collimator.  This model
was probably actually manufacturered by Opto Power
and will thus have similar internal construction to the one described below.
However, these and similar laser diodes from graphic arts platesettings and
similar equipment generally operate at between 820 and 880 nm which is NOT a
useful wavelength range for DPSS laser pumping.  So, just because it walks and
talks like a fiber-coupled laser diode does not mean it will of value other
than as a burning laser. :( :)  Typical characteristics of platesetter diodes
can be found in the section:
<p>
(Note that Opto Power is now part of Spectra-Physics but these lasers predate
the merger which may be one reason for the very different types of technology
used in the construction of the first three lasers, below).

<h3><A NAME="dioopfcdl1">Opto Power Corporation Fiber-Coupled Laser
 Diode</A></h3>

The first unit I dissected is typical of 0.5 to 1.5 W fiber-coupled diode
lasers.  Refer to <A HREF="fcld1.jpg">Typical 1 Watt Fiber-Coupled Diode Laser
Showing Interior Construction</A> and
<A HREF="fcldc1.jpg">Closeup of 1 W Fiber-Coupled Laser Diode Showing
Cylindrical Microlens and Fiber Tip</A> while reading the following
description.
<p>
WARNING: The output beam of high power laser diodes with an attached microlens
(or other collimating optics) is much better collimated than we are used to for
laser diodes - closer to that of a "real" laser.  The divergence (total at
the half power point) is typically 10x4 degrees as opposed to 10x40 degrees
for a bare laser diode.  What this means is that both the direct beam and
any specular reflections are MUCH more dangerous to vision even several
feet away from the source.  Even the reflection from a shiny IR detector
card can be dangerous.  This is especially scary for people who have become
complacent working with laser diodes being used to beams that spread out
to safe levels in a few inches.
<p>
The overall package is 1.5"(L) x 0.75"(W) x 0.5"(H) and is made of a block of
gold plated brass with a milled cavity.  There are red and black wires for
power and a single-mode fiber with SMA 905 connector for beam delivery.
<p>
After prying off the Epoxied lid, the following can be seen:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The laser diode is an open heatsink device similar or identical to the
 Spectra-Physics (now Newport) Prolite SCT open heatsink semiconductor
 laser.  (Go to <A HREF="http://www.newport.com/">Newport</A> and search
 for "Prolite SCT".  It includes reverse polarity
 protection in the form of a second laser diode chip wired in parallel with
 the primary laser diode.  (It may actually lase if driven with enough current
 but since it's mounted upside-down and there is only one bonding wire, it
 would probably fail at a relatively low drive current.  The beam also isn't
 anywhere useful.)  The heatsink is fastened to the case with a 2-56 cap
 screw.  In between is a metal thermal washer (probably indium, no silicone).
<p>
<li>Multiple gold bond wires connect the laser diode to a ceramic circuit
 board just for connections to the external power supply wires (there are
 no components on the circuit board).
<p>
<li>The fiber cable enters a hole on the side and is securely fastened with
 Epoxy.  At the point where it enters the interior of the package, the
 central fiber is entirely naked. :)
<p>
<li>The fiber end is located precisely in front of and nrealy against the
 output facet of the laser diode by a blob of Epoxy on a bit of ceramic midway
 between the wall of the package and the laser diode.  The length of the output
 facet and size of the fiber core are similar - order of 100 um.  Therefore,
 the fiber end must have been adjusted for maximum output coupling using an XYZ
 micropositioner (there is evidence of a little mark where it would have
 been attached).  Then the Epoxy would have been UV cured to lock the fiber in
 place.  Interestingly, the fiber isn't supported beyond the Epoxy - about 1 mm
 sticks out.  So, I imagine that tapping on the unit while operating would
 cause the laser output to be modulated at least somewhat.
<p>
<li>There is a cylindrical microlens glued to the edge of the laser diode
 heat sink to reduce the vertical divergence and gain more efficient coupling
 to the fiber.  It's hard to make out in the photo and not obvious even under
 a microscope but the optional use of such a microlens to reduce vertical
 divergence to about 6 degrees is mentioned in Opto-Power's description of
 their unpackaged laser diodes.
</ul>
<p>
A similar unit yielded the following test results:

</PRE>
<p>
Given the relatively high threshold, this diode is probably good for at least
1.25 W but I have only tested it to 1 W.

<h3><A NAME="dioopfcdl2">Opto Power Corporation High Power Fiber-Coupled Laser
 Diode</A></h3>

Here are a couple of other lasers that yielded to my set of hex wrenches - no
chisels or cutting torches required.  They were mostly dead prior to surgery
so no need to call out the SPCL (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Lasers!
<p>
These two are strange.  They have a rated output power of 3 W into a
multimode fiber.  Input voltage is the usual 2 V but the operating current
is supposed to be about 10 A (when new) with a recommended current limit
on the driver of 20 A!!!.  They only differ in wavelength.
<p>
Both had problems with low output power after relatively minimal use -
probably a few dozen hours at most.  Much of it could be restored by
readjustment of the internal alignment - which is surprising for a
packaged laser diode.  However, as you will see, these aren't ordinary
diode lasers!  But at least almost everything is adjustable, if I only
knew the proper procedure
<p>
The model number of the first one is OPC-D003-814-HB/100.  Its spec'd
wavelength is 814 nm special ordered to pump Nd:Mg:LiNbO<sub>3</sub>
(Neodymium doped magnesium doped lithium niobate, which incidentally lases
at 1,084 nm.)  However, when running at low power or with suitable cooling,
will operate at 808 nm.  The package is large - about 15 cm in length.  See
<A HREF="fcld3.jpg">Opto Power High Power Fiber-Coupled Laser Diode -
Overall View</A>.  A closeup of part of the interior is shown in
<A HREF="fcldc3.jpg">Partial Interior View of Opto Power High Power Fiber
Coupled Laser Diode</A>.  (Removing the rest of the case is possible but
more work than I could justify just to show the really boring output optics!)
The description below applies to both models:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The emitter is probably a small laser diode bar, about 5 mm in width.  The
 product blurb calls it a "diode laser array".
<p>
<li>The diode's output goes through a cylindrical microlens to collimate the
 vertical (fast) direction.
<p>
<li>Then it goes to a glass strip I can't really identify - it looks to be a
 wavy structure with about a 1 mm period.  The beam that exits this thing is
 about 5 mm  wide with a half dozen or more very distinct peaks in intensity
 (but only if the diode is actually lasing - when below threshold
 and just acting as an LED, the intensity profile is quite smooth).  On
 other high power diode lasers, a similar wavy thing is called an
 "integrator" or "homogenizer" and serves to make the beam profile
 more uniform.  Here it probably means that they don't attempt to line
 up each of the emitters with an entry point on the mirror (see below)
 but want the beam uniform.
<p>
<li>The beam then hits a thin glass plate with mirror coatings over very
 specific areas on both sides positioned at around a 45 degree angle in both
 X and Y which obviously can be very precisely adjusted and then clamped down.
 It appears as though the horizontal beam hits a tranparent area of
 the coating on the front surface and then sub-beams are channeled by multiple
 reflections and lined up vertically into a single beam before going to the
 subsequent optics.  This must be the magic Opto Power had been touting
 when they marketed these lasers. :)  In essense, it breaks up the diode's
 output into a series of spots that are single mode vertically and multimode
 horizontally, and stacks them vertically so the slow (multimode) axis is
 narrowed at the expense of the fast (single mode) axis.  The result would be
 similar to taking a series of smaller multimode diodes (e.g., 1 W, 100 um
 stripe) and arranging their emitting apertures in a vertical stack, but
 at lower cost.
<p>
 The original paper is probably
 "Two-mirror beam-shaping technique for high-power diode bars", W. A.
 Clarkson and D. C. Hanna, Optics Letters, vol. 21, no. 6, March 15, 1996.
<p>
<li>Then on to a short focal length cylindrical lens (oriented vertically)
 followed by a longer focal length cylindrical lens and a short focal length
 spherical lens to focus it into the fiber core.  This is conventional beam
 shaping.
<p>
<li>A monitor photodiode picks up scattered/reflected light for optional
 optical feedback control.
<p>
<li>A temperature sensor is included but no TEC.  In the original system, the
 fiber-coupled laser diode was mounted on a massive TEC which was on a massive
 forced-air cooled heatsink.  Given the maximum power dissipation, water
 cooling might be preferred.
</ul>
<p>
This particular unit originally had no output and might have been
dropped as the final focusing lens has slipped vertically in its
set-screw locked mount.  Fixing that was easy, but someone (I won't
name names!) had attempted to adjust the angular plate before realizing
the lens was out of position.  So far, I have been able to get
what would be around 2.24 W at 10 A (only tested to 4 A) into a
100 um core multimode fiber (which is what's called for in the spec)
though the diode inside should be capable of around 5.5 W
at 10 A (based on my measurements to 3 A).  This represents
about 40 percent of the output of the diode making it into the fiber.
With the original 100 um core fiber that came with the laser, the performance
is really dreadful - I suspect that particular fiber is damaged.  With a wide
(500 um) core fiber, most of the light available at the output of the focusing
lens does make it into the fiber.  This suggests that the problem may be not
so much in getting light to the output optics, but shaping the beam in such
a way that most of it can be coupled into the 100 um core fiber.  I have
carefully adjusted the fiber mount in X, Y, and Z, so that should be close
to optimal.  The magic angled plate may still be seriously misadjusted (but
I doubt it) or damaged, and the focusing lens may be a bit out of position
though I doubt that's the cause.  The diode may be weak - it did have
a run in with our "killer driver" - one that tended to zap laser diodes at
random due to overcurrent (though it's hard to comprehend how even that
unit could damage a diode perfectly happy with 20 A!).  The slope efficiency
is 0.68 which is somewhat low this type of diode but that could be due to
losses from the (non-AR coated) microlens and rippled plate.

<p>
The only values that were actually measured were the bare diode at 2 A and
to determine threshold, and the fiber outputs up to 3 A.  The others were
estimated.  That's why some of the numbers seem so perfect!  My LaserCheck
already had enough burnt spots in its plastic case. :)
<p>
Fine tuning the alignment (including those optics I haven't yet touched!)
might restore the missing power but I doubt that's really possible in finite
time while remaining sane without the original factory jigs and setup
procedure.  Or justifiable given that I currently don't have a good use
for this beast.  Devices like the much smaller, simpler, more efficient
Opto Power fiber-coupled laser diode described above are perfectly adequate
for an output power up to 1 or 2 W.  Of course, this one should still
produce full power at way below the recommended 20 A current limit so
perhaps I shouldn't be complaining very much.  A 3 W fiber-coupled laser
with a 100 um core fiber is rather impressive.  The original price was
also rather impressive - just under $6,000! :)
<p>
At least I was able to use the 100 um fiber to pump a CASIX DPM0102 green DPSS
composite crystal and get some green light!  However, at around 3 A and 35
pounds (including driver), this would have to be the biggest most inefficient
laser pointer on the face of the Earth! :)
<p>
The other unit has a model number of OPC-D003-980-HB/100.  Its wavelength
is 980 nm which is used to pump erbium doped materials that
lase in the area of 1550 nm (actually over a range of more than 50 nm).
Much of this diode's output makes it though the optics but less gets
into the fiber.  The threshold is much lower as well though the slope
efficiency isn't very good.  Realignment of the angled plate and fiber
connector was required on this one as well even to get to this point.
Originally, there was very nearly exactly 0.00 mW making it to the fiber
but no evidence of trauma:

<p>
As above, the only values that were actually measured were the bare diode
at 2 A and to determine threshold, and the fiber outputs at 2 A.  The others
were estimated.
<p>
My conclusions from examining and aligning these lasers is that while the
design is clever, it's way to finicky.  Both of these lasers had seen
relatively little use in a university lab environment.  While one had
probably been dropped knocking the focusing lens out of position, it may
have already been weak when that happened.  Possibly just repeated thermal
cycles resulted in various optics like the angled plate walking away
from proper alignment.  None of the adjustable internal optics had any
adhesive to lock their position, generally common in other lasers.
<p>
Both of these specimens probably date from the mid 1990s.
Nowadays (2008), companies offer micro-optics to do the same thing
with much higher efficiency that are both considerably smaller, are easier
to align, and are more robust.  One example is the
<A HREF="http://www.limo.de/fileadmin/PDF/BTS-HOC_150-500_1421.617.pdf">LIMO
Beam Transformation System (BTS-150/500D) and Hybrid Optical Chip (HOC)</A>
for coupling of laser diode bars with 19 emitters spaced 500 um apart, into
a multimode fiber, with an efficiency of 70 percent for a 200 um core
diameter.

<h3><A NAME="diospfcdl1">Spectra-Physics Fiber-Coupled Laser Diode</A></h3>

This is an 803 nm unit with a power output of around 1 W model unidentified.
It's application is also not known.  Correction optics consist of a short
focal length collimating lens glued to the rectangular diode "H" package to
collimate one axis, a cylindrical lens to correct the other axis, and an
adjustable (in X,Y,Z) focusing lens to get the light into the fiber core.
The distance from the focusing lens to the fiber tip (Z) is quite critical
but the position of the fiber in X and Y has a broad peak since the beam into
it is quite well collimated and smaller than the lens.

<h3><A NAME="diospfcdl2">Spectra-Physics High Power Fiber-Coupled Laser Diode
 Bar</A></h3>

Unlike the Opto Power unit above, this Spectra-Physics "FCBar" places
a special 19 core fiber end in close proximity to a 1.5 cm laser diode bar.

the laser diode terminals when no power is applied.  There is also a
personality EEPROM on the PCB.  There is a fiber microlens for fast-axis
collimation.  Since the fiber cores are relatively large (probably around 200
um), high efficiency coupling can be achieved as long as they are relatively
close and aligned with the emitting apertures.  Clamps and screws
allow the tip to be positioned precisely so each of the 19 cores aligns
with its mating aperture, close but not touching - about 0.1 mm
in the samples I've seen.
<p>
There is a temperature sensor but no TEC.  The module was designed to
mount on a "cold plate" fed directly by a hermetic recirculating chiller,
water chiller, or tap water.
<p>
At the other end of the armored cable, the 19 fibers terminate in an FC
connector with a large multimode core.  Why 19 fibers?  Probably because 19
cylinders pack nicely into a nice hexagonal array with a somewhat circular
perimeter.  The series is 1, 7, 19, 37, 61,....  Of course, other values
will work and for most applications it doesn't matter.  The lower power
version of these modules use a 7 core fiber.
<p>
The laser diode bar has a threshold current of about 6 A and should be capable
of at least 15 watts of output from the fiber.  It was part of a solid state
laser which was pumped by a pair of these FCBar modules.  The output power
of the solid state laser at 1,064 nm was probably around 10 W.  I plan to
test this diode further in the near future.  Another unit I am testing
has a threshold of 12 A, with a maximum rated output of 26 W.
Its output at 25 A is 10 W with 22 W at about 40 A.  Based on the
test data for a similar new diode, it's a bit weak - 26 W at 40 A is
typical.  But it would probably still meet rated specifications.
The model number is DMJ-ZLM-24-08.  It's called an FRU Diode Module.
<p>
A datasheet for the versions of these diodes in current production
(but without the electronics) would appear to be a version of the
Spectra-Physics (now Newport) Prolite SCT series.
(Go to <A HREF="http://www.newport.com/">Newport</A> and search
for "Prolite SCT".)  The exact models may not
be listed here as there may be versions with intermediate rated output power
(like the 26 W) not shown.  But, it should be possible to interpolate
power and current to get a reasonably accurate idea of the behavior.
<p>
And, placing a CASIX DPM0102 composite crystal next to the diode array
produces nice multiple (up to 3) parallel beams of green light. :)

<h4><A NAME="diospfcdr1">Repairing a Shorted FCBar Module - Sort Of</A></h4>

I've come across several fiber coupled laser diode array modules which
have a symptom of an almost dead short across the diode even with all
other components (relay, reverse protection diode) disconnected.  Upon
disassembly, there was a very obvious carbonized area on the face of the
diode as well as carbonized crud on the face of the fiber tip.  I have
preliminary results of repair attempts on two such modules.  There is no
way to get full power as one or more of the individual diodes has basically
blown up.  But some or most of the remaining ones may be salvageable.
<p>
I believe the cause of these failures is contamination or moisture getting
onto the front facet of the laser diode array.  The modules that have failed
in this way are not hermetically sealed due to the passage of the thermistor
temperature sensor leads through oversize holes in the PCB.  Three units
arrived in this shorted state.  One unit failed while I was attempting to
cool it on one of those ice packs used for keeping your lunch cool and I
expect there was condensation.
<p>
Of course, if you have the big $$$ available, replacing the laser diode
assembly itself is likely to be much more useful than the kludge below.
Then, it would be a "simple" matter of realigning the fiber cable.  But, the
diode will have to come with the fiber microlens for fast axis collimation
(added $$) and its individual emitting apertures must have the same spacing
(pitch) and similar size compared to the original.  In cases where that
was a custom OEM part, a suitable replacement may not be available.
<p>
The following is not something you should admit to in the presence of
your boss, if he/she has anything to do with laser diodes.  It's a long
shot but if the alternative is the trash, there is nothing to lose.
Here's the procedure.  No guarantees of anything!  Refer to
<A HREF="fcbar1-1.jpg">Spectra-Physics FCBar Fiber-Coupled Laser Diode
Bar - Overall View</A>.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Detach the fiber-optic cable assembly by removing the two screws holding
 it to the silver colored block of the FCBar module.  Once the cable is
 free, inspect the elongated "tip" for debris and damage.  On each of the
 four units I've seen, there was a very visible clump of carbonized debris
 covering the fiber tip opposite the diode(s) that shorted.  Lens tissue an
 alcohol easily removed it without a trace.  Once it has been cleaned, set
 the cable aside with protection for both ends.
<p>
<li>Detach the printed circuit board by removing the two Philips head
 screws connecting it electrically to the laser diode, the 4 hex head
 screws holding the PCB in place, and unsolder the two thermistor
 wires (not on all units).  Set the PCB assembly aside in a safe place.
<p>
<li>Remove the hex head cap screws attaching the diode terminals to the
 diode block and pull out the copper terminal assemblies.  Set them
 aside.
<p>
<li>Remove the remaining 3 hex head cap screws holding the diode block
 in place and set them aside.
<p>
<li>Carefully loosen the diode block from the heatsink compound or indium
 foil and remove it.
<p>
<li>Closely examine the output area of the diode.  Opposite where the crud
 was on the fiber tip, there will be a corresponding blackened/melted area
 behind the fiber microlens.  The lens itself may also be damaged.  Hopefully,
 the short circuit is localized to this area.
<p>
<li>The trick is to carefully scrape away the front facet of the bad diode
 with a knife or razor blade to clear the short.  What I suspect happens is
 that a bit of contamination or moisture on the front facet creates a
 conducting path.  Current builds up in the immediate vicinity quickly
 heating and destroying the diode.  The failed diode and at least one
 on either side will likely remain dead but hopefully, some, most, or
 all of the others can be salvaged.  If the failed diode is near the
 middle of the array, it may be possible to do the scraping without
 removing the fiber microlens.  However, if it's near one end, at
 least one end of the fiber microlens should be detached to provide
 enough compliance to get the knife or razor blade behind it.
<p>
 Work in small increments and use a current limited power supply to
 check the short.  At some point, the remaining shorting crud may
 be vaporized and the diode will suddenly spring to life.
<p>
<li>Once the short is removed, the module can be reassembled.  If the
 fiber microlens popped off or broke, you're on your own.  If only one
 end came loose, use a drop of Epoxy to reattach it but make sure excess
 doesn't interfere with the location of the fiber tip.
<p>
<li>Reinstall the diode assembly.  Center it and reattach the electrical
 terminals.
<p>
<li>Carefully check that the fiber tip of the fiber-optic cable assembly
 is about 0.1 mm from the fiber microlens when fully seated.  Above all,
 it must not touch as the fiber microlens will likely shatter in that case.
 See the next section for the fiber replacement procedure.
</ol>
<p>
I told you this was a long shot!  Comments welcome but nothing like: "There
is no way in h*** that this can work!". :)  I was able to recover 6 of 19
emitters on one module and 14 of 19 on another.  Whether they will survive
for any length of time is another matter.

<h4><A NAME="diospfcdr2">Replacment of a Damaged FCBar Fiberoptic
 Cable</A></h4>

Replacement of a damaged fiber is possible without fancy jigs.  Clean the
fiber tip to remove all traces of contamination.  Remove the
PCB or cover on the FCBar module so that the distance to the fiber tip
can be set precisely without bashing the fiber microlens.  Set it so
there is a just visible gap - about 0.1 mm.  Then, with
the two holding screws not quite tight, drive the diode at just above
threshold and adjust the X and Y position for maximum coupling, then
tighten the screws.  It shouldn't be possible to be off by an entire
emitter spacing and still get coupling.  An IR viewer or IR camera
is desirable to monitor scattered light inside the diode package and
minimize this as well. CAUTION: DO NOT drive the diode at more than
minimal power until the alignment has been optimized as excessive
back reflections can damage it instantly.  Note: The emitter spacing
(pitch) varies among models.  The units described above have a pitch
of about 0.78 mm.  Others may be 0.5 mm or 0.65 mm or something else.
Of course, the pitch must match exactly!

<h2>Low Power Visible and IR Laser Diodes</h2>
<h3><A NAME="diolpv0">Low Power Visible Laser Diodes</A></h3>

These are the typical 3 to 5 mW (maximum power) visible laser diodes probably
emitting at a wavelength in the 635 to 670 nm range.  They are found in all
modern red laser pointers, newer barcode scanners, laser light positioning
devices, and now in DVD (Digital Versatile/Video Disc) players and DVDROM
drives.
<p><ol>
<li>You can easily destroy the typical laser diode through instantaneous
 overcurrent, static discharge, probing them with a VOM, or just looking
 at them the wrong way. :-)
<p>
<li>By far the easiest way to experiment with these devices is to obtain
 complete laser diode modules.  Versions are available with both the drive
 circuitry and (adjustable) collimating optics.  They are more expensive
 than raw laser diodes but are also virtually foolproof.  Inexpensive laser
 pointers are one source for similar devices which may be adequate for your
 needs but modifying them could be more of a challenge.  See the chapter:
 <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A> for suppliers of
 both raw laser diodes and laser diode modules.
<p>
<li>Any time you are working with laser light you need to be careful with
 respect to exposure of a beam to your eyes. This is particularly true
 if you collimate the beam as this will result in the lens of your eye
 bringing it to a sharp focus with possible instantaneous retinal damage.
</ol>
<p>
Typical currents are in the 30-100 mA range at 1.7 to 2.5 V. However, the power
curve is extremely non-linear. There is a lasing threshold below which there
will be no coherent output (though there may be LED type emission). For a
diode rated at a typical current of 85 mA, the threshold current may be 75 mA.
That 10 mA range is all you have to play with.  Go to 86 mA (in this example)
and your laser diode may be history in much less than the blink of an eye.
<p>
This is one reason why most applications of laser diodes include optical
sensing to regulate beam power.  The third lead on the laser diode package is
connected to an internal optical sensing photodiode used to regulate power
output when used in a feedback circuit which controls your current.  This is
very important to achieve any sort of stable long term operation.
<p>
You can easily destroy a laser diode by exceeding the safe current even for
an instant. It is critical to the life of the laser diode that under no
circumstances do you exceed the safe current limit even for a microsecond!
<p>
In addition, as the temperature of the laser diode changes (heats while
powered), the current requirement to produce a given optical output increases
as well.  Without optical feedback if you set the current to be correct once
the temperature of the laser diode stabilizes, it will likely blow out
instantly the next you turn it on from a cold start!
<p>
Laser diodes are also extremely static sensitive, so take appropriate
precautions when handling and soldering.  Also, do not try to test them with
an analog VOM which could on the low ohms scale supply too much current.
<p>
It is possible to drive laser diodes with a DC supply and resistor, but unless
you know the precise value needed or have a laser power meter at your disposal,
you can easily exceed the ratings before you realize it.
<p>
You might hear someone bragging "I have driven thousands of laser diodes by
just connecting them to a battery and resistor and never have blown any".
Sure, right.  While it is quite possible that the susceptibility to instant
damage due to overcurrent varies with the type of laser diode, unless you know
the precise behavior, you must err on the side of caution.  Some designers
have gone to extremes, however.  See the section: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsre2">Laser Diode Power Supply 2 (RE-LD2)</A>
for a design with 5 levels of protection!
<p>
For testing, see the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct1">Testing of Low Power Laser Diodes</A>.
<p>
For an actual application, you should use the optical feedback to regulate
beam power. You should also use a heat sink if you do not already have the
laser diode mounted on one.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpstoc">Laser Diode Power Supplies</A>.
<p>
The raw beam from a laser diode is generally wedge shaped - 10 x 30 degrees is
a typical divergence. You will need a short focal length convex lens to produce
anything approaching a collimated beam.  The optics from a dead CD player (even
though CD players and CDROM drives use infra-red laser diodes, the optics
can likely still be used with visible laser diodes), a low to medium power
microscope objective, or even an old disc camera can provide a lens that may
be entirely suitable for your needs.

<h3><A NAME="diolpv1">CD player and Other Low Power IR Laser Diodes</A></h3>

The major difference between these and the visible laser diodes discussed
in the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diolpv">Low Power Visible Laser Diodes</A> is that the output is
near-IR - usually at 780 nm (wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm are generally
considered the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum).  Therefore,
the emission is not readily visible and you must use an IR detector device to
even confirm that the laser is operating properly.  This also means that
safety is even more of a consideration with these devices since what you
cannot see CAN hurt you (or at least your vision).
<p>
Thus, these devices make truly lousy laser pointers or laser light shows as
the emission is just barely visible in subdued light.  If you hoped for a Star
Wars type laser beam, better go hunting for a 25 W argon laser. :-)
<p>
However, for data or voice communications, various kinds of scanning or
sensing, and electro-optic applications where visibility is not needed or not
desirable, such low cost sources of coherent light are ideal.
<p>
Similar types are found in CDROM drives and newer LD (LaserDisc) players.
CD-R recorders, Minidisc equipment, magneto-optical, and other writable
optical drives including WORM drives, use devices that are similar in
appearance and drive requirements but may be capable of somewhat higher
maximum power output - as much as 30 mW or more.
<p>
Modern laser printers use laser diodes producing anywhere from 5 mW to 50 mW
and beyond depending on their resolution and speed (pages per minute).  High
resolution laser imagers, typesetters, and plotters, may use laser diodes
producing 150 mW or more.  (However, equipment built before 1985 or so may use
helium-neon or even argon lasers rather than diode lasers.)
<p>
The laser diode in a laser printer is located inside the scanner unit which is
probably a black plastic case about 6 or 8 inches on a side and a couple of
inches thick with a motor protruding from the bottom.  The laser diode is
mounted (along with its driver board, collimating optics, and even possibly a
Peltier solid state cooler on some) either near one corner or inside.  There
should be a laser safety sticker on it as well - but these fall off sometimes! 
<p>
It is essential that additional precautions are taken if you have a higher
power laser diode from equipment of this sort (or don't really know where
yours spent its earlier life).
<p>
There are now laser diodes (or possibly laser diode arrays) with optical
output measured in 10s, even 100s of watts though these will not be what you
would call tiny and will probably require buss bars for electrical power and
plumbing for cooling!

<h3><A NAME="diolpv1a">Example of Laser Printer Diode Laser Module</A></h3>

(Portions from: <A HREF="http://www.eio.com/">EIO</A> (ecsc@eio.com) and
 Chris Leubner).
<p>
This <A HREF="lpldm.gif">Laser Printer Diode Laser Module</A> is from an
older unidentified laser printer, laser scanner/duplicator, or similar device.
It shows an example of a typical assembly consisting of an IR laser diode,
collimating optics, and electronics driver board.
<ul>
<li>Pinouts for the interface cable are as follows: (1) No Connection, (2)
 Laser On, 25 mA +5V, (3) Gnd, (4) -12 VDC, (5), Laser OK +5 VDC (output), (6)
 +5 VDC (Laser Power Supply), (7) Gnd, (8) Modulation Input, (9) No Connection,
 (10) Laser Power Adjust.
<p>
<li>VR3 on the electronics board controls photo diode feedback voltage (idle
 laser power).
<p>
<li>VR2 on the electronics board controls the maximum current allowed to reach
 the laser diode.  Important - the laser must be operated in pulse mode with
 VR2 in present position.
</ul>

Laser diode and optics characteristics:

<ul>
<li>Type: Sharp LT020MD (index guided).
<li>Wavelength: 780 nm.
<li>Maximum power: 20 mW with TE cooling, 5 to 7 mW typical without (as in this unit).
<li>Lasing threshold: 60 to 70 mA typical.
<li>Electrical configuration: Case is common negative.
<p>
<li>Collimation optics: Mini-optic rail with a C/CX or 3 element collimator,
  and an f theta lens.  These optics (except the 3 element type) work with
  laser diodes up to 150 mW and 635 nm wavelength.  The 3 element type works
  with 670 to 1300 nm laser diodes as well.
</ul>
Note that this is only the front-end.  It does not include the beam scanner
(motor driven multifaceted mirror), field correction and directing optics, or
beam position sensor - which would be present in a complete laser printer.
The output of this module is a collimated IR laser beam.  The actual focal
point will be at the image plane (photosensitive drum surface) after passing
through the other optics.

<h3><A NAME="diolpv1b">CD Player/CDROM Drive Laser Diode
 Characteristics</A></h3>  

Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion assumes the type of laser
diode found in a CD player or CDROM drive.  These are the most common devices
you are likely to encounter.  In fact, I bet you have at least one broken
CD player or CDROM drive sitting in your junk box - or maybe you just retired
your 16X CDROM drive because it was soooo slow and obsolete. :-)
<p>
CD player laser diodes are infrared (IR) emitters, usually 780 nm, with a
maximum power output of around 5 mW.  Their emission will appear very slightly
visible and deep red.  This is the eye's response to the near-IR radiation but
appearing about 10,000 times weaker than the actual beam would be it it's
wavelength were centered in the visible part of the spectrum.  Despite what
the EM spectrum charts show, the eye's response does not drop off to zero at
exactly 700 nm - there is decreasing sensitivity which may extend out beyond
820 nm depending on the individual (though some people can't even see the 780
nm).  Just realize that the main beam is IR and almost totally invisible.
Take care.  A collimated 5 mW beam is potentially hazardous to your eyes.
Don't be misled into thinking the laser is weak due to the dim appearance
of the beam.  It is not supposed to be visible at all!
<p>
If you don't want to take even the minimal risk of looking into the lens at
all, project the beam onto a piece of paper held close to the lens.  In a
dark room, it should be possible to detect a red spot on the paper when the
laser is powered.  For any laser more powerful than this or where the beam
may be even approximately collimated, viewing the spot on a diffuse surface
is the only safe method for checking the beam.
<p>
Typical CD laser optics put out about 0.3 to 1 mW at the objective lens though
the diodes themselves may be capable of up to 4 or 5 mW depending on type.
If you saved the optical components, these may be useful in generating a
collimated or focused beam.  The aspheric objective lens will be optimized
for producing a diffraction limited spot about 1 to 3 mm from its front
surface when the optical system is used intact.
<p>
The optics may include a collimating lens, diffraction grating (to produce the
three beams in a three beam pickup), beamsplitter prism or mirror, turning
mirror (for horizontally mounted optics), and focusing (objective) lens.
Older pickups tend to have larger and more complex sets of optics.  Despite
the fact that they are mass produced at low cost, these are all very high
quality optical assemblies.
<p>
However, depending on design, some of the parts may be missing or combined
into one component.  For example, many Sony pickups do not appear to use a
collimating lens.  For pickups with a collimating lens, if the objective
lens is removed, you should get a more or less parallel main beam and two
weaker side beams.  Many newer designs have a combined laser diode/photodiode
array rather than individual components.  Mix and match parts for your needs
(if you can get it apart non-destructively).  Where there is no collimating
lens, the objective lens may be used for this purpose if positioned closer
to the laser diode.
<p>
For examples of typical optical pickup/optical block designs, see:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="kss361a.gif">Sony KSS361A Optical Pickup</A> (typical of many poplular Sony/Aiwa types)
<li><A HREF="kss110c.gif">Sony KSS110C Optical Pickup</A> (from Sony D14 portable CD player)
<li><A HREF="k38n.gif">Sanyo K38N Optical Pickup</A> (from Teac CD-516S 16X CDROM Drive)

<li><A HREF="crp.gif">Optical Pickup from Philips CR-206 CDROM</A> (very simple and compact)
</ul>
WARNING: A collimated 5 mW beam is hazardous especially since it is mostly
invisible.  By the time you realize you have a problem it will be too late.
<p>
The coils around the pickup are used for servo control of focus and tracking
by positioning the objective lens to within less than a um (1/25,400 of an
inch) of optimal based on the return beam reflected from the CD.  See the
document: <A HREF=""http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/cdfaq.htm">Notes on the
Troubleshooting and Repair of Compact Disc Players and CDROM Drives</A> for
more information on optical pickup organization and operation.
<p>
Typical drive currents are in the 30 to 100 mA range at 1.7 to 2.5 V. However,
the power curve is quite non-linear (though perhaps not as extreme as the
typical visible laser diode).  There is a lasing threshold below which there
will be no coherent output (just IR LED emission).  For a diode rated at a
nominal current of 50 mA (typical for Sony pickups, for example), the threshold
current may be 30 mA. This is one reason why most applications of laser diodes
include optical sensing (there is a built in photodiode in the same case as
the laser emitter) to regulate beam power.  You can easily destroy a laser
diode by exceeding the safe current even for an instant. It is critical to the
life of the laser diode that under no circumstances do you exceed the safe
current limit even for a microsecond!
<p>
Laser diodes are also supposed to be extremely static sensitive, so use
appropriate precautions. Also, do not try to test them with an analog VOM
which in particular could on the low ohms scale supply too much current.
<p>
It is possible to drive laser diodes with a DC supply and resistor, but unless
you know the precise value needed, you can easily exceed the ratings.
<p>
For testing, see the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct1">Testing of Low Power Laser Diodes</A>.
<p>
For an actual application, you should use the optical feedback to regulate
beam power. You should also use a heat sink if you do not already have the
laser diode mounted on one. CD laser diodes are designed for continuous
operation.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpstoc">Laser Diode
Power Supplies</A>.

<h3><A NAME="dioholld">Hologram Laser Diodes</A></h3>

Some manufacturers of CD and DVD optical pickups have gone to a combined laser
diode/photodiode (LD/PD) array package which looks like a large LD but with 8
to 10 pins.  Aside from the objective lens assembly, the only other part may
be the turning mirror, and even this is really not needed.  Such a pickup can
be very light in weight (which is good for fast-access drives) and extremely
compact.
<p>
Eliminating the components needed to separate the outgoing and return beams
should result in substantial improvement in optical performance.  The only
disadvantage would be that the beams are no longer perfectly perpendicular
to the disc 'pits' surface and this may result in a very slight, probably
negligible reduction in detected signal quality - more than made up for by
the increased signal level.
<p>
Some of these use what are known as "hologram lasers" (a designation perhaps
coined by <A HREF="http://www.sharpsma.com/">Sharp Corporation</A>).  With
these, the functions previously performed by multiple optical components.
can be done by a "Holographic Optical Element" or HOE.  The HOE can simply
be a diffraction grating replacement or can be designed to perform some more
complex beam forming.  A variety of hologram lasers (as well as conventional
laser diodes and photodiode arrays) used to be listed at the Sharp Web
site.  I do not know if they are still manufactured.
The typical Sharp hologram laser (versions for CD, DVD,
and other types of optical storage devices) eliminate the normal diffraction
grating in the three-beam pickup as well as the polarizing beamsplitter and
associated components making for a very simple, compact, low cost unit.

<h2>Определение характеристик и тестирование лазерных диодов</h2>

Последующие разделы относятся к большинству диодов с торцевым излучением,
в том числе к синим/фиолетовым диодам "Nichia". Однако, большинство
конкретных описаний и правил, если не указано иное,
написано для лазерных диодов красного и ближнего ИК-излучения, поскольку
они более распространены. Синие/фиолетовые лазерные диоды имеют более
высокое рабочее <i>напряжение</i> (от 4 до 6 вольт) и более чувствительны
к <i>любым</i> повреждениям.

<h3><A NAME="diowwld">Работа с лазерными диодами</A></h3>

Хотя лазерные диоды и светодиоды имеют много общего, лазерные диоды гораздо
более чувствительны ко ВСЕМУ и моментально погибают от малейшей провокации
вроде кратковременной перегрузки током или маленького статического разряда,
который не повредил бы другим электронным компонентам.
<p>
Чтобы уменьшить риск повреждения ваших драгоценных лазерных диодов (ЛД)
во время сборки, переделки или извлечения из приборов, прочитайте нижеследующее
руководство. Часть его относится только к лазерам, имеющим оптическую обратную
связь, а часть - ко всем типам.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Держите лазерный диод в заводской антистатической упаковке вплоть до
 момента установки в устройство.
<p>
 Если лазерный диод вытащен из техники, воткните его выводы в антистатическую
 (черную) губку, как только они освободятся, и храните в антистатических
 пакетах или коробках.
<p>
<li>Держите выводы лазерного диода закороченными вместе с помощью кусочка тонкой
 проволоки или другим способом перед установкой, во время пайки и до момента,
 пока драйвер не будет полностью подключен.
<p>
 Для вытаскивания ЛД из техники добавьте закорачивающий провод перед выпаиванием
 или удалением из печатной платы, если это возможно.
<p>
<li>Если лазерный диод нужно подключать с помощью разъема (то есть он не подключен
 к схеме навечно), добавьте параллельно ему комбинацию из маленького конденсатора,
 резистора и диода для защиты от обратной полярности. Типичные значения:
 1 нФ || 1 кОм || 1N4148 для диода малой мощности; 0,01 мкФ || 100 Ом || 1N4148
 для 1-ваттного диода накачки. (Диод 1N4148 можно заменить на отечественный КД521
 или КД522 - <i>прим. перев.</i>) Это понизит шансы уничтожить диод статикой или
 глупыми ошибками.
<p>
<li>Примите адекватные меры защиты от статики, включая использование заземляющего
 браслета. Не работайте в шерстяном свитере, натирая ногами старинный шерстяной ковер!
<p>
<li>Во время пайки ограничьте нагрев лазерного диода, паяйте как можно быстрее. Облудите
 провода или печатные дорожки, к которым будет подключен ЛД. Выводы ЛД обычно покрыты
 золотом и паяются очень легко и быстро. Теплоотвод на выводах ЛД также может помочь.
<p>
 Используйте правильно заземленный паяльник с регулятором температуры и тонким жалом.
 100-ваттный паяльный пистолет "Weller" - это <b>не</b> тот инструмент, которым
 можно собирать или переделывать тонкие печатные платы!
<p>
<li>Когда лазер установлен, обеспечьте соответствующий теплоотвод или термоэлектрическое
 охлаждение с правильным закреплением лазерного диода, чтобы гарантировать, что
 температура лазера никогда не поднимется выше 35-40 &deg;C (за исключением тех
 случаев, когда это нужно для подстройки частоты). Более высокие температуры
 уменьшают срок службы.
<p>
<li>Используйте только драйвер, который гарантирует отсутствие перенапряжений или
 иголок обратной полярности. Прочитайте все остальные требования к электропитанию
 лазерных диодов. Даже если к диоду прилагаются полные результаты тестовых прогонов,
 считайте, что ваши климатические условия отличаются в достаточной мере, чтобы
 повлиять на ключевые параметры вроде чувствительности мониторного фотодиода
 - начинайте с малых мощностей и постепенно повышайте до рабочей мощности,
 используя подходящую технику измерений. Убедитесь, что ограничитель тока
 установлен на безопасное для диода значение - оптическая обратная связь
 может сбиться.
<p>
<li>Дважды проверьте подключения выводов и разъемов. У голых лазерых диодов
 (особенно у мощных) радиатор почти всегда АНОД (положительный), а верхний
 вывод - КАТОД (отрицательный). (Я видел всего лишь пару исключений, и эти
 диоды были какими-то особыми с пометкой "R&amp;D" (то есть "исследовательский
 прототип" - <i>прим. перев.</i>). Это в точности наоборот по сравнению с тем,
 что ожидает любой инженер, и я сжег больше одного лазерного диода из-за
 недостатка внимания! У лазерных диодов в корпусе стандарта нет!
 Слово "оно похоже" относится только к лошадиным подковам и ручным
 гранатам - для лазерного диода оно часто означает полное разрушение! :)
<p>
<li>У голых лазерных диодов избегайте попадания чего-либо на выходной торец.
 Даже одна пылинка может привести к мгновенному и окончательному повреждению
 диода. Как только система полностью сделана, она должна быть загерметизирована,
 желательно с сухим азотом, чтобы избежать загрязнений. У мощных лазерных
 диодов в корпусе любая грязь на выходном окне скорее всего сгорит в пепел,
 который может испортить окно.
<p>
<li>Избегайте непреднамеренных отражений выходного излучения диода обратно в диод.
 Такие отражения могут провзаимодействовать с лазерной генерацией так, что
 у лазерных диодов с оптической регулировкой станет чрезмерным.
</ul>
<p>
И еще раз, дважды проверьте все подключения и схемы, прежде чем подавать питание
после установки или переделки. Особенно проверьте отсутствие замыканий припоем
и повреждений на печатной плате. Убедитесь, что вы прочитали цоколевку правильно!
Прочитайте разделы про испытания, чтобы уменьшить шансы сжечь лазерный диод
при включении.

<h3><A NAME="diodct0">Опеределение характеристик лазерных диодов, извлеченных из техники</A></h3>

Оптические головки CD-плееров, лазерных принтеров и другого списанного и устаревшего
оборудования являются сказочным источником дешевых лазерных диодов.
Было бы прекрасно, если бы что-то было известно про их характеристики!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Измерьте напряжения, токи, осциллограммы сигналов и т.д., прежде чем разбирать прибор!
  Однако это может быть невозможным, если техника была получена в неработающем состоянии.
  К тому же, такие измерения на самой сборке лазерного диода могут быть рискованными.
  Остается надеяться, что там есть контрольные точки хотя бы для тока лазерного диода.
<p>
<li>Схемы и/или руководства по ремонту прибора. Они могут содержать достаточно информации
  для использования имеющейся схемы или для ее замены. Однако схемы имеются редко,
  хотя бы по финансовым соображениям. Если даже он есть, нужных мелочей в них может не быть.
  К тому же сама схема находится внутри модуля, который можеть быть частью какой-то общей
  системы управления, могущей быть непригодной для какого-либо отдельного применения.
<p>
<li>Сделайте обратную инженерию схемы. Отследите соединения деталей на имеющейся плате, определите,
  что зачем сделано, и потом повторите схему или используйте имеющуюся, как требуется. Это
  должно позволить определить рабочий ток лазерного диода и/или чувствительность фотодиода.
  При наличии некоторого оборудования в некотрой технике это несложно, потому что схема
  драйвера относительно проста. А в некоторой - почти невозможно.
<p>
<li>Просто идентифицируйте лазерный диод. Извлеките диод из сборки (с соответствующими предосторожностями
  против статического электричества) и надейтесь, что на нем есть читаемая маркировка.
  Потом идите на сайт <A HREF="http://www.k3pgp.org/ldspecs.htm">"K3PGP's Laser Diode Specifications"</A>,
  принадлежащий K3PGP (Email: k3pgp@qsl.net), или откройте справочник по
  оптоэлектронным устройствам, чтобы найти параметры диода. Многие крупные
  производители лазерных диодов имеют веб-сайты с обширной информацией и поисковые системы
  по ним. Эта информация несколько устарела, но может быть полезной для опознания
  горсти старых пыльных лазерных диодов, найденных в куче компоста. :)
<p>
  Предупреждение: Извлечение лазерных диодов из оптической сборки может повлиять на
  юстировку важной оптики, поскольку невозможно будет установить ее обратно в точности
  в том же положении. Это скорее всего неважно для большинства задач, но имейте это в виду,
  если вы хотиет использовать прибор в целях, похожих на его исходное назначение.
  Смотрите раздел 
  <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diousc0">"Reasons to Leave the CD Laser Diode in the
  Optical Block"</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Если ни один из этих способов не годится, используйте приемы, описанные в разделе
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct1">"Тестирование маломощных лазерных диодов"</A>,
имея в виду возможный риск.

<h3><A NAME="diodct3a">Испытание лазерных диодов лабораторным источником питания</A></h3>

Нижесказанное подтверждает некоторые аргументы, приведенные ранее, относительно
использованя обычных блоков питания для проверки лазерных диодов.
Предполагается, что у вас есть доступ к блоку питания с плавной регулировкой
напряжения. Такой блок питания не обязательно должен быть хитрым и дорогим,
но он должен быть нечувствительным к скачкам напряжения сети, а регулировка
напряжения должна работать гладко - потенциометр не должен быть "трескучим",
или лекарство может быть опаснее болезни!
Некоторые варианты простого источника регулируемого напряжения и тока, описанные
в разделе <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpssglt1">"Sam's Laser Diode Test Supply 1"</A>,
также могут подойти.
<p>
(Частично из присланного: Bob.)
<p>
На самом деле вы МОЖЕТЕ использовать любой старый лабораторный источник питания для
ваших диодов, если хотите. :) Это просто очень неудобно. Если вы используете
лабораторный блок питания, убедитесь, что вы отрегулировали напряжение так, что
через диод не пойдет ни слишком большое напряжение, ни слишком большой ток,
убедитесь, что вы поставили быстровосстанавливающийся выпрямительный диод между анодом
и катодом лазерного диода для защиты от переполюсовки напряжения, и, самое
главное, ВСЕГДА работайте в следующей последовательности:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Включите ваш блок питания и установите на 0 при ОТКЛЮЧЕННОМ лазерном диоде.
<li>Подклюите ваш лазерный диод.
<li>Проделайте желаемые тесты.
<li>Установите блок питания обратно на нулевое напряжение.
<li>Отключите лазерный диод от вашего источника.
<li>Теперь выключите блок.
</ul>
<p>
Если вы оставите лазерный диод подключенным, пока включаете и выключаете блок
питания, и блок питания не рассчитан на управление лазерными диодами, переходные
процессы быстро выведут лазер из строя. Я делал испытания надежности некоторых моих
лазерных диодов и получал от них более 1000 часов работы. Для тестов я использовал
простые старые лабораторные блоки питания, и деградация диодов все еще соответствовала
в точности графикам, указанным производителям.

<h3><A NAME="diodct1">Тестирование маломощных лазерных диодов</A></h3>

Если у вас есть цоколевки и спецификации вашего лазерного диода, эти процедуры
можно сильно упростить. Если вы как мимимум можете определить марку и производителя
(посмотрите на корпус, если возможно), зайдите на их сайт, найдите справочник по оптоэлектронике
или смотрите 
<A HREF="http://www.k3pgp.org/ldspecs.htm">"K3PGP's
Laser Diode Specifications"</A> автора K3PGP (Email: k3pgp@qsl.net).
<p>
Обратите внимание, что если у вас есть устройство из  CD-плеера, CDROM или другого
оптического привода с 8 или 10 выводами, это комбинация лазерного диода и фотодиодной
матрицы в одном корпусе. Вам в первую очередь надо будет определить три вывода самого
лазерного диода. Определить это обычно возможно по отслеживанию проводов - могут быть
даже пометки на печатной плате. Во многих случаях лазерный диод управляется отдельными
радиодеталями, а все остальное подключено к микросхеме предусилителя. Как только
цоколевка лазерного диода определена, работать с ним можно точно так же, как с обычным
3-выводным устройством.

<h4><A NAME="diodct2">Определение цоколевки лазерного диода</A></h4>

Далее предполагаем, что вы не знаете ничего про устройство, кроме того, что это
лазерный диод от 3 до 5 мВт видимого или ближнего ИК диапазона. (Существуют
модели с 4 выводами и полностью отдельными выводами от лазерного диода
и фотодиода, но они мало распространены
Далее предполагаем, что вы не знаете ничего про устройство, кроме того, что это
лазерный диод от 3 до 5 мВт видимого или ближнего ИК диапазона. (Существуют
модели с 4 выводами и полностью отдельными выводами от лазерного диода
и фотодиода, но они мало распространены.)
<p>
Первый шаг - определить, какая пара выводов соответствует лазерному диоду и фотодиоду.
Ваш лазерный диод может иметь одну из следующих конфигураций:
<p>
<PRE>

            ЛД                 ЛД                 ЛД                 ЛД

</PRE>
<p>
Судя по всему, самая распространенная схема - (2). Вывод "Общ"("COM") при этом подключается к
положительному полюсу источника питания (+V) по отношению к катоду лазерного диода (КЛД, LDC)
и аноду фотодиода (АФД, PDA). Однако, большинство (или все) синие/фиолетовые лазерных
диодов фирмы Nichia сделаны по схеме (4).
<p>
<ul>
<li>Фотодиод (ФД, PD) имеет обратное смещение. Его анод (АФД) питает нагрузочный резистор и
 усилитель датчика оптической обратной связи для регулятора тока.
<p>
<li>Лазерный диод (ЛД, LD) имеет прямое смещение. Его катод (КЛД) подключается к транзистору
 драйвера и/или цепи для регулировки тока ЛД в зависимости от тока фотодиода и, возможно,
 к цепи модуляции.
</ul>
<p>
Если вы оставляете фотодиод установленным в оптической сборке, смотрите таже раздел
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diousc0">"Reasons to Leave the CD Laser Diode in the Optical Block"</A>
- примеры подключений.
<p>
Когда вы можете увидеть и выводы, и внутренности лазерного диода, легко определить, какой
вывод куда идет:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Общий вывод (Общ, C или COM) соединяется с корпусом или с платформой, на которой держатся
 лазерный диод и фотодиод. Вероятно, этот вывод не будет виден внутри корпуса.      
<p>
<li>Подключение к лазерному диоду (ЛД) будет сделано тонким проводком к кристаллу лазера, который
 находится вблизи передней части (оптического окна) корпуса.
<p>
<li>Подключение к фотодиоду (ФД) будет сделано тонким проводом к кристаллу фотодиода, который 
 расположен (вохможно, под некотрым углом) глубоко внутри корпуса.
</ul>
<p>
Если вы можете определить эти 3 соединения глазами, экспериментально остается определить только
полярность ЛД и ФД.
<p>
The following assumes you did not have this luxury:
<p>
The photodiode's forward voltage drop will be in the approximately 0.7 V range
compared to 1.7 to 2.5 V for a red visible or near-IR laser diode, up to
6 V for a Nichi blue/violet LD. So, for the test below if you
get a forward voltage drop of under a volt, you are on the photodiode leads.
If your voltage goes above 3 V, you have the polarity backwards.
<p>
CAUTION: Some laser diodes have very low reverse voltage ratings (e.g., 2 V)
and will be destroyed by modest reverse voltage at a few microamps of current.
Check your spec sheet.  However, the laser diodes found in CD players seem to
be happy with 4 or 5 volts applied in reverse.  Of course, a shorted or open
reading could indicate a defective laser diode or photodiode.
<p>
If the laser diode is still connected to its circuitry (probably a printed flex
cable), it is likely that the laser diode will have a small capacitor directly
across its terminals and the optical sensing photodiode will be connected to a
resistor or potentiometer.  In particular, this is true of Sony pickups and
may help to identify the correct hookup.
<p>
And finally, determining pinout without applying power to the laser diode
package is possible by taking advantage of the sensitivity of the
laser diode (LD) and photodiode (PD) to external light.  However, once the
tests below have been performed, it's probably a good idea to confirm with an
ohmmeter or some other technique.
<p>
A light source with a wavelength shorter than that of the laser diode
must be used, so this could be problematic for violet laser diodes,
but for red or IR LDs, a green laser pointer or flashlight works well.
<p>
But it must be taken with a grain of GaAsP :) as I've seen some strange
behavior on some laser diodes.
In particular, in testing a high power laser diode - 20 W, 19 emitters,
shining a green laser pointer or flashlight on the output facet produced the
expected result - up to a few hundred mV with the positive on the anode
of the diode (the + input).  However, shining the same light source in
from the *side* sometimes produced a *negative* voltage of 100 mV or more!
What's the explanation for that?
<p>
It did work as expected with a 9 mm can package.
Of course, this does assume that the pins are known to be for
the laser diode and not a monitor photodiode or TEC!! :)
<p>
(From: Nikos Aravantinos (aravantinos@ath.forthnet.gr).)
<p>
After having played with several CD and CD/RW diodes, I believe that it is
possible to determine the pinout to a high degree of confidence without
applying any significant power to the laser diode.
<p>
All that is needed is a voltmeter (rather a millivoltmeter) and an operating
incandescent lamp (tungsten filament like a pocket flashlight). If you direct a
light beam to the device under test and measure the voltage between common and
each of the other two pins you will find two of the four following
possibilities:
<p>
<ul>
<li>About +500 mV. This is a PD anode.
<li>About -500 mV. This is a PD cathode.
<li>About +5 mV. This is a LD anode.
<li>About -5 mV. This is a LD cathode.
</ul>
<p>
The large difference is due to the fact that the photodiode is a much more
efficient converter of light to electricity although both the PD and LD work
as photo cells. The above figures depend on the intensity of the light but
there will be no mistake: The PD voltage will always be much larger that the
LD voltage.

<h4><A NAME="diodct3">Powering Up the Laser Diode</A></h4>

Either of the circuits below can be used to identify the proper connections and
polarity and then to drive the laser diode for testing purposes.
<p>
<ul>
<li>One approach that works for testing is to use a 0 to 10 VDC supply with a
 current limiting resistor in series with the diode:
<p>
<PRE>
             R1 100 ohms 1 W
       + o--------/\/\--------+-----------+--------+
                              |           |        |

                              |           |        |
       - o--------------------+-----------+--------+
</PRE>
<p>
 If your power supply has a current limiter, set it at 20 or 25 mA to start.
 You can always increase it later.  If a suitable bench power supply isn't
 available, one which can be built for a few dollars and has the needed bells
 and whistles is described in the section:
 <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpssglt1">Sam's Laser Diode Test Supply 1</A>.
<p>
<li>Alternatively, a fixed supply with a potentiometer can be used:
<p>
<PRE>
                             R2 100 1W
       + o-----------+     +----/\/\------+-----------+--------+
                     |     |              |           |        |
       10VDC         / ^   |         C1 +_|_      C2 _|_     __|__ LD1
    Power supply     \&lt;----+ R1     10uF ---   .01uF ---     _\_/_ Laser diode
   (No overshoot!)   / 100 ohms         - |           |        |
                     | 2W                 |           |        |
       - o-----------+--------------------+-----------+--------+
</PRE>
<p>
 R2 limits the maximum current.  If you know the specs for your diode, this
 is a good idea (and to protect your power supply as well).  You can always
 reduce its value if your laser diode requires more than about 85 mA (with
 R2 = 100 ohms).
</ul>
<p>
The two capacitors provide some filtering to reduce the risk of a transient
blowing the laser diode.  C2 should be mounted close to the laser diode.
The part about 'no overshoot' is very important.  If the supply isn't well
behaved, it will fry laser diodes.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct3a">Testing of Laser Diodes Using a Lab Power
Supply</A> for additional comments.
<p>
Before attempting to obtain lasing action with either of these circuits,
monitor the voltage across what you think is the laser diode as you slowly
increase the power supply or potentiometer.
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you guessed correctly (or have the pinout diagram from the spec sheet
 or determined from its former life), the voltage will increase until around
 1.5 to 2 V and then climb more slowly.  Don't push your luck unless you are
 also monitoring the laser diode current and optical output.
<p>
<li>If you are across the laser diode or photodiode in the reverse biased
 direction, the voltage will continue to climb above 2 V without slowing.
 Don't push your luck here - the breakdown voltage of the laser diode may
 be only a little more than this and - you guessed it - exceeding this is
 not healthy for the laser diode either.
<p>
<li>If you are on the photodiode in the forward direction, the voltage will get
 stuck around .7 V.
</ul>
<p>
Once you have identified the correct connections, very carefully monitor the
current through the laser diode as you slowly increase the current and check
for a laser beam:
<p>
<ul>
<li>For IR laser diodes, you *must* use an IR detector circuit, card, video
 camera or camcorder (with the requisite 3 hands) to monitor for an actual
 IR laser beam.  See the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct4">Methods of
 Sensing IR</A> for a variety of options.
<p>
<li>For visible laser diodes, you can use your eyeballs or any more
 sophisticated detector as desired.  Look from an oblique angle or better yet,
 place a white card a couple of inches in front of the laser diode.  Even a
 1 mW laser diode is an intense source of light - there will be no doubt when
 lasing begins.
</ul>
<p>
Some typical operating currents for laser diodes of various wavelengths are
listed below.  THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES.  Your laser diode may have a lower
operating current than the ones listed here!  The lasing threshold may be as
little as 5 or 10 mA below the operating current and the operating current may
be 5 mA or less below the maximum current.
<p>
<PRE>
    Wavelength        Operating Current
  ---------------------------------------
      808 nm             60 - 70 mA
      780 nm             45 - 55 mA
      670 nm             30 - 35 mA
      660 nm             55 - 65 mA
      650 nm             65 - 85 mA
      640 nm             70 - 90 mA
      400 nm             30 - 50 mA
</PRE>
<p>
However, some laser diodes may have an operating current as low as 20 mA and
VCSELs tend to be much lower (but you probably don't have any of those
to play with yet!).
<p>
Of course, if you inherited a bag of identical laser diodes and can afford to
blow one: (1) I could use a few before you do this :-) and (2) you probably
could fairly accurately characterize them by testing one to destruction.
<p>
For a current below the lasing threshold for your laser diode, there will be
some emission due to simple LED action.  As you slowly increase the current,
at some point (if the laser diode is good) as you exceed the threshold current,
the character of the emission will change dramatically and a very slight
increase in laser diode current will result in a significant increase in
intensity.  Congratulations!  The laser diode is lasing.
<p>
CAUTION: unless you have a laser power meter, don't push your luck.  The
maximum safe current may be as little as 5% above the lasing threshold.  Go
over by 6% and your diode may be history.  The exponential power curve seems
to be steeper with visible laser diodes but there is no way to be sure without
specifications.  It is all too easy to convert laser diodes into extremely
useless DELDs (Dark Emitting Laser Diodes) or very expensive LEDs.
<p>
I have used this approach with laser diodes from dead CD players without
difficulty.  In the case of many of these, the operating current is printed
on a sticker on the optical block, often as a 3 digit number representing
the current in 10ths of mAs.  Typical values are 35 to 60 mA (350 to 600).
Sony pickups typically average around 50 mA.  Without this information, the
best you can do is to estimate when it is lasing at the proper intensity by
comparing the brightness of the 'red dot' one sees by looking into the lens
from a safe distance at an oblique angle.  However, this is not very reliable
as the optical power at the objective lens depends on the particular CD player.
<p>
Even if you have complete test data for you diode, it's still a good idea to
start low and monitor output power.  The diode was originally tested under very
precise conditions which probably aren't quite the same as you have (e.g.,
temperature) so laser diode or monitor photodiode current could be different
by enough to cause problems.

<h4><A NAME="dioldtl">Limited Destructive Testing of Low Power Laser Diodes</A></h4>

Attempting any of the following may result in total destruction of your laser
diode, but if you are willing to risk its health, there may be a way of
determining something about where damage will occur and possibly have it
survive more or less intact.
<p>
If the failure mechanism for your particular laser diode is NOT Catastrophic
Optic Damage (COD) to the facets but something else like  thermal damage,
then it may be possible to identify the onset without
serious harm by looking for a fall off in slope efficiency.  For some types
of laser diodes, the rate of increase of output power with respect to
drive current will decrease well before there is a noticeable - or any -
permanent loss of performance or that magic transformation to a
Dark Emitting Laser Diode (DELD) or expensive LED. :)
But there is no way to know if COD is the limiting failure mode for
any particular laser diode without testing it, possibly to destruction.
If the limiting damage mechanism is COD, there may be no indications of
distress before the creation of a DELD.
<p>
This testing is best done with the diode on a good heatsink or TEC.  Increase
current in small increments while monitoring output power.  After the onset
of lasing, the output power should increase quite linearly with current.
But near the limit, this slope may decrease.  Stop there!
A well behaved curve tracer (no overshoot or glitches, etc.) can also be
used since then the onset of non-linearity will be very obvious on the
graphical display as the peak current is increased.  But note that a high
speed curve tracer may actually side step the thermal issues until COD occurs
and it is too late, because the short time it spends at the highest current
doesn't allow for a significant temperature increase in the laser diode.
<p>
Even though the output power is still increasing after the slope changes,
don't go there beyond there!  You'll be treading on dangerous ground.  Of
course, it's possible that some latent damage has already occurred by the
time any noticeable non-linearity is seen so no guarantees if trying such
a stunt.
<p>
All reasonably civil comments are welcome. ;-)
<p>
(From: Lostgallifreyan.)
<p>
I've learned to detect the onset of critical overdrive by eye. :) I'm not 
sure it always works, especially on the higher power single mode diodes, 
but it works with the old gain guided Philips OF4944's and the newer 
Hitachi/Opnext 35 and 50 mW 658 nm index guided MQW diodes.
<p>
When you look at the projected spot on a dark surface, the appearance of 
the light goes from strongly specular to a less specular output as you 
approach destructive drive levels. I haven't got the kind of tools needed 
to quantify what is happening but I think the line broadens, or more likely 
becomes noisily erratic the way audio filters with feedback become sine 
wave generators, moving up from noise to clear sine like a laser does at 
threshold, and then producing a keen abrasive sounding edge if you apply 
too much gain. I'm thinking this is maybe a good analogy, and that the 
effect of too much input is visible as increased noise.
<p>
Note that the critical limit is VERY close above that visible noise 
threshold. I've often saved a diode for long term running at WAY over 
recommended max current, by detecting this by eye, then backing off until 
the light is strongly specular again. I've found one weakness to this 
though, it is best to use on lower powered diodes, max 50 mW, and the 
better ones at that. If you use the cheapest for a given power, you'll find 
inconsistencies, especially regarding risk of instant DELD after strong 
retro-reflection. This is no big deal though, the high power single mode 
diodes will always die from that even under correct operating conditions. 
Cheap diodes might be broader in linewidth anyway, so it might be harder to 
see the critical increase in noise.

<h4><A NAME="diomldc">Measuring Laser Diode Current in Equipment</A></h4>

This applies mostly to high power laser diodes such as those used for solid
state laser pumping.  However, measuring the current of a 5 mW laser pointer
diode can sometimes come in handy. :)
<p>
Usually, there will be a current test point in the power supply with a
specified calibration in terms of volts/amp of diode current.  Of course the
circuit could be defective resulting in incorrect readings.
<p>
So, ultimately, it will come down to putting a current meter in series with
the LD unless you have a clamp-on <i>DC</i> ammeter (which isn't common).  As
long as it is a decent instrument with adequately sized short leads (e.g., no
significant voltage drop) AND you make all connections securely with power
off and using proper anti-ESD practices, there should be minimal risk to the
diode.  Just remember that most high power laser diodes have their positive
terminal bonded to the heatsink and this is generally grounded so the meter
must be isolated.
<p>
If there is a series resistor already present, measuring the voltage drop
across it and computing current as V/R is quite acceptable.  Again, make
all connections in a secure manner with power off.  Double check that your
meter is set to a voltage range <b>NOT CURRENT</b> as that would result in
a low shunt resistance across the existing resistor and if that is used for
current sensing, would <i>increase</i> the current through the laser diode -
possibly to destructive levels.
<p>
Adding a series resistor so measurements can be made in this manner is also
possible though more risky.  It must be a low enough value so as not to affect
the behavior of the driver circuit.  Some drivers may be affected by the
actual diode voltage even if it only varies by a few dozen mV.  A true
constant current driver won't care.

<h4><A NAME="diodact">Art's Comments on the Testing of Unidentified Laser
 Diodes</A></h4>

(From: Art Allen, KY1K (aballen@colby.edu).)
<p>
Sorting by noticeable differences is almost useless - later model 40 milliwatt
diodes come in the 5 mm package now.  You can't tell much by looking at the
packages!
<p>
My experience has been that lasing threshold current can vary by a factor of 2
(with temperature and this is verified by the Sharp catalog). Threshold
current is NOT any sort of reliable indicator - that's why the drive
electronics senses actual optical power output!
<p>
That's NOT to say that knowing the threshold isn't useful.
<p>
Here's my take on it:
<p>
I think that once the threshold has been reached, you can push the diode to
about 10 percent past that current safely. For bigger diodes, you probably
have 20 percent + of cushion.
<p>
Let's say I have a diode that snaps to laser mode at 50 mA. I'd drive it to
55 mA and measure the output quickly. I would set my APC to maintain that
power level output and go on to the next diode.
<p>
For larger diodes, it's common to not even use a feedback photodiode for
power sensing. Thats because these diodes have MUCH wider margins between
the threshold and the smoke valve release ratings. Let's say I find a 2
lead LD that starts lasing at 400 mA. This diode can probably be pushed an
additional 20 to 25 percent and driven with a constant current source.
<p>
With no name/unspecified diodes, in my opinion I'd stick with making them lase
and holding them at that power output rather than squeezing every last
milliwatt from them.
<p>
I might loose a few in testing, but I surely would not loose many.
<p>
Use a large area PD mounted right on the face of the LD under test. You can
use a bias supply and a series resistor. Put your voltmeter across the
resistor. As you slowly ramp up the LD current, you will see all hell break
loose when observing the power output meter. Above threshold, the LD is
fairly efficient and fairly linear (power out versus current above threshold).
<p>
As a ball park figure, you can assume that the threshold current is about 10
to 15 percent of maximum power out for the diode although it varies a lot
for bigger and for IR diodes. So, trying to operate a LD to maintain 5
percent of it rated output is damn close to impossible because of the
nature of the beast.
<p>
Again, all figures and numbers quoted widely variable.  Don't take them
too seriously.
<p>
PS: Make sure your LD testing supply is smooth (ramp up) and test it with
an LED first!

<h4><A NAME="diodct3b">Characteristics of Some Typical Low Power Visible Laser
 Diodes</A></h4>

The following is just a microscopic sample of data for some unidentified
visible (red) laser diodes from my (anti-static) junk box.
<p>
Having analyzed the circuit in the section:
<A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsre4">Laser Diode Power Supply 4 (RE-LD4)</A>, I
then proceeded to try out a variety of typical visible laser diodes.  For
all the undamaged laser diodes that I tested, leaving SBT open resulted in
safe feedback regulated operation at Vcc1 = Vcc2 = 7 V.  But, depending on
the particular sample's photodiode sensitivity, optical output power varied
widely.
<p>
While testing, I used a regulated power supply with adjustable current limit.
The voltage was set at 7 V and the current limit knob was used to ramp up the
input to the driver while monitoring laser diode current and/or feedback
voltage from the photodiode.  This approach may have prevented damage to a
laser diode on more than one occasion.

</PRE>
The numbers in () do not mean anything - they were found marked on each sample
and are only used to identify them uniquely.
<p>
Laser output power was estimated to seven significant digits based on the
perceived brightness using my Mark-I eyeballs (with AutoCal(tm) option). :-)
<p>
The resistance of SBT (R7) is listed.  However, the actual photodiode load
is R7||R6 (33.2K) and thus the photodiode current is (Vcc1/2) = 3.5/(R7||R6)
when optical feedback is successful in maintaining regulation.  Since the
photodiode current should be proportional to optical power, you will probably
find that my high mileage eyeballs suffer from some slight non-linearity as
well. ;-)
<p>
I do not have specifications for any of these laser diodes.  However, they
are typical of the 660 to 670 nm types capable of 3 to 5 mW maximum output
power found in readily available diode laser modules and laser pointers.
<p>
Samples 1 through 6 were all in a large (9 mm diameter) package while samples
7 through 9 were in a small (6 mm diameter) package.  As you will note, for
these types of laser diodes, power output does not really correlate with
package size.  Each was mounted along with a collimating lens (adjustable in
some cases) in an aluminum block or cylinder (variety of styles) which also
acts as a heat sink.
<p>
I suspect that samples 2 and 3 were of similar construction but that this
differed from that of samples 1 and 4.   Note how sensitive sample 1 is to
slight increases in current - dramatic evidence of the risks involved in
running these without optical feedback.  Samples 7 through 9 also appeared to
be similar but I only had one fully operational unit of this type to test so
no detailed comparison could be made.
<p>
I do not know whether the higher current for sample 2 is due to prior damage
or just a normal variation in laser diode power sensitivity.
<p>
Samples 4, 8, and 9 (*) had been damaged to varying degrees previously due to
running with excessive current.  These disasters occurred prior to analyzing
the behavior of this laser driver circuit.  Sample 9 was absolutely positively
beyond a shadow of a doubt totally dead laser-wise behaving like a poor excuse
for a visible LED in a cool-looking fancy package. :-)
<p>
In the case of samples 5 and 6, I continued to decrease SBT until a distinct
jump in laser diode current was required to maintain the voltage across SBT
(and thus beam power).  For example, with sample 5, the jump from 74 mA to 89
mA may have indicated that losses were building and damage or total failure
would have resulted if pushed any further.  However, at that point, no changes
in laser diode behavior had occurred and all lower power levels ran at the
same drive current as before.  Note: I do not know if this is a valid approach
for checking the limits of a laser diode but it may work for some types.
<p>
All of the other (undamaged) laser diodes tested could probably have been
pushed to higher output power but without knowing their precise specifications
and only using my Mark-I eyeballs for a laser power meter, I chickened out.
However, there was definitely headroom above the power levels listed above.

<h4><A NAME="diotvio">Testing of Violet Laser Diodes</A></h4>

I was asked to test a bunch of Nichia NLHV500B/C 5 mW violet laser diodes,
with wavelengths between 398 and 410 nm.
Fortunately, I was able to use a high quality laser diode controller - the
ILX Lightwave LDC-3900 with a 500 mA driver module.  This has enough voltage
compliance range for the 4 to 5 V across the diode at its operating current.
In most respects, aside from the peculiar color, these diodes behave more or
less just like any others.  However, there are a few items to note:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The appearance of the output (to me at least) was more of a white-ish blue
 than the deep violet I expected.  Certainly a lot of this was fluorescence
 of the white paper used as a screen but almost anywhere the beam fell, it
 had this appearance.  Apparently, nearly everything fluoresces at these
 short wavelengths.
<p>
<li>About 10 percent of the output power when measured with my LaserCheck
 laser power meter was actually in LED emission.  So, a reading of 5.5 mW
 on the LaserCheck was really only 5 mW of laser output and 0.5 mW of LED
 output.  However, the monitor photodiode was accurate, agreeing with the
 data printed on the box.
<p>
<li>The beam pattern looks pretty much like that of any other typical laser
 diode - spread out in the fast-axis, relatively narrow in the slow-axis.
 But it appears to have numerous striations which I don't believe are
 due to damage or dirt since they are very fine - almost like speckle but only
 in the fast-axis direction - and are similar on all the diodes that
 actually lased.  There is also a lot of off axis scatter that I've heard
 is normal for Nichia diodes.
<p>
<li>A heatsink is essential for stable operation.  Since the heat dissipation
 is relatively low (200 mW typical), a TEC isn't needed for testing where
 stability isn't important but without even a heatsink, power would drop
 off very quickly and even lasing became erratic.
</ul>
<p>
Someone who didn't have a clue about testing laser diodes had gotten to
these before me but apparently wasn't able to destroy them all.  That
in itself was amazing. :)
<p>
Out of 9 samples:
<ul>
<li>Three worked with threshold, operating, and monitor current close to the
 values printed on the box.
<p>
<li>One worked with very reasonable currents but obviously wasn't the
 device originally in the box since the monitor current wasn't correct.
<p>
<li>One had a somewhat high threshold and operating current but still
 achieved a stable 5 mW of output.  It may still be in spec but not
 actually be the device from the box that it was in.  (The diode package
 is only marked with a laser enscribed nearly microscopic 2-D barcode
 which can't be deciphered without a scanner.  And even on units where
 I'm sure the diode is in the proper box, there appears to be no obvious
 correlation between the barcode on the diode and the barcode on the box
 label!)
<p>
<li>Two were almost totally dead with no LED emission until near 100 mA.
 Even this was erratic.  The electrical characteristics of these showed
 a high leakage current so the operarting voltage of 4 or 5 V or more
 needed for efficient LED emission or violet lasing wasn't reached.
<p>
<li>Two worked as LEDs but didn't lase even at 100 mA.  Taking one of these
 to 150 mA resulted in it joining the ranks of the dead ones, above.
</ul>
<p>
While I haven't actually looked at the longitudinal mode structure of
coherence length, here is some info:
<p>
(From: "Lynn Strickland" (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
We're coupling Nichia diodes to single mode fibers.  Our key program
engineer says that lasing on multiple modes and mode hopping is a big
problem with Nichia diodes.  They are not single mode and tend to jump as
much as 1 nm away in wavelength without warning.  He doesn't think Nichia
diodes will ever work in an application requiring single frequency light
unless someone makes a breakthrough.

<h3><A NAME="diottld">Testing of Telecom Laser Diodes</A></h3>

These typically come in a 14 pin package similar to a DIP IC with leads
sticking out the sides.  They are supposed to be mounted in something called
not surprisingly, a "laser diode mount" for testing, but of course you
don't have one of those.
<p>
An example of this type of unit is the CQF938 from
<A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A>.  This exact model
number is no longer listed on the JDSU Web site but may be found
at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/CQF938.pdf">Uniphase CQF938
High Power 1,550 nm CW DFB Lasers with PM Fiber</A>.  It includes a DFB laser
diode with photodiode power monitor coupled into a polarization-maintaining
fiber, bias T LD drive network, and Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC)
and temperature sensor thermistor.
<p>
If a laser diode mount is not being used, the package will have to be
clamped to a good heatsink.  Based on the pinouts found on the datasheet,
the TEC controller will drive pins 6 and 7 for the TEC+ and TEC-,
respectively.  The sensor is pins 1 and 2 with the controller set for
a 10K ohm thermistor.
<p>
The DC drive to the laser diode is on pins 11,13 and 3 for its anode
and cathode, respectively.  The modulation is AC coupled in via pin 12.
If optical feedback for output power regulation is to be used,
the monitor photodiode is on pins 4 and 5.
<p>
And, despite it being in a fancy, and very expensive package,
extreme care must be taken in handling and drive as the
laser diode is still sensitive to EVERYTHING!!!

<h3><A NAME="diopcdhb">Testing of CD, DVD, HD-DVD, and Blu-ray Burner Laser Diodes</A></h3>

The laser diodes in CD, DVD, HD-DVD, and Blu-ray burners typically do not
have an internal monitor photodiode.  So, for most hobbyists, this means
the only practical way of powering them is with a constant current supply.
At least, that's what can be done for testing.  Once installed in a
permanent setup, an external monitor photodiode can be added to implement
constant output power operation, but that's for the advanced course. :)
<p>
These laser diodes are operated at two different power levels - low power
(less than 5 mW) for reading and high power (30 mW and up) for burning.
I assume that there is some external monitoring of the power to regulate
this in the DVD burner, but it's not inside the laser diode.
<p>
If the specs are known, then using a heavily filtered well behaved
(no spikes, overvoltage, or reverse polarity when power cycling or due
to line transients!) adjustable voltage power supply and series current
limiting resistor is probably easiest.
<p>
The laser diode should be mounted in a heatsink.  Leaving it in the original
mounting of the burner is acceptable as is clamping the can between a pair
of aluminum plates, one with a hole drilled through it.
<p>
For the IR and red LDs from CD and DVD burners, respectively, the polarity
can be determined in the usual way if a spec sheet isn't available - by
increasing the voltage *very* slowly (with the current limiting resistor)
up to 1.5 to 2 V but NO MORE.  The LD will
start conducting by then if the polarity is correct.  For HD-DVD and Blu-ray
LDs, it's really best to check specs since the maximum reverse voltage may
be lower than the minimum forward voltage where conduction begins.
<p>
Once the polarity is known, slowly increase the voltage while monitoring
current and  output power As usual, the LD will behave as an LED up to its
lasing threshold with a somewhat diffuse glow, and then the rate of change
of output power will dramatically increase above threshold, with a narrowing
of the beam pattern.
<p>
Some of these LDs are good for 100 to 200 mW or more of single spatial
mode output - especially high-X DVD burner LDs.  But without the specs,
there is no way to know when they will start turning into DELDs (Dark
Emitting Laser Diodes).
<p>
Once the operating point is known, a power supply can be built either using
the same approach of a constant voltage through a series current limiting
resistor, or with an IC regulator like an LM317 in constant current mode.
However, I prefer the former as it's more difficult for misbehavior to
zap the laser diode since the maximum current will be limited by passive
components rather than the IC, doing who-knows-what when power cycled.
<p>
Checking with other people who have already played with these LDs is a good
idea.  One place to ask is on the USENET newsgroup alt.lasers.  Another
would be the various holography forums.  They may already have
discovered the limits of your specific model of burner LD (possibly
the hard way).

<h3><A NAME="diothpl">Testing of High Power Laser Diodes</A></h3>

The following applies to the sorts of laser diodes that are used to pump
solid state lasers and provide large amounts of heat or light in a small
area for medical or materials processing applications.  They are not what's
found in a laser pointer!
<p>
WARNING: With multiple <b>WATTs</b> of output power, particularly for high
power IR laser diodes, both eye safety and even possible heat/fire damage to
materials must be taken seriously.  <b>NEVER</b> look directly toward the
output end of the laser diode unless there is no chance of any power being
applied to it (even from residual capacitor charge).  Direct the output in
such a way that it isn't possible to for any eyeballs to intercept the beam
or specular reflections.  If the beam isn't focused, the heat/fire damage risk
is minimal but something to take into consideration.  Near-IR laser diode
output may look weak and whimpy but realize that the actual intensity is
10s of thousands of times stronger than it appears!.  Although the output of
a bare laser diode diverges greatly, if fitted with any sort of collimating
optics, the mostly invisible beam remains dangerous for a distance of many
feet.  Become complacent around these and your vision is at serious risk.
<p>
However, to maintain one's respect for these things, it would be nice to
pop in an equivalent power visible source.  Of course, for a truly high power
laser diode array - say a 60 W 808 nm bar - this is basically impossible
though if you think of all the light being emitted from a 1,000 W light bulb
but with a source size of 1 cm or so, it won't be far off.  But an
appreciation could be gotten even for a 0.5 W source by substituting a 0.5 W
visible laser diode (if you can afford one!) and realizing how darn bright
and concentrated it really is!
<p>
Also, even an output power as low as 10 mW is enough to affect dark materials
when focused with even a simple lens.  The beam from a 30 mW laser diode will
easily melt black electrical tape and put tiny holes in paper and wood
surfaces.

<h4><A NAME="dioichp">Identifying Connections On High Power Packaged Laser
 Diodes</A></h4>

These may be in a TO3 or other transistor-like case or a standard or
non-standard laser diode package which may also include a TE cooler (TEC)
and temperature sensor.  The laser output may be via a window, collimating
or focusing lens, or fiber.  But the assumption is that there are no
electronics inside for the laser diode itself beyond possibly a bypass
capacitor and/or resistor, and reverse protection diode.
<p>
As with ALL laser diodes, locating a datasheet with pinout is truly the
best solution.  Where there is a manufacturer's part number, a Web search
may be successful.  Even if the exact model isn't found, the package may
be sufficiently standard that a close match will be sufficient.
<p>
If there are only two terminals or wires, then all that needs to be determined
is which one is the anode and which one is the cathode of the laser diode.
In most cases, the anode (+) will be connected to the metal case.  This
can be tested with a DMM on the low ohms range (not an analog VOM which
may produce too much voltage/current and damage the laser diode).
<p>
For those with more than 2 connections, there is likely an internal TE
Cooler (TEC) and associated temperature sensor so expect 3 pairs of wires or
terminals.  Some may be twisted pairs or coax but that really doesn't help
much.  Even which are paired may not be obvious so checking of all possible
combinations may be necessary.
<p>
Measure between pairs, again using a DMM only:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The temperature sensor is usually an NTC thermistor with a resistance of
 between 5K and 15K ohms at 25 &deg;C.  Most common is around 10K ohms.
<p>
<li>The TEC will measure a few ohms and will read differently depending on
 which probe is on which terminal since it generates a few mV if its two sides
 are at different temperatures as they would be from handling.  With some
 DMMs, readings may not even make sense due to the generated voltage.  Or,
 measure its voltage on the DMM's mV range.  Nothing else in the package
 will produce a voltage output of any consequence.
<p>
 The polarity of the TEC can be determined by monitoring the sensor with
 a multimeter while passing a small current through the TEC (100 mA should
 be more than enough to detect a change).  With the polarity correct for
 cooling, the resistance of the NTC thermistor will increase.  When heating,
 it will decrease.  Try both polarities checking for an opposite change in
 the sensor resistance to confirm that the TEC is what's actually being
 driven.
<p>
<li>The laser diode may or may not have its anode connected to the case since
 the TEC will be physically between the diode and the case.  In some cases,
 the LD can be identified using the diode check function of your DMM but ONLY
 if its open circuit output voltage is less than 2 V!! and only if any reverse
 protection diode, if present, is silicon, not another laser diode chip
 (probably without mirror coatings) as are used by some manufacturers.  It
 should read either 0.7 V or open in the reverse direction (0.7 being if
 there is a silicon reverse protection diode, open if there is none).  It
 should read about 1 to 1.4 V in the forward direction if there is no parallel
 resistor.  If there is, it may take a few dozen mA before the voltage
 flattens out in the forward direction.  However, your mileage  may vary
 and knowing the pinout is really best. :)

For fiber-coupled types, there is a loss coupling into the fiber which may
be as high as 50 percent.  Even for diodes with microlenses, GRIN lenses,
or normal glass lenses, there is some loss from the the wings of the highly
divergent raw diode beam not making it through the optics.

<h4><A NAME="diothpl0">Determining Partial High Power LD Specifications
 Non-Destructively</A></h4>

In many ways testing of 0.5 W and higher laser diodes is easier than low
power types.  The main reason is that while overcurrent spikes can still
destroy or damage the laser diode instantly, the difference between the
threshold current and max current is much greater for high power laser
diodes.  However, they are definitely susceptible to instant death from
reverse voltage above a few volts and all other handling, ESD, and driving
precautions still apply.  A bit of static may not result in instant destruction
but can easily cause a microscopic defect which will only grow with time.
Keep the laser diodes in antistatic (black foam) material when not in use
with their connections shorted together.  Make it a habit to touch an earth
ground before touching the laser diode.
<p>
The same general testing approach can be followed as with low power devices.
If no high quality adjustable laser diode driver is available, I would suggest
a very simple rectified transformer with very large filter capacitor bank to
minimize ripple.  Control this from a Variac.  Use a current limiting power
resistor of several ohms between the caps and the diode.  Depending on the
size of the laser diode, anywhere between 1 and 10 A may be required.  Put
a modest load across its output to discharge the filter caps quickly after
power off.  For up to 2 A, I've used a 16 VAC, 5 A power transformer, bridge
rectifier, about 20,000 uF filter capacitor, an 8 ohm, 50 W power resistor,
and a 100 ohm, 5 W load.  The reason I suggest using such a simple power
supply is that it is inherently free of overshoot on power cycling (which
can't be said in general for active regulators unless specifically addressed
in the design).
<p>
Note that these high power laser diodes usually don't have monitor photodiodes
for optical feedback - output is determined via current and temperature
control.  For the purposes of testing, if you have a TEC (Thermo-Electric
Cooler), set it for around 20 &deg;C.  If you don't have a TEC, mount
the laser diode package on a large heat sink (with forced air cooling if
necessary) to minimize temperature rise.  As long as the laser diode package
itself remains cool or just warm to the touch, it will be fine.
<p>
CAUTION: Change connections - including any meters - only with power
<b>OFF</b> and the filter caps of the power supply fully discharged.
Even the charge on a 1 uF, 5 V capacitor can damage a 35 WATT, $10,000
laser diode if it is not current limited to a safe current for the diode!
Make sure the output of the laser diode is pointed safely away from you
but don't put anything right up against the output facet or window - at
these power levels, it may get toasted, especially if a dark color and
this will tend to destroy the diode as well.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the pinout.  Almost all the 800 to 1,000 nm, 0.5 to 6 W laser
 diodes I've played with have been mounted such that the positive (+) power
 supply lead is the case or bussbar.  The negative (-) is attached to a
 separate contact (which itself connects to the top of the laser diode chip via
 multiple gold wire bonds or a thin soldered wire).  I've only
 come across one exception and the diodes were some kind of specials
 labeled "R&D".
<p>
 If you aren't sure, the best thing to do is locate the specs (!!) or trace
 the circuitry of the driver/controller if available.  Else, it is possible
 to determine the pinout experimentally with little risk:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Start with the assumption that the case/bussbar is positive and the top
  or flying lead of the laser diode is negative.
<p>
 <li>Attach the power supply with current limiting resistor (make sure it's
  off and discharged!) and connect a voltmeter on its 2.5 to 5 V scale
  directly across the laser diode.  Make sure the output end of the laser
  diode is facing a safe place just in case you get more than you bargained
  for!  If all you are stuck with is an expensive variable current source,
  put a 100 ohm resistor across the laser diode so that current will be be
  converted to voltage (1 V/10 mA) - otherwise, there may be no way to limit
  the voltage across the diode before it is too late.
<p>
 <li>Start at 0 V and <b>slowly</b> increase the voltage while watching the
  meter.  For IR laser diodes, the voltage across the laser diode should start
  leveling off at about 1.5 to 1.7 VDC.  (Visible ones will be a little
  higher.)  If it goes much beyond this, you have the laser diode backwards, 
  there is a broken wire, or if your package has multiple pins, you don't have
  the correct ones.  <b>DO NOT</b> go above 2 VDC!  You risk destroying the
  laser diode totally from reverse breakdown (more than a few microamps will
  do it!  A typical spec is PIV of 3 V, 25 uA max).  Check and/or interchange
  connections and try again.  If the voltage doesn't go above 0.7 to 1.0 V,
  your connections are backwards and there is a reverse protection diode built
  into the laser diode assembly.  If the voltage doesn't increase very much at
  all, either the power supply or meter isn't connected properly or the laser
  diode is shorted from severe overload or reverse breakdown (but it might
  just be a bent bond wire/strip) or poor soldering job of the connections.
<p>
  On laser diode packages with multiple pins (e.g., TO3), there are many more
  combinations to check but each can be tested in a similar manner.  If you
  have the driver/controller, tracing its circuitry can greatly narrow the
  possibilities.
 </ul>
<p>
 <li>Now that you know the pinout, some means of detecting the laser diode's
  output is needed.  For visible laser diodes (up to 700 nm), initial
  determination of life/death can be made by eye.  For near-IR diodes up to
  about 850 nm, the eye still has some sensitivity and the emission will
  appear deep red but very faint, even for a high power diode (the longer the
  wavelength, the fainter it will appear.  Just realize, the actual intensity
  may be <b>10s of THOUSANDS</b> of times greater than it appears!).  Beyond
  some wavelength, there is absolutely no sensation of light.  I know 980 nm is
  totally invisible to me but the cutoff for individuals varies.  <b>DON'T</b>
  be tempted to peer close into the output aperture - it could be the last
  thing you see from that previously good eye.  For a 1 W laser diode, imagine
  all the light from a 20 W incandescent lamp being emitted from a source the
  size of a grain of sand!
<p>
  The safest way to monitor output power is with a proper laser power meter.
  An alternative is the <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct5">IR Detector Circuit</A>.
  Position its photodiode sensor an inch or so away from the laser diode's
  output.  The beam shape is highly astigmatic - 5 to 10 degrees horizontally
  but perhaps 40 to 60 degrees vertically.  Given the output power of these
  laser diodes, even with the sensor intercepting only a small part of the
  beam, the detector circuit may be overwhelmed (or literally smoked) quite
  quickly.
<p>
  A very simple way of detecting optical output is to place a piece of black
  electrical tape close to (but not touching - a millimeter or so) the front
  of the LD; at power levels of a few tens of mW, spots will be melted in the
  black absorbing material quite quickly.  At higher power levels, white paper
  will be charred.  CAUTION: Don't let either of these touch the facet of the
  LD; at the very least it will be coated with burnt stuff (the power density
  is highest there); it may also be permanently damaged.
<p>
 <li>Start at 0 V and slowly increase the current to the laser diode until
  threshold is reached and your detector (eyeballs or meter) show a
  significant increase in output power.  How far to push it?  Again, as with
  low power laser diodes, the only way to know for sure is from the spec sheet.
  But here are some <i>very</i> rough guidelines for 780 nm to 980 nm laser
  diodes (at 25 &deg;C):
  <p>
  <pre>
     Size of LD Chip     Threshold Current  Max Current  Max Output Power
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      0.5 x 0.5 mm             0.25 A           1 A           0.5 W
      0.5 x 1.0 mm             0.5 A            2 A            1 W
      1.0 x 1.0 mm             1.0 A            4 A            3 W
      1.0 x 1.5 mm             1.3 A            6 A            6 W
  </pre>
</ol>
<p>
Note that some laser diodes may handle 2 or 3 times these currents and output
powers but these should be safe conservative values.

<h4><A NAME="diothpl1">Determining High Power LD Specifications by Testing to
 Destruction</A></h4>

So, you inherited a bag of unmarked but big identical, but totally unmarked
laser diodes.  Can the safe operating current be determined experimentally.
<p>
Well, the answer is: maybe if you are willing to sacrifice one.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
As a GENERAL rule of thumb and barring infant mortality, ESD, or any other
manufacturing defects in the laser diode, proper heat sinking:
<p>
<ul>
<li>At 100% rated current most high quality, high power diodes (read American
 manufacture, around 808 nm or 980 nm) last for 5,000 to 10,000 hours.
<p>
<li>At 200% rated current, they last for tens to hundreds of hours.
<p>
<li>At 300% rated current, they generally last less than a minute.
</ul>
<p>
So, yes, you can test a diode to failure by slowly increasing the current
until failure occurs and take the current level that destroys the diode
almost instantly and divide by 3.  As far as whether this is an
acceptable way to determine the rated current of the diode, the normally
acceptable way is to have the manufacturer spec a current. :) Keep in mind that
these numbers apply to diode bars and C mounted diodes.  Can packages are a
little less efficient in coupling heat away from the diode normally, so they
may die a little quicker than normal.  In that case you may be running at a bit
lower than rated current if you divide by 3.

<h4><A NAME="diohpthr">Estimating Threshold Current of High Power Laser
 Diodes</A></h4>

While it's generally obvious when a low power laser diode changes from an LED
to a laser, for high power diodes there is significant power due to LED
emission near the lasing threshold.  For example, a typical 1 W laser diode
may produce 10 mW or more of incoherent light at around the lasing threshold.
The easiest way to locate the lasing threshold is with an optical spectrum
analyzer which will show when the narrow lasing line appears above the
broad fluorescence spectrum.  Without such an instrument, the lasing threshold
current can really only be estimated.  While knowing the exact lasing threshold
is probably not all that critical. it might be needed at least be able to
list the value in a table! :)
<p>
What I do is to infer the lasing threshold as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Using an adjustable laser diode driver, locate the approximate current
 for lasing by observing where the output starts to increase significantly.
<p>
<li>Measure the output power (P<sub>i</sub>) at two currents (I<sub>i</sub>)
 approximately 25 percent and 100 percent above this value.  Use values for
 I that will make calculations convenient.  CAUTION: This assumes a current
 of 100 percent above threshold is safe for the diode!
<p>
<li>Calculate the slope efficiency:
 SE=(P<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>1</sub>)/(I<sub>2</sub>-I<sub>1</sub>).
<p>
<li>Calculate the lasing threshold:
 I<sub>t</sub>=I<sub>1</sub>-(P<sub>1</sub>/SE).
</ol>
<p>
As an example, consider a diode where the current starts increasing quickly
above 550 mA with P<sub>1</sub> of 180 mW at I<sub>1</sub> of 0.75 A and
P<sub>2</sub> of 540 mW at I<sub>1</sub> of 1.25 A.  Then, SE=0.72 and
I<sub>t</sub>=500 mA.

<h4><A NAME="diodct3c">Characteristics of Some Typical High Power IR
 Platesetter Laser Diodes</A></h4>

Here are some data for the types of IR laser diodes used in graphic arts
platesetters and similar equipment.  The wavelength is typically between
820 and 880 nm with 0.5 to 1 W or more maximum output.  (High power diodes
operating at more useful wavelengths for DPSS laser pumping like 808 nm and
980 nm will have similar characteristics.)  Like other
high power laser diodes, these do not contain any monitor photodiode and are
driven by a constant current power supply.  These are often fiber-coupled
laser diodes which may feed a collimating lens assembly.  A typical unit
is shown in <A HREF="ptfcld1.jpg">Typical Presstek Fiber-Coupled Laser
Diode</A>.  Note that a substantial fraction of the raw output power of
the laser diode (up to 50 percent) is lost in coupling to the fiber
pigtail.  Thus, the specifications for the laser diode itself will show
a higher output power.
<p>
For help in wiring up unidentified diodes of this type, see the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioichp">Identifying Connections On High Power
Packaged Laser Diodes</A>.
<p>
As I've written many times: There is no way to know the maximum output
power for reasonable life expectancy of these or any laser diodes without
the manufacturer's specifications or testing several to destruction.
As a very rough rule of thumb, it's possibly safe to power a diode at up
to 4 to 5 times the threshold current if properly cooled.  So, for one
that starts lasing at 400 mA, 1,600 to 2,000 mA might be OK and it's possible
some will go much higher.  No guarantees and your mileage may vary.
<p>
Testing was done using an ILX Lightwave LDC-3900 laser diode controller with
wavelength determined using an Agilent or Ando optical spectrum analyzer if
not listed in the part number.  Temperature was set at 20 &deg;C.

The first batch are all fiber coupled with an SMA output connector which
attaches to a collimator as shown in the photo, above.

It's likely that Opto Power (now part of Spectra-Physics) is the manufacturer

diodes is identical to that of the Opto Power unit shown in

Although some people may list these Presstek and Opto Power diodes on eBay
as being rated at 2 watts, they are not.  I have tested one of each at currents
significantly greater than the value at 1 W.  Neither survived to produce 2 W.
AHH03131-2 reached 1.7 W at 2.75 A and

I believe these are actually similar diodes but I didn't use active cooling
on #1 and since the diode is on an internal TEC, thermal resistance is probably
rather high.  The current was turned on, the measurement was made, then
the current was turned off.  But even this would likely result in a very
substantial temperature rise.  Testing of #2 was done with the diode
temperature maintained at 20 &deg;C and this probably accounts for the
higher power readings.  Although the diode might survive
at 2 A or beyond, the TEC was incapable of maintaining 20 &deg;C above
about 1,750 mA though the heatsink was cool to the touch.  At 2 A, the
temperature was increasing at about 1 &deg;C per second even with 2.5 A

These are likely similar or identical to the SDL-2364-L2 (rated 1 W).  They

<p>
Although some people may list similar diodes on eBay as having a 2 watt
rating, they are not.  I have tested two samples at currents significantly
greater than the value at 1 W.  FC715 did survive for a few minutes at least
with 2 W of output at about 2.7 A but FC566 died suddenly at about 2.8 A before
reaching 2 W.  It is now a shadow of its former self with a maximum output
of about 100 mW.  Thus, it may be possible to get more than 1 W from these
diodes but life expectancy could be short, especially if driven above 2 A.

Not all platesetter devices have only a single laser diode inside.  I tested
one that actually had 10 diodes side-by-side with separate anode connections

The laser diode thresholds were about 450 mA producing 250 mW at 750 mA
for a slope efficiency of about 0.84.  I do not know what the rated power
is but the sticker on the laser diode package lists "6.5 W max" for all
10 diodes.  So, they are at least 650 mW each.  Based on the threshold,
they could easily be double this but no guarantees.
<p>
The outputs of the laser diodes are fast-axis corrected and reasonably well
collimated, though a rather elaborate set of beam shaping optics is intended
to bolt on to the laser diode package to ultimately create 10 closely spaced
spots from an 8.8X microscope objective for the platesetter engine.  The
unit I tested had two such laser diode/optics assemblies.

<h3><A NAME="diotrhp">Testing of Really High Power Laser Diodes</A></h3>

These are the type of laser diode that don't even reach lasing threshold
until 8 AMPS or in some cases, 16 A or more!  Maximum output power may be
10 or 20 or 50 WATTS - or more.  They are actually laser diode
bars or arrays consisting of several dozen multimode laser diodes on the
same piece of semiconductor and thus behave like multiple diodes side-by-side
(or in really high power cases, multiple of these sandwiched together).
<p>
If you have access to a commercial laser diode controller capable of
20 or 30 or 60 A, great!  For the rest of us, there are reasonably
safe (for the laser diode, that is!) alternatives.
<p>
What I have used is a high current switchmode power supply intended for
large TTL digital systems.  It regulates well at any load and
is capable of 50 A at 5 VDC.  I also have one
that will do 150 A if needed. :)  Make sure whatever you use has no
significant spikes/ripple and is well behaved on power cycling with <b>no</b>
overshoot when switched on at both light and heavy load.  A linear power
supply might be preferred due to lower noise and ripple, but high current
linear power supplies are large, heavy, and are relatively uncommon these days.
And, such a supply may not necessarily be any safer for the laser diode.
<p>
Current limiting is provided by 1 or 2, 0.1 ohm 50 to 100 W power resistors and
1 to 4 high efficiency high current series silicon diodes to drop the voltage.
A version of this rig is shown in <A HREF="qdhpldd1.jpg">Quick and Dirty High
Power Laser Diode Driver 1</A>.  The diodes have a voltage drop of about 0.5 V
at 20 A.  With an appropriate combination of resistors and diodes, a current
from about 5 or 6 A to 30 or 40 A can be selected.  A protection circuit (more
for peace of mind than actually likely to do much of anything) consisting of a
0.1 uF capacitor, 100 uF capacitor, 100 ohm resistor, and reverse polarity
prevention diode is connected at the laser diode being tested.
<p>
For operation of a few seconds - just enough to make an output power
measurement, active cooling isn't needed for the power supply components
and using the 100 W (or even 50 W) resistors instead of the 250 W dictated
by P=I*I*R at 50 A should be acceptable.
<p>
If the laser diode bar or array is already mounted in a massive heatsink,
it too will be fine for 10 or 20 seconds.  But if it is just a small
assembly, then cooling will be essential even for this short time.  Where
the diode package itself has water cooling lines, it may require flowing
water even if being powered for an instant.  If there is any doubt, assume
cooling is essential no matter how short the test.
<p>
All connections should be changed ONLY with power off and current at zero.
Even the charge on a 1 uF, 5 V capacitor can damage a 35 WATT, $10,000
laser diode if it is not current limited to a safe current for the diode!
All connections must be very secure using screw terminals or clamps - no
flimsy alligator clip leads!  Wiring must be adequately sized (#14 minimum, or
preferably #12 or larger, even for short runs).
<p>
Monitor the current by measuring the voltage drop across the power resistor(s).
<p>
And, don't forget the laser safety goggles and fire extinguisher!
<p>
For a more elaborate high power driver, see the section:
<A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsdhpl">Driving High Power Laser Diodes</A>
and <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpssg3">Sam's High Power Laser Diode Driver 1</A>.
<p>
CAUTION: Despite their size and output power, these laser diodes are
still extremely sensitive to ESD or current spikes from tiny charged
capacitors.
<p>
<b>Checklist/procedure for testing really high power laser diodes:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Assure that power supply is OFF, its output capacitors are discharged, and
 the current control is set to minimum.
<p>
<li>Remove laser diode from anti-static bag and mount securely to cold-plate
 (if separate).
<p>
<li>Leave shorting strap in place (or provide temporary shorting strap if the
 original shares stud locations with the main power connections) and attach
 power supply cables.  Double check polarity and tighten connections securely.
 Remove shorting strap.
<p>
<li>Attach cooling water lines in correct direction (if marked).  Start water
 flowing, making sure it goes through the laser diode cooling channels.
 Note that in the case of some really high power laser diodes,
 what might look like a separate cold plate actually
 sends water through channels in the laser diode itself vis a pair of tiny
 O-ring sealed connections on its bottom surface.
<p>
<li>Make sure a brick, concrete block, or other non-flammable beam stop is
 positioned as close to laser output aperture as practical for measurements.
<p>
<li>Set up laser power meter or some other means of measuring output power.
 It must be capable of handling the maximum possible output power at the
 current to be applied to the diode.
<p>
<li>Put laser safety goggles on your head in front of your eyes. and the eyes
 of anyone else present.
<p>
<li>Apply power and ramp up slowly to threshold current (between 15 and 20
 AMPs for the diodes described in the next section).  Confirm onset of lasing
 with IR detector card or other means.  Or, set your diode/resistor rig to
 the lowest current setting to start.
<p>
 CAUTION: If power as determined by brightness of glow or meter reading
 isn't as high as expected or decreases without reducing current, power
 down immediately as it is likely the cooling is inadequate.
<p>
<li>Increase current to desired operating level.  For an adjustable power
 supply or laser diode driver, this can be done directly.  For the
 diode/resistor rig, it means powering down, waiting for the capacitors
 to discharge, changing the jumper(s), and powering up again.
<p>
 For the types of diodes described in the next section, a red brick
 will begin to glow orange or yellow at the beam focus when the power
 exceeds 15 or 20 W.  Check uniformity of beam
<p>
<li>Make the power measurement, record reading and diode ID#.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Powering off/disassembly checklist:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Power down preferably by reducing current to zero and then removing AC
 power to the power supply.
<p>
<li>After a minute or so, turn off cooling water and disconnect water
 connections.
<p>
<li>Install shorting strap and then disconnect cables from diode.
<p>
<li>Remove diode from mounting and place in anti-static bag.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="diorhpd">Characteristics of Some Really High Power IR Diode
 Lasers</A></h4>

Here are a couple of WHOPPING BIG DIODE LASERS!
<p>
The first is shown in:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="bigdl1-1.jpg">BIG Diode Laser - Overall View</A>
<li><A HREF="bigdl1-2.jpg">BIG Diode Laser With Cover Removed</A>
<li><A HREF="bigdl1-3.jpg">BIG Diode Laser Showing Internal Components</A>
</ul>
<p>
The package is about 15 cm long and shoots a rectangular beam out the window
at the right that focuses to a 1.5 cm line about 15 cm beyond it.
On the sample in the photos, the threshold current is
around 17 AMPS (!!!) and the slope efficiency is about 0.5 or 0.6 W/A.  I
could only go to 30 A using my cobbled together power supply described in the
previous section.  At this current, it produces 6 or 7 W.  The slope
efficiency seems a bit low but perhaps some power is being lost inside
the box or maybe it's just a bit tired after long hours of plate-making.
A similar diode is rated at 35 W max and 65 A`max (whichever comes first)
with a typical threshold of 18 A.
<p>
I had assumed the wavelength would be around 830 nm based on
the intended application (see below).  However, I have been told that it is
made by Coherent, Inc., and may be closer to 810 nm which could be good for
side-pumping Nd:YAG.  Another sample which I tested for wavelength indeed
showed multiple modes between 808 and 813 nm.  This might be acceptable
for pumping Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> but probably less than ideal for Nd:YAG
which has a narrower absorption band.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The diode bar is just to the left of the two right-most screws in the
 third photo.  It's only about 6 mm (1/4 inch) in length and has a cylindrical
 microlens for fast axis beam correction glued directly to the diode mount.
 Unlike the smaller diode lasers described above, this is not a fiber lens
 but a glass plate with a molded cylindrical lens along the top edge.
<p>
<li>A few mm away from the diode is an "integrator" or "homogenizer".  This
 is a plate with a rippled surface (imagine wiggly vertical lines) whose
 purpose is to improve the horizontal uniformity of the output beam.
 It does this by imaging the diode stripe to focal points just in front of
 the plate.  The large objective lens assembly placed at a distance of
 exactly its focal length away collimates each of the plate's focal points
 spreading it over the entire width of the output beam.
<p>
<li>Glued to the left side of the integrator is a half wave plate to rotate
 the polarization from horizontal to vertical.  I assume this is needed for
 the intended application.
<p>
<li>A roof prism folds the optical path to reduce the size of the diode
 package.  So the beam path is from the diode shooting to the left, reflected
 off the roof prism, and exiting via the objective lenses at the right.
<p>
<li>There is a temperature sensor (its two pin connector is just visible
 in the third photo) but no TEC.  At this power level, water cooling is
 about the only option and for this particular diode, it is provided by
 a separate water coupling plate which sends water through channels
 in the laser diode package itself via a pair of small O-ring-sealed holes
 on its bottom surface.  Although, the diode seems to survive without
 water cooling for a few seconds of testing, this isn't recommended.
</ul>
<p>
Without the integrator plate, waveplate, and objective lenses, most or all
of the beam still exits the laser but it is modestly diverging.  How do I
know?  Because this laser originally had those components knocked off and
just bouncing around inside the package.  While there is some surface
damage to the broken off optics, they are still usable, though probably not
to factory specs.  Amazingly, the diode bar itself seems to have survived
despite the original trauma and subsequent shipping.
<p>
This laser is probably used in an Agfa platesetter along with a Silicon
Light Machines linear spatial light modulator using "Grating Light Valve" or
GLV technology as they call it.  Essentially, the output
of the diode is a rectangular beam that focuses to a 1.5 cm long line about
15 cm beyond the output aperture.  The focal point is at the modulator - a
MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical System) device that can selectively reflect
or diffract the beam at 256 or more individual locations.
<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.siliconlight.com/htmlpgs/glvtechframes/glvmainframeset.html">Silicon Light Machines Products and Technology</A> and
<A HREF="http://http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/xcalibur.pdf">Xcalibur
Platesetter Brochure</A>.
<p>
The reflected light from the GLV modulator is reimaged onto a master
printing plate rotated on a drum and thus scanned helically with some
number of pixels written simultaneously.  This has some key advantages.
Rather than having a gazillion individual diodes as in systems using the diodes
described above, this uses a single BIG diode laser.  The GLV device
provides higher resolution and greater flexibility as well.
And there should be a lot lower cost of maintenance unless, of course,
the BIG diode in the BIG diode laser dies!
<p>
The other BIG diode laser which I've tested is part of a mostly complete Agfa
platesetter print engine and includes an 80 AMP power supply.  The modulator
is also present, though I have no idea how to control it so I've just tested
the laser and power supply.
<p>
See: <A HREF="limodl-1.jpg">LIMO Diode Laser Based Platesetter Print
Engine</A>.
<p>
The diode laser is in the angled package labeled "LIMO" and is functionally
similar to the BIG gold one but the optical arrangement differs somewhat and
it has the water line connections directly to the diode package.  (Some
later versions of the Coherent BIG gold diodes do this as well, see below.)
<A HREF="http://limo-microoptic.de/">LIMO</A> is a manufacturer of
many types of high power diode lasers.  This exact model doesn't appear
on their Web site though.
<p>
The power supply and modulator are also water cooled.  For the power supply,
I assume this was just convenient since it doesn't really dissipate that
much power at least on the grand scheme of things and air cooling should
be adequate.  The modulator likely requires water cooling because when the
beam at a particular pixel is defracted rather than reflected, it probably
hits and is absorbed inside the GLV device and the total area is very
small.  The beam from the LIMO box exits just below the triangular
yellow warning sticker, hits the modulator, and is reflected underneath
through a couple of fairly fancy lenses.  One of these is a motor controlled
zoom lens to fine tune the size of the projected pattern onto the printing
plate.  Then the beam goes out the aperture in the front, just visible in the
upper left corner of the casting.
<p>
The power supply is slick. :)  It is a high efficiency switcher programmable
from about 3 A to 80 A via a 0 to 4 VDC control signal with a calibration of
approximately 20 A/V.  (It's not possible to shut off the output completely
and the linearity at low current isn't very good.  But 3 A is so far below
the lasing threshold that it really doesn't matter.)  The actual measured
current is available as another signal, also with a calibration of 20 A/V.
<p>

</PRE>
<p>
The power input is 180 to 250 VAC, though I suspect that this could be
converted to 90 to 125 VAC with some minor changes.  There are a pair of
large main filter capacitors that would be part of the usual doubler
but no obvious jumper for input voltage.  Besides the jumper,
the on-board fuses would need to be increased in current rating.
<p>
After first confirming the operation using a BIG laser diode simulator
consisting of a pair of high current silicon diodes and a 0.1 ohm 50 W
power resistor (part of my cobbled together high power driver was pressed into
service here!), I powered up the LIMO diode laser.  Its lasing threshold is
similar to that of the BIG gold one - between 18 and 20 A.  At a current
of 40 A, the output power is around 20 WATTs!  A piece of wood placed
in front of the modulator to protect it immediately starts smoking profusely
at this power level and would no doubt burst into flames after a few
seconds.  I expect that going to at least 60 A would be safe for the
diodes and should result in over 38 WATTs.  The CDRH sticker rating is
50 WATTs so even more power may be possible. :)  However, if it's similar
to the BIG gold diode, above, then the rated maximums for power and
current are 35 W and 65 A, respectively.
<p>
I tested another sample for wavelength and found it to be around 802 nm,
even further from the 830 nm than expected.  It's spectral width was
about 3 nm, somewhat narrower than that of the BIG gold diode, above.  This
one might be usable for side-pumping a YAG rod, something I might consider
attempting in the future.
<p>
Later, I powered a similar diode using my home-built driver.  See
<A HREF="sgdh1p1.jpg">Photo of Sam's High Power Laser Diode Driver 1 In
Action</A> (sgdh1p1.jpg) and the section:
<A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpssg3">Sam's High Power Laser Diode Driver 1
(SG-DH1)</A>.  No, it's not a blue-white lasing diode but simply my poor
confused digital camera's response to something it doesn't really
understand. :)  With a proper IR-blocking filter, a line on the brick would
be seen glowing yellow from the heat as the output at 40 A is about 22 W.
<p>
CAUTION: Water cooling is essential for proper operation and to avoid
damage to the diode.  Unlike the BIG gold diode laser which seems to be
happy for a few seconds at least without cooling even at reasonably high
current, the output of the LIMO diode laser drops off almost immediately
unless there is flowing water.  Apparently, there is very little thermal
mass between the laser diode bar and the water cooling channels.  The flow
can be quite low - almost a dribble - but make sure the diode laser is primed
by closing the red valve to the power supply and modulator cooling channels
for a short while to force water through the laser diode channels.  Then,
reopen it. Since the plumbing includes rubber tubing, don't let the water
pressure become excessive.  There must be a flow restrictor or thermostatic
valve in the diode laser water line since it seemed to significantly restrict
the flow at room temperature.  (There is a device with three wires attached
to it but I haven't determined its function.  I assume it's either a flow
detection sensor, a temperature sensor, or both.)
<p>
By the way, when water leaks <i>inside</i> one of these units, it's not
a pretty sight.  I was given one of the BIG gold diodes where this must have
happened.  Upon applying power, it was obvious that something was very wrong
as it was drawing at least 15 A at less than 1 V, almost a dead short, and
the current was erratic.  And the inside surface of the output window was
fogged!  There was also evidence of corrosion on the outside of the case
so I'm not really sure exactly what happened.  Maybe the water pressure
regulator failed and the pressure went too high blowing out some O-ring
seals and allowing water to both enter the interior and leak out of the
cooling lines.  Or, possibly, the leaks occurred at the O-ring seals as a
result of defective/cracked gold plating/paint.  Either way, when I received
the diode, the damage had been done.  At least it was probably a quick
painless death for the diode bar.  Too gruesome for pics though. :)

<h3><A NAME="diodct4">Methods of Sensing IR</A></h3>

Since the types of laser diodes from CD players and other optical storage
devices and laser printers produce IR wavelengths (e.g., 780 nm) and for all
intents and purposes are invisible, some means of sensing their output is
needed for testing.  There are a variety of ways of doing this.
<ul>
<li>A simple IR tester circuit using a photodiode can be easily constructed
  from components you probably already have in your junk box.  See the
  section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct5">IR Detector Circuit</A>.
<p>
<li>The device described in the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm3">Sam's
 Super Cheap and Dirty Laser Power Meter</A> can be used instead and will
 provide a quantitative measure of IR intensity.
<p>
<li>Some camcorders are sensitive to IR as well and will show a bright spot of
  light if aimed at a working source of IR.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.mcmelectronics.com/">MCM Electronics</A> lists 2
 different shaped cards for $7.29 each (#72-005: 3.5 x 2.5" card and 72-003:
  4.75 x 0.75" probe.  <A HREF="http://www.radioshack.com/">Radio Shack</A>,
  <A HREF="http://www.edsci.com/">Edmund Scientific</A>,
  <A HREF="http://www.roithner-laser.com/">Roithner Lasertechnik</A>, and
  others offer similar detectors.
<p>
  If you are trying to use a video camera or camcorder as an IR detector,
  confirm its sensitivity to near IR by looking at an active IR remote control
  through its viewfinder.  It may have a built in IR blocking filter which
  will prevent it from being sensitive to IR.  This may be removable.
<p>
<li>The salvaged IR sensor module from a TV or VCR may also be used as an IR
  detector.  These usually operate from a single supply (12 V typical) and
  output a logic signal.  However, since these are designed to work with
  the modulated IR signals from remote controls and similar devices, they may
  not respond reliably or at all to a steady IR output.  These can also be
  purchased from and electronic distributor and even Radio Shack.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="diodct5">IR Detector Circuit</A></h3>

This IR Detector may be used for testing of IR remote controls, CD player
laser diodes, and other low level near IR emitters.
<p>
Component values are not critical. Purchase photodiode sensitive to near IR
(750-900 um) or salvage from opto-coupler or photosensor. Dead computer
mice, not the furry kind, usually contain IR sensitive photodiodes. For
convenience, use a 9V battery for power. Even a weak one will work fine.
Construct so that LED does not illuminate the photodiode!
<p>
The detected signal may be monitored across the transistor with an
oscilloscope.

<h2>Testing of Some Selected Laser Diode and Driver Combinations</h2>

The following sections deal with using commercial laser diode drivers with
common low power laser diodes.

<h3><A NAME="dioichld">Testing the Toshiba TOLD9421 with the iC-Haus WJB Driver</A></h3>

Due to the availability of sample devices, I did some experiments with this
combination - which appears to be very nicely matched.  The parts values of
the iC-Haus demo board worked perfectly with the Toshiba laser diode.

<ul>
<li>The <A HREF=
 "http://www.toshiba.com/taec/components/Datasheet/TOLD9421DS.pdf">Toshiba
 TOLD9421</A> is a typical 650 nm index-guided laser diode with a 5 mW maximum
 output.  It uses the (now) less common larger 9 mm package.  However, that
 larger package does provide somewhat more of a built-in heat sink.
<p>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.ichaus.de/product.php?prod=iC-WJB">iC-Haus WJB</A>
 laser diode driver which supports both CW and pulsed operation up to about
 300 kHz with minimal external components.  It comes in an SO8 (SMT) package.
</ul>
<p>
The circuit I used is shown in <A HREF="ichldt1.gif">iC-Haus Laser Diode
Driver Test Circuit</A>.  This is basically their demo board attached to my
bench power supply (but the simpler one described in the section:
<A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpssglt1">Sam's Laser Diode Test Supply 1</A>
would also have been suitable).  For continuous operation, I clamped a power
transistor style heat sink to the laser diode.  Without this, the LD current
would increase significantly (by 20 percent or more) within less than a
minute.  With the heat sink, there is minimal change.
<p>
According to the spec sheet for the TOLD9421 the monitor photodiode (PD)
current can vary from .25 to 1.7 mA (at 5 mW) depending on the particular
device sample.  I started with RSET - the resistor that determines feedback
sensitivity - of 50 K ohms and with the function generator disconnected (so
that RMOD wouldn't matter).  Based on the transfer function of PD current to
RSET current, this would result in about 72 uA for the actual PD current - well
below the worst case minimum value (at 5 mW) for any sample of the TOLD9421.
Using my variable power supply, I ramped the voltage up gradually to assure
that the device was going to regulate properly - it leveled off at a fixed but
relatively weak output, above threshold but not very bright.  After some
trials with lower values of RSET, 15K resulted in an estimated output power of
about 1 mW.
<p>
The next step was to try some modulation.  Just attaching the function
generator (powered off with its output control all the way down) doubled LD
output since the output impedance of 50 ohms cut the value of RSET nearly in
half (to 7.5K).  Then, powering the function generator and cranking up it's
output level allowed me to easily modulate the LD's output between near no
light output (way below threshold) and perhaps 4 mW (still all estimated).  I
only tried frequencies I could see with my very accurately calibrated eyeballs
waving from side-to-side - from 0.1 Hz to a 1,000 Hz or so for these initial
experiments.
<p>
Modulation works by varying the voltage on the input to RMOD and thus the
current through it from the ISET pin which is maintained at a constant
voltage (about 1.22 V nominal).  The PD current is maintained at about 3
times (nominal) of this value.
<p>
I could detect no changes in the TOLD9421's behavior (either optical or
electrical) so at least so far none of this has resulted in any detectable
damage to the laser diode.  There has been no increase in threshold or
operating current and no measles (spots) in the device's output beam pattern.
(For a couple of minutes I thought there had been damage but the spots turned
out to be dirt on the LD window.)
<p>
CAUTION: For experiments like this with a signal or function generator, make
sure that no power or output glitches (as when changing modes) could result
in an excessively negative spike or offset which may force too much current
through the LD and damage or destroy it.  The addition of a reverse biased
diode across the modulation input is recommended to prevent excessive negative
voltage from appearing there.
<p>
Later, I popped in a
<A HREF="http://www.blueskyresearch.com/">Blue Sky
Research</A> PS106 which is a 7 mW Circulaser(tm) - a 650 nm laser diode with
a built-in microlens to correct for beam asymmetry and reduce divergence.
Since this device had a less sensitive monitor photodiode, I used an RSET of
39K which would run it at about 2.5 mW (I have a printout of this specific
sample's complete electrical and optical characteristics).  That worked fine
as well though I didn't puch my luck any further (e.g., boosting power or
modulation).  (The PS106 is no longer available but there are now many
other choices on the Blueskyresearch Web site.)

<h3><A NAME="dionvgld">Testing the NVG D660-5 with the NVG NS102
 Driver</A></h3>

Due to the availability of sample devices, I did some experiments with this
combination - which are designed to work well together probably for laser
pointer and diode laser module applications.

<ul>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.nvginc.com/d660nm5m.htm#D660-5">NVG D660-5</A> is
 a typical 660 nm index guided laser diode with a 5 mW maximum output.  It
 uses the very cute and compact 5.6 mm package.
<p>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.nvginc.com/ns102dri.htm">NS102</A> is an equally
 cute and very compact laser diode driver which includes a power adjust pot.
 It is designed for use inside laser pointers and compact laser diode modules.
 The entire PCB is only 5.4 x 7.8 mm.
</ul>

To evaluate these parts, I used a bench power supply but the one described in
the section: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpssglt1">Sam's Laser Diode Test Supply
1</A> would also have been suitable.
<p>
The toughest part about testing these was soldering the power supply leads
to the NS102.  I totally destroyed the first sample attempting to solder to
what looked like a pad for the positive power supply input but despite its
appearance, solder just wouldn't stick.  And in the process, I managed to
lift another pad clear of the device.  After a total kludge soldering job
that looked like it should have worked, there must still have been a problem
because upon powering up using my variable voltage power supply with
adjustable current limit, while the regulator appeared to be doing something
based on the brightness of the LD output, power supply current kept going
higher and higher as the input voltage was gradually increased.  Eventually,
the laser diode developed those dreaded spots and while still lasing, must have
lost approximately half of its mirror facet(s) as there is also a large dead
area in the beam pattern.
<p>
The second attempt was much smoother.  Rather than trying to solder to
that pad, the positive connection simply went to the common pin of the laser
diode. So, wiring is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Positive of power supply: LD can or heat sink or thin wire (e.g., #30
 wirewrap wire) to common pin of LD.
<p>
<li>Negative of power supply: Thin wire to pad on PCB at far end from LD.
<p>
<li>Laser diode: Trim leads to about 2.5 mm (1/8") if desired and form so
 they grip PCB resting on the three pads.  Just a touch of the soldering iron
 will form a nice joint - the pads must be pretinned with low temp solder
 and this is sucked up by the gold plated LD leads.
</ul>
<p>
For these laser diodes, the current for 5 mW output is around 27 mA.  I used
my variable power supply to assure that the current was limited to 20 mA, then
set the power adjust pot so that the regulator reduced the current.  At this
point, I turned up the current limit and finally adjusted the pot for 25 mA
current producing approximately 5 mW output.
<p>
I later tested that damaged LD using the iC-Haus WJB driver (see the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioichld">Testing the Toshiba TOLD9421 with the iC-Haus
WJB Driver</A>, above).  It would still operate stably with an output of a
milliwatt or so using optical feedback but about twice the normal current
(50 mA) for 5 mW output.  Of course, the unsightly blemishes in the beam
pattern were still there. :(  Interestingly, while determining a resistor
value that would work, the current repeatedly spiked to more than 5 times its
specified nominal value (pegging my 100 mA meter) for a good fraction of
second.  However, no further damage to the laser diode appears to have
occurred.  In fact, output power could still be pushed much higher - perhaps
up to 3 mW or more - but then the current was way off scale and I didn't hang
around to see what would happen next. :)  This is in sharp contrast to the
behavior of a laser diode I blew a while back where at a current only slightly
above the rated maximum, the conversion to an expensive LED was quite rapid.
<p>
This combination is designed to fit entirely inside NVG's machined brass
<A HREF="http://www.nvginc.com/lasdiohs.htm">Laser Diode Module Housing</A>
which provides the much needed heat sink (the laser diode current would begin
to creep up almost immediately due to the small thermal mass of the 5.6 mm
laser diode package) and an adjustable collimating/focusing lens.  Once
assembled, the commercial units are potted in Epoxy and the laser safety
sticker is wrapped around the outside. :)
<p>
While designed for CW applications, modulation of these drivers may also be
possible (but I have not done any testing).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsicd2">Comments on Some Commercial Drivers and
Detectors</A>.

<h3><A NAME="dionvgic">Testing the NVG D660-5 with the iC-Haus IC-WK
 Driver</A></h3>

The iC-Haus IC-WK laser diode driver is intended for CW and low frequency
modulated operation with a 2.4 to 6 VDC power supply.  (See:
<A HREF="http://www.ichaus.de/">iC-Haus</A> for detailed information,
under "Laser Drivers".)
<p>
I soldered another NVG D660-5 to the iC-Haus IC-WK demo board (WK2D).  The
WK2D can be used inside a laser pointer though not quite as small as the
NVG driver board described above.  The WK2D is intended for laser diodes
where the COM lead is the anode of the LD and the cathode of the PD (most
common type).  The IC-WK driver can be configured for any style of laser
diode package.  (There is also a WK1D demo board for laser diodes with
common LD/PD cathode and with common LD cathode/PD anode pin configurations.)
And, in conjunction with an external transistor or MOSFET, can be used with
higher current laser diodes as well.
<p>
It took about 2 minutes to solder the power supply wires and laser diode.
Thankfully, although the circuit board is fairly small, nice tinned solder
pads are present and soldering was a snap. :)
<p>
For my initial testing, I used the adjustable power supply described above.
I brought up the voltage just to the point where there was some output from
the laser diode and adjusted the pot until the driver started regulating.
Had I just switched on power within the driver's rated voltage range, it's
quite possible the laser diode would not have been happy.  Later, I replaced
the bench power supply with a pair of AA Alkaline cells which at 3 V, is well
above the 2.4 V required by this cute little driver.
<p>
The usable range of monitor photodiode current over the adjustment range
for the WK2D as configured is about 35 to 100 uA.  I realized later that
the monitor current for the D660-5 is only about half of the minimum required
for the WK2D to regulate so my poor little 5 mW diode was actually running at
about 10 mW.  The first one actually survived and would operate at this
output power continuously.  However, adjusting the pot to anything but the
highest value eventually resulted in its demise and some other samples weren't
as robust.

<h2>Use of Salvaged CD Laser Diodes, Substitution</h2>
<h3><A NAME="diousc0">Reasons to Leave the CD Laser Diode in the Optical
 Block</A></h3>

While your first instinct may be to rip the laser diode out of its original
mounting, this is often unnecessary and undesirable.  Depending on your
application, using all or part of the assembly may simplify positioning and
control of the laser beam.
<p>
<ul>
<li>For CD and other optical drives, the optical block (often called the
 optical pickup) includes the laser diode, various optics, objective lens
 mounted on two-axis actuator (focus and tracking), and the photodiode array
 for servo control and data read-back.
<p>
 Note: Some designs combine the laser diode and photodiode into a single
 package which is then mounted in the optical block.  This can still be used
 for either or both functions as long as you can identify the proper pins.
<p>
<li>For laser printers, the optical block will include the laser diode and
 collimating/focusing lens (and possibly some other optical elements).
<p>
 In some higher performance printers, there may be a Peltier cooler attacted
 to the back plate of the laser diode.  Pretty cool :-) (no pun....).
</ul>
<p>
Some laser diode power control and protection components may also be present.
<p>
Note: There are often a pair of adjacent solder pads connected to the laser
diode circuitry on the flex cable or circuit board associated with the optical
block.  When handling the assembly but not actually attempting to power the
laser diode, it is a good idea to short these together with a drop of solder
using a grounded soldering iron.  This will prevent the possibility of ESD
damaging the laser diode.
<p>
Where the laser diode is to be used as part of a precise optical apparatus
for close range sensing or scanning, for example, the entire optical deck
(including the stable mounting and sled drive mechanism) may be useful intact.
For the typical three-beam pickup (most common), this will provide precise
control of beam position: Y (focus), X-coarse (sled drive), X-fine (tracking).
<p>
There are several good reasons to leave your CD laser diode installed in the
optical block assembly even if you are not going to use it with the objective
lens and focus and tracking actuators which were part of the pickup:
<ul>
<li>The metal casting provides the very important heat sink which is necessary
  for continuous operation.  Not all optical blocks are made of metal but for
  those that are, the cooling function could be important.
<p>
<li>There is less risk of damaging the laser diode through careless handling and
  ESD.
<p>
<li>There may be a collimator lens in there - probably the first or second
  optical element in front of the laser diode.  It may be combined with the
  laser diode in its metal barrel.  If there is a collimator, you should be
  able to get a nice nearly parallel beam without much work.  At most, a
  small lens will be needed to optimize it.
<p>
  Remove the objective (front) lens and its associated coils unless you
  require them for a short range application.  They will likely come off as
  a unit without too much effort.  However, try not to destroy this assembly
  as you never can tell what might be needed in the future.
<p>
<li>The multisegment photodiode sensor and focus and tracking actuators may be
  useful for a variety of applications.  Think twice before ripping it apart
  if you require any of the capabilities originally present!
</ul>
While there are many variations on the construction of optical pickups even
from the same manufacturer, they all need to perform the same functions so the
internal components are usually quite similar.
<p>
Here is the connection diagram for a typical Sony pickup:

</PRE>
The laser diode assembly and photodiode chip connections are typically all on
a single flex cable with 10 to 12 conductors.  The actuator connections may
also be included or on a separate 4 conductor flex cable.  The signals may
be identified on the circuit board to which they attach with designations
similar to those shown above.  The signals A,C and B,D are usually shorted
together near the connector as they are always used in pairs.  The laser
current test point, if present, will be near the connections for the laser
diode assembly.
<p>
It is usually possible to identify most of these connections with a strong
light and magnifying glass - an patience - by tracing back from the components
on the optical block.  The locations of the laser diode assembly and photodiode
array chip are usually easily identified.  Some regulation and/or protection
components may also be present.
<p>
Note: There are often a pair of solder pads on two adjacent traces.  These
can be shorted with a glob of solder (use a grounded soldering iron!) which
will protect the laser diode from ESD or other damage during handling and
testing.  This added precaution probably isn't needed but will not hurt.  If
these pads are shorted, then there is little risk of damaging the laser diode
and a multimeter (but do not use a VOM on the X1 ohms range if it has one) can
be safely used to identify other component connections and polarity.

<h3><A NAME="diorepl">Replacing a Laser Diode of Unknown
 Specifications</A></h3>

Specs of laser diodes with similar wavelengths vary quite a bit, especially
the monitor photodiode current sensitivity.  You can't just drop in any old
laser diode that fits and expect it to work even if the pinout is the same.
It might indeed work, it might be too dim, or it might blow out.  There is
a good chance of the latter.  The only way to be sure is either to analyze the
circuit to know what its compliance range (drive current and feedback current)
is or to determine the actual specs of the original laser diode.  Only then
can a suitable substitute be selected.  Another alternative is to make changes
in the driver circuit to handle an available replacement.  Note that for
CD, DVD, and other similar applications, even an exact replacement may not
work without precise optical and electronic alignment since the physical
position and orientation of the laser diode chip, as well as its precise
output power, may be critical.  Also see the next section.

<h3><A NAME="diousc1">Substituting One Type of Laser Diode for Another</A></h3>

While the small laser diodes we are dealing with are similar in many ways,
there are enough differences such that substituting one for another is not
trivial.  The problems are fourfold (at least!):
<ol>
<li>The package type and size may differ.  The new one may not fit properly!
<p>
<li>The pin configuration and polarities of the laser diode and the monitor
   photodiode may differ.  The latter, in particular, could require substantial
   modifications or total redesign of the driver circuitry.
<p>
<li>The driver circuitry will need to be modified for the different electrical
   characteristics of the replacement laser diode.
<p>
<ul>
   <li>The required current will be different.  For example, it is probably
     lower for an IR laser diode than for a visible one.
<p>
   <li>The monitor photodiode sensitivity will be different.
<p>
   If you were to just pop in an IR laser diode in place of a visible one,
   either it will not work at anywhere near maximum output and/or it may blow
   instantly.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Where the wavelengths differ substantially (e.g., 780 nm vs. 670 nm) the
   optics may no longer focus or collimate properly.  With luck, there will be
   enough of an adjustment range - if the optics are not totally sealed and
   glued in place!
</ol>
This can probably be done but expect to blow some laser diodes if you are not
extremely careful - and even perhaps if you are!

<h3><A NAME="diorcld">Removing the Cover from a Laser Diode</A></h3>

Should the optical window on a metal laser diode package become damaged or
broken, it may be possible to remove the entire cover.  I don't recommend
attempting to break out the window for fear of damaging the actual laser
diode chip just behind it.  Rather, take a triangular jeweler's file and
make a groove as close to the base as possible all the way around, going
just deep enough to make it through the outer case.  The entire cover will
then pop off.  Securely SHORT the leads of the laser diode together to
prevent ESD damage as you do this.  While the exposed laser diode chip
won't be as protected as inside the can, with care it will survive
especially if some substitute means of keeping out environmental
contaminants is provided.

<h2>Laser Diode Life, Damage Mechanisms, COD & ASE, Drive, Cooling</h2>
<h3><A NAME="dioldl0">Laser Diode Life</A></h3>

For all intents and purposes, low power laser diodes in properly designed
circuits do not degrade significantly during thousands of hours of use or when
powered on or off.  However, it doesn't take much to blow them (see the
sections: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diolpv0">Low Power Visible Laser Diodes</A> and
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diolpv1">CD Player and Other Low Power IR Laser
Diodes</A>).  I have seen CD players go more than 10,000 hours with no
noticeable change in performance.  This doesn't necessarily mean that the
laser diode itself isn't gradually degrading in some way - just that the
automatic power control is still able to compensate fully. However, this is a
lower bound on possible laser diode life span.
<p>
Some datasheets list expected lifetimes for laser diodes exceeding 100,000
hours - over 12 years of continuous operation.  Of course, I trust these
about as much as the latest disk drive MTBFs of 1 million hours. :-)
<p>
Laser diodes that fail prematurely were either defective to begin with or,
their driver circuitry was inadequate, or they experience some 'event'
resulting in momentary (greater than a few microseconds) overcurrent.  What
this means is that with cheap driver electronics such as found in many laser
pointers, leaving the thing on continuously may result in much longer life
than repeatedly pulsing it.
<p>
As noted elsewhere, a weak laser diode is well down on the list of likely
causes for CD, LD, MD, and DVD player, as well as laser printer problems.
<p>
High power laser diodes may have considerably shorter life expectancies than
the 5 mW variety - 10,000 hours or less.
<p>
And, high temperature operation can reduce life expectancy, possibly by as
much as a factor of 2 for each 10 &deg;C rise above the temperature quoted
in the device's specifications.  Thus, a laser diode with a quoted life of
10,000 hours at 25 &deg;C, might only last 125 hours at 55 &deg;C.  Not
that it will actually fail at 125 hours and 1 second, but its maximum output
power will be reduced by 50 percent.  I expect that there is a wide variation
on the extent to which this applies depending on device type, how close it is
operated to its specified maximum power, and all sorts of other factors.
<p>
Of course, in the grand scheme of things, even LEDs gradually lose brightness
with use.
<p>
(From: Gregory J. Whaley (gwhaley@tiny.net).)
<p>
There is one thing to keep in mind about laser diode lifetimes.  The time to
failure probability distribution is quite wide, meaning that some laser's
lifetime will be significantly less than the 5,000 hour mean, and some will be
much, much longer than the mean.  Lasers are not like light bulbs where they
"wear out" and have a predictable lifetime.  The main life limiting factors in
a laser diode are related to how many crystal defects are present in the
device when it is made.  If you are lucky to have a diode with very few
defects, then your laser may last nearly forever.  If you are not so lucky, it
may only last a few hours.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl1">How Can I Tell if My Laser Diode has Been
 Damaged?</A></h3>

Overdrive or other abuse of a laser diode may result in total destruction and
instant conversion to a DELD (Dark Emitting Laser Diode).  However, what is
more likely to happen is that the device will either still produce some
coherent output (but at reduced power levels) or turn into an expensive LED.
<p>
If you don't know the life story of your laser diode, see the section:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodct1">Testing of Low Power Laser Diodes</A> before
you contribute to its demise!
<p>
Assuming the device was operating above its threshold current with a nice
bright output beam prior to the 'event', some or all of the following may
be in evidence:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The output intensity is somewhat reduced at the same current level - The
 laser diode has likely been damaged but not totally destroyed.  It may still
 be usable but will no longer be able to produce its full rated output power.
 However, its beam profile will likely have suffered (see below).  Don't be
 tempted to boost the laser diode current to obtain the same output power as
 before.  You will likely cause further damage and possibly complete its
 conversion to an expensive LED.
<p>
 If you return a damaged laser diode to a driver that uses optical feedback
 to stabilize output power, the laser diode will likely be destroyed if the
 circuit increases the drive current to its maximum limit in a futile attempt
 to achieve the expected output power.
<p>
<li>The output intensity is much much lower at the same current - You have an
 expensive LED.  Note that the lack of coherent light will not be instantly
 obvious from the optical properties of the output beam.  You will still be
 able to collimate or focus it quite nicely compared to an LED because the
 emitting area is much smaller than an LED - perhaps as little as 1 x 3 um
 for a 5 mW laser diode compared to around 250 x 250 um for a typical LED.
 However, the intensity of a functioning laser diode has the characteristic
 wedge shaped output pattern while that of the resulting LED is more diffuse.
 Thus, viewing the output will result in a distinct peak close to the optical
 axis if it is still a laser diode.  (Of course, I assume this <i>viewing</i>
 is being done safely!)
<p>
<li>Beam intensity doesn't increase dramatically as the current is raised (as
 it would with the positive feedback of an intact laser cavity) and there
 will be no distinct threshold; output will be pretty much linear with
 respect to current.
<p>
<li>The output power doesn't change monotonically with current - This is
 particularly evident on higher power laser diodes that have been
 traumatized.  This may be due to a variety of damage mechanisms including
 (1) that the preferred transverse mode structure changes with increasing
 current, the damaged areas of the facets (mirrors) will interfere with
 the smooth increase in output power and (2) impurity migration or other
 defects in the junction due to excessive current.  There will be certain
 current levels where the output power will dip a bit, decreasing when the
 current is increased.
<p>
<li>The beam characteristics have changed - A damaged mirror will likely
 result in all sorts of effects on the beam even if the device still lases.
 It may cut off part of the beam changing its shape, symmetry, or uniformity;
 act like a slit or diffraction grating and produce side-lobes, or any of a
 number of phenomena resulting in unsightly blemishes that can only be
 described with photos of the beam profile (more below).  Slight damage may
 result in what I like to call "measles" - a few dark spots at random
 locations.  However, first clean the laser diode's window - I have been
 misled into thinking damage had occurred when in fact only some specs of
 dust had decided to land on the window!
<p>
 For the typical low power laser diode (e.g., NVG D660-5), a common effect
 is for the normally nice smooth elliptical beam to develop dark stripes
 parallel with the fast axis corresponding to damaged sections of the facet.
 With my experiments (some semi-intentional, others accidental), they were
 more or less symmetric on either side of the center of the beam.
 Interestingly, on a few samples, some degree of this effect was totally
 reversible when current was reduced indicating that actual damage hadn't
 yet taken place.  On one in particular, it was possible to run at a total
 output power (every photon captured by my power meter) of over 15 mW (keep
 in mind that these are rated 5 mW max) but after a few seconds, the banding
 would start appearing.  Killing power and letting the device cool then
 restored the normal beam pattern.  At an output of 10 mW, it could run all
 day without problems.  At some output above 15 mW, the banding occurred
 instantly and was permanent.  (There was no heatsink on this device for
 any of these tests).
<p>
 For high power laser diodes such as the type used to pump solid state lasers,
 the location of facet damage be even more clearly seen in the beam pattern.
 Since the emitting aperture of these may be 100 um or more, projecting the
 output onto a white screen using a short focal length lens (e.g., one from
 a CD player) will yield the distribution of lasing along the aperture.  Set
 up the distance between the lens and screen to be about 40 mm.  This will
 require an LD-to-lens distance of a few mm (for the CD player lens of 4 mm
 focal length).  The projection will then be a line 2 or 3 mm in length.  A
 new/good LD will have a smooth and nearly constant brightness (if visible or
 through an IR viewer) but a damaged one will have significant variations
 in brightness as well as places where there is no light at all.  A common
 failure characteristic is to just have the side lobes with nothing in the
 middle.  However, this terminal disease would also be obvious in the
 unfocussed beam pattern.  Such serious damage may even be readily apparent
 as different color/rough areas on the end facet using a magnifier or low
 power microscope.
</ul>
<p>
For some diodes/types of damage, these effects can be quite dramatic and also
violate our belief in instantaneous and permanent damage mechanisms with
respect to laser diodes.  One of my NVG D660-5 laser diodes (5 mW max) was
subjected to an overcurrent event which resulted in total loss of regulation
by its driver (perhaps the rear facet was damaged reducing optical power to
the monitor photodiode).  The usual outcome of such a failure would be a
totally fried laser diode.  However, with this sample, the beam pattern
fluctuated wildly as current was increased from threshold with side-lobes
appearing and disappearing and changing position, with the intensity of the
beam diminishing and finally vanishing entirely.  However, this was all
totally reversible by simply reducing the current!  At one particular current,
the output looked approximately normal with an output power of 10 mW - twice
the diode's rating  In short, even after being subject to such abuse, this
tough diode still exceeded its original specs!  It finally succumbed to
further COD (Catastrophic Optical Damage) when switched on at too high a
current after cooling down and produced even stranger beam patterns but less
maximum power.  Then, it died completely, turning into a 39 ohm resistor. :(
<p>
(Portions from Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
A way to determine if a laser diode is damaged is by shining the uncollimated
beam on a white screen and looking at the spread of light intensity - the
beam profile.
<p>
This method works with all laser diodes where the light is visible (up to a
wavelength of about 800 nm), or with a CCD camera or other sensor array,
further into the IR - or UV (wishful thinking).
<p>
A working laser diode, will produce an elliptical beam, that is brightest in
the longitudinal axis, and tapers off in brightness towards the edges.  Some
may have slight bumps or dips or hints of an interference pattern but their
location will usually be relatively symmetric - if one of these features
occurs on one side, there will be a similar one on the other.
<p>
If you drive a diode at even very slightly above its maximum limit, you will
cause permanent damage to the diode over time.
<p>
If you take a diode, then drive it with the correct current, the above beam
profile will be produced. If you begin to slowly increase current, up to a
certain point, the optical output will increase. Continuing to increase the
current beyond this upper limit, the appearance of the beam will begin to
change, the output will start to decrease, then the beam will have light and
dark bands through it - the diode junction and/or mirror facets have now been
damaged.
<p>
At this point, the diode is still producing coherent radiation, with slightly
reduced output power. If you try and collimated this beam, you will end up
with a spot that has light and dark areas.
<p>
This type of damage is caused by exceeding the limits of the structure of the
semiconductor material and is irreversible.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl2">How Sensitive are Laser Diodes, Really?</A></h3>

When asked the question: "How sensitive are laser diodes to drive and
handling?", there will likely be a variety of responses from either side:
<p>
<blockquote>
"I just connected a bare laser diode to an automobile battery without any
 other components and it is working just fine.  I have never used any ESD
 precautions.  In fact, I have a wool sweater on at this moment and can draw
 some really juicy sparks from everything I touch."
</blockquote>
<p>
through:
<p>
<blockquote>
"I have blown several hundred laser diodes and I have been following all the
 manufacturer's guidelines with respect to ESD protection and drive.  I am
 even using their recommended circuit layout and $4,000 power supplies.
 Nothing seems to help."
</blockquote>
<p>
Not all laser diodes are created equal and their susceptibility to damage
through improper handling or improper drive likely varies widely.  Here is
a discussion of some of the issues:
<p>
(From: Eric Rechner (eric_r@3dm.com).)
<p>
<blockquote>
"Does anyone have any experience with Hitachi laser diode HL7843MG 5 mW 780nm?
 I find this diode to be possibly extremely sensitive (ESD??), more so than
 any other 780nm laser diode.  Does anyone know if there are problems with
 Hitachi MQW type diodes?  Are MQW diodes more sensitive to ESD than Double
 Heterojunction diodes?  Does anyone have info on possibly 'bad' or defective
 lasers out there?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Jon Elson (jmelson@artsci.wustl.edu).)
<p>
Strange.  I think I've used some of these.
<p>
I hear everybody babbling about extreme static sensitivity on these devices,
yet I've never had a failure, and I've been using just the usual minimum
precautions with any semiconductor device.  I suspect that people may be
exceeding the optical power MAXIMUMS on the devices.  I've been very
conservative on that, since the devices only carry an optical maximum, and
don't have that correlated to forward diode current (difficult, because it
varies strongly with temperature).  I try to run them at a good bit less than
rated power, maybe 2 to 3 mW optical output.  I'm using a diode sold by
Digi-Key for $19.00, just because it is cheaper than the Panasonic in the
5.4 mm case.  I think the manufacturer is NVG or something like that.  I've
got 10 of them I am working with, designing a closed-loop driver for a
photoplotter, which pulses the lasers on and off as fast as 10 us on, 10 us
off.  It is working pretty well now.  I included a series resistor (as well
as the control transistor), so that if the loop becomes unstable or the
sensing diode gets disconnected, it won't fry the laser diode.
<p>
(From: Dr. Mark W. Lund (lundm@xray.byu.edu).)
<p>
The babbling starts here: You don't have to be a total idiot to blow these
things, in fact I have blown a few myself.  Identifying the source of the
trouble is extremely costly and difficult because it only takes a spike of a
few nS to to the damage.  I would say that 99.9999% of the time it is the
power supply.  Either it spikes on turn-on, turn-off, or at random.  We used
to toast lasers with a $5,000 laser diode power supply that would spike every
time you sent certain signals on the IEEE 488 control line. This was a tough
one to figure out, I can tell you.  In the process we tried to damage one
using static to try to get a handle on the sensitivity, but were not able to
get a catastrophic failure this way (we may have induced some latent failures,
however).  Other laser diodes may vary.
<p>
(From: Jon Elson (jmelson@artsci.wustl.edu).)
<p>
Ah! This is good anecdotal evidence!  I've often suspected that there might
be more of this going on, and instead of examining the drivers, people just
attribute problems to an invisible gremlin!  I sure can see how a closed
circuit driver can oscillate or overshoot on transients, and there could be a
situation where some percentage of drivers will be less stable due to
component tolerances.  Unless you rigorously test a good batch of your
drivers, you could have this sort of thing and not know it.  (Of course, any
time you put a computer in the loop, especially one that is canned inside
an instrument, then the probability of unanticipated gremlins increases
dramatically!).
<p>
Of course, I was designing a fixed-purpose driver to be used in a specific
application, inside an instrument, so I had it easier than the guys designing
a lab-quality pulser for who knows what application.  So, I could put in a
resistor, which will limit current to some 'safe' level, even if the loop is
unstable, which it certainly was when I was tuning up my driver.
<p>
I DO use generally sound anti-static precautions, almost subconsciously, to
protect all semiconductor devices.  But, I am aware that I have occasionally,
by accident, touched a cable going to the laser diode before I was grounded,
and I have never noted a catastrophic failure.
<p>
I will have to go through some rigorous life-testing to make sure I'm not
causing latent failures, but I've run these diodes for quite a few hours while
testing things, and nothing of note has turned up yet.
<p>
By babbling, I meant some items in print media, as well as a lot on this and
other newsgroups, indicating that if you even touch one lead of a diode laser,
it is ABSOLUTELY destroyed, with a probability of 1.000!  Obviously not true!
Your comments are well reasoned, and indicate real experience.  Others have
also written that only a huge corporation, with millions in test equipment,
could ever make their own laser diode driver.  Now, clearly, the nanosecond
multi-watt pulsers ARE much more difficult to do right, fast risetimes without
overshoot is tricky.  But, I did it in my basement with just over $1,000 in
test equipment, mostly a decent oscilloscope.  I also had the confidence that
if I DID blow a few diodes, it wasn't so painful at $19 each.
<p>
So, now, I'm babbling!
<p>
(From: Eric Rechner (eric_r@3dm.com).) 
<p>
Just an update on the outcome of my question about Hitachi laser diodes,
above.  At that time, large numbers of the diodes in question
were dying prematurely (we were running at about 80% full power at a
temperature between 20 and 30 &deg;C, CW for several weeks in
triangulation sensors).  Our diode module supplier had the facilities to
inspect the laser chips using electron microscopy and apparently found
that new diodes exhibited oxidation on the facet.  They believed this to
be a process problem (contamination) at the manufacturer end.  The last I
heard, the diode module supplier credited us with replacement lasers - there
were about 1000 pieces, but this took a great deal of 'fighting'....

<h3><A NAME="dioldl3">Laser Diode Damage Mechanisms</A></h3>

A variety of effects are responsible for laser diode failure.  The one that
most people are most fearful of is Catastrophic Optical Damage (COD) to the
end facets due to excessive optical power density through them.  This is not
just simple overheating as with an underrated resistor but a complex process
that can take place on a very short time scale.
<p>
With the active area of the end-facets of some laser diode being as small as
1 x 3 um, it isn't surprising that a little too much power will kill it.  The
power density of 5 mW through that aperture is 1,666,666,666 W/square meter or
167 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>!  Apparently some types of optical materials when
properly processed and undamaged can handle more than this without a problem
but GaAlAs or whatever of the laser diode's mirrors isn't one of them.
(Some manufacturers specify the emitting aperture of their laser diodes to be
much larger - 10 x 60 mm being a typical value.  However, these dimensions are
inconsistent with their beam divergence which is similar to that of the much
smaller aperture.  If the actual emitter were that large, power density would
drop by a factor of 200 and it would seem that COD would not be a major
concern at the same power level.)
<p>
However, overall thermal damage is also possible even - or especially - with a
laser diode driver using optical feedback.  When you turn up the power control,
there may initially be higher output.  But as the laser diode heats up over
a few seconds or minutes, its output with respect to current decreases and the
regulator will keep increasing the current to compensate - potentially a
runaway condition which can also result in damage or death to the laser diode.
A large heat sink, active (e.g., Peltier or heat-pipe) cooling, or dunking in
liquid nitrogen may help if you are really determined to get every last photon
from your laser diode! :)
<p>
Or, where the laser diode is powered from a constant current source and set for
a higher output when warmed up, it may blow instantly the next time it is
turned on after having been off for a while.  The reason: For the same current,
the laser diode's optical output is greater when cold and may exceed the COD
limits of the its end facets.
<p>
In other words, there are many interesting and creative ways to convert a
laser diode into a DELD or expensive LED!
<p>
(From: Gregory J. Whaley (gwhaley@tiny.net).)
<p>
I will assume the effect is Catastrophic Optical Damage (COD) of the facet.
This is an interaction between the temperature of the facet and its optical
absorption.  When the temperature of the facet grows, the absorption can also
grow which feeds back positively to the temperature and the temperature "runs
away" until it is physically damaged.  My understanding is that this is
extremely fast, certainly less than a microsecond, probably less than a
nanosecond.  COD is often cited as the mechanism which makes laser diodes
extremely ESD sensitive and the ESD discharges can be quite brief.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl4">Variation in Laser Diode Damage Sensitivity</A></h3>

(From: Rajiv Agarwal (rajivagarwal@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Optical damage in a laser diode is a fairly complex phenomenon so it is hard
to give time and/or power to damage.  But based on my experience I'll give
some numbers.
<p>
Typical 5 mW telecom laser diodes (1300 or 1550 nm) are really underated as
far as optical power goes and they in general can be driven at 2 to 3 times
their rated power without any immediate damage though their lifetime may be
months instead of tens of years.  High power diodes (e.g., 1 W) on the other
hand are rated near their maximum optical power.  How much higher they can be
driven is a function of pulse width and duty cycle.  To give some typical
numbers at a pulse width of 1 ms and duty cycles of a few percent: A diode may
be driven at up to 50 percent higher and at pulse width of about 50 ns; at a
duty cycle of 0.1% it may driven at up to 5 - 10 times the rated power.
<p>
A diode that has suffered COD is already dead so its ESD sensitivity is a moot
point.  On the other hand a diode that has been overstressed optically is more
ESD sensitive.  This effect works in reverse too, i.e., a diode that has
undergone an ESD discharge may only be able to handle lower optical power.
<p>
I don't think a time for optical damage can be stated without knowing the
stress conditions and the type of diodes.  A diode stressed at 20 to 50% may
not suffer any catastrophic damage at all but just die out gradually - just
much faster than normal lifetimes.  At about 100% overstress, degradation can
be catastrophic, and fairly fast.  Even then the diode can generally be
operated at the higher powers for quite a while (seconds) before the onset of
COD.  Once the COD starts it probably is quite brief.  I'm not sure about the
numbers and figures mentioned (nano - microseconds) may be correct for actual
COD to occur.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl5">What is ASE of laser diodes?</A></h3>

(From: David Schaafsma (drdave@jnpcs.com).)
<p>
ASE usually stands for Amplified Spontaneous Emission.  It is part of any
lasing process, and is just what it sounds like - spontaneous emission (not in
the lasing mode) that gets amplified by the gain medium in the cavity.  I find
it easiest to think of this in terms of phase: The lasing mode will have one
well-defined phase, while all the noise (ASE) modes will have some phase shift
relative to the lasing mode.  ASE is mostly a concern when you are trying to
send modulated signals (e.g. bits) with your laser diode.  In that case, ASE
is essentially a noise source which degrades the signal (or S/N).  In most
electrically-pumped diodes, ASE is not so much a problem as RIN (Relative
Intensity Noise), which can raise the bit error rate by changing the relative
levels of the "on" bits.
<p>
L-I characteristic for ASE is going to follow the lasing mode for the low part
of the current range, but at some point (depending on cavity Q and carrier
lifetime), you're going to get spontaneous emission clamping, where the ASE
will stop increasing superlinearly.  I'm not sure that this is the same as
COD, where you should see a sharp decrease in optical power output.
<p>
There are a number of good laser physics books which may discuss this - try
Sargent, Scully and Lamb ("Laser Physics") or Yariv ("Quantum Electronics").

<h3><A NAME="dioldl6">Comments on Driving Laser Diodes Without Optical
 Feedback</A></h3>

(From: Dwight Elvey (elvey@civic.hal.com).)
<p>
If you intend to use the laser without the feedback, one has to realize that
there are a number of problems.  One is that as the temperature goes down, the
laser efficiency goes up. This tends to cause the laser diode to destroy itself
at lower temperatures while running that same current that was OK at some
higher temperature.  Generally, if the temperature doesn't vary to much, one
can use something as simple as a limiting resistor and not run the laser at its
highest output. I once made a burn-in driver for some power lasers that used
constant current sources that had no feed back but I had to preheat the diodes
to 100 &deg;C before using that high a level of current. The level of
current used would have wiped the diodes out at room temperatures.
<p>
The hardest part of the whole thing was making the circuit to have controlled
levels of current during power on and power off. Most things like op-amps are
not specified under these conditions. My first attempt wiped out 10 diodes :-(
when I turned the power on.
<p>
To run the diodes at there maximum light out safely, requires using the
feedback photo diode.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl7">Frequency Response of Internal Photodiodes</A></h3>

This will determine the maximum frequency at which closed loop optical
feedback can be used for laser diode modulation as well as the minimum
filtering requirements for CW driver circuits.
<p>
Note that the photodiode is NOT part of the laser diode structure - it sits
behind the laser diode in the typical package.  So, you can actually test its
frequency response with an external modulated light source (like an LED or
another laser diode driven by a high speed pulse generator) independent of the
laser diode itself.  The light doesn't have to pass through the laser diode.
Although not terribly clear, the photodiode can be see in the
<A HREF="ldclose.gif">Closeup of a Typical Laser Diode</A>.
<p>
(From: Richard Schmitz (optima-prec@postoffice.worldnet.att.net).)
<p>
The frequency response of the photo diode (PIN diode) is usually shown in
the back of the manufacturers laser diode data book.  In the case of
Toshiba's visible diodes, the freq. response is shown as flat out to about
10 MHz and it rolls off to -3dB at about 175 MHz.  With the newer diodes used
in the DVD products, the freq. response seems to be a little better, curves
for the TOLD9441 show the response out to 1 GHz, down -3dB.  If you need
exact details, contact a distributor and get the latest Toshiba data sheets.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl8">Cooling of Laser Diodes</A></h3>

Cooling a laser diode will have obvious physical effects like shortening of
the cavity - so mode hopping would be expected.  However, there will also be
changes in wavelength, and efficiency will increase.  But going to far may
cause structural damage.  The efficiency will also increase - to a point -
as the temperature decreases.  What this means is that with a constant current
driver, the output will increase as well.  However, the limiting factor before
the LD changes into a DELD may still be Catastrophic Optical Damage (COD) and
its onset will depend on the E/M field interaction at the output facet,
something not affected very much by ambient temperature.  So, your 5 mW LD
may still be limited to 5 mW even if it is more efficient at low temperature.
<p>
<blockquote>
"I have read that cooling semiconductor laser diodes shortens wavelength and
 greatly increases efficiency some.  Does this apply to the 635 nm diodes and
 what would be the result of super cooling one of these diodes?"
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Fred Kung (kung@ccf.nrl.navy.mil).)
<p>
One thing you will need to be careful about is that in super cooling a
compound semiconductor diode laser, you will eventually take it out of its
range of lasing operation (due to dispersion shifting).  Dropping the
temperature to -50 &deg;C or so is OK, but don't expect them to work in LN2 or
anything very cold unless they're designed for that.
<p>
The 0.3 nm/&deg;C figure is good for GaAs quantum well lasers with AlGaAs
cladding (which covers most of the commercially available ones), but only
around room temperature.
<p>
One other thing that may happen if you cool the diode too far is that the
thermal mismatch with the epoxy will cause it to physically come loose from
its mount.  Again, a TE cooler is fine, but don't dump cryogens on the thing.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
As diode temperature goes down, so does the level of the damage
threshold.
<p>
A friend who makes his living selling OEM laser display systems did
some tests a while back, massive amounts of Peltier cooling (30 to 40 &deg;C)
results in a much lower current for the destructive failure of the
diode, He was blowing off the front faucets of the diodes at less then
normal operating currents.   So yes you can shorten the wavelength
somewhat, but you have to test carefully and derate the max current.
Derating the current means less output power, so you probably want to
start with a 40 mW or bigger diode. Basically the intracavity
flux goes way up and often the faucet can't take the increased power
density.

<h3><A NAME="dioldl9">Comments on Pulsing of Common Laser Diodes</A>

(Portions from: Roithner Lasertechnik" (office@roithner-laser.com).)
<p>
We did some experiments to see whether the types of laser diodes found
in red laser pointers could be pulsed without damage.  It seems that
depending on the type of laser diode, pulsed operation in the nanosecond
range may be possible.
<p>
A microsecond is much to long for CW diodes, but you can try 10 to 50 ns.
This can work, but it still depends on the laser diode. We performed
experiments with low cost 5 mW, 650 nm CW laser diodes (red laserpointer)
with 50 ns, 3 A, 1 kHz, and the LDs worked without pain (no degradation) for
months. 100 to 200 ns seems to be the critical pulse length. Also the
effective emitting aperture size is important, a 400 mW LD may have a
typical 100 um aperture - compared to a red pointer diode of typical 3 to 5 um.
The power density mW/aperture size is the most critical value, normally you
cannot go much higher than 10MW/cm<sup>2</sup> to 30MW/cm<sup>2</sup> (Megawatt).
Higher power density at the outcoupling facet means sublimation of "mirror"
material. But don't worry, worst case you have made a EELED...
<p>
We made a fast and dirty setup and did not care much about power linearity
by drive current. But laser power was more or less linear and proportional
with increasing pulse current - surely running over some kinks, but this did
not matter in this case. Also some LDs "gave up" catastrophic - as
expected(!!!) - at much lower pulse currents in the 100..200 mA region.
<p>
We applied current pulses (fp~10..100 Hz) up to 6 A, typ. 50 ns, but
recognized a fast degradation and EELED metamorphosis within few minutes to
hours of running.
<p>
These LDs had PDs inside, TO-18 with window, driver circuit was APC type. But COB
(Chip On Board, bare chip) LD with 50 Ohms "driver" may also work...
<p>
The big surprise for me finally was to get out "extremely high power laser
pulses" from a lowest cost red pointer laser diode. Even if you pulse such a
LD at "snugly" 500 mA the pulse power is very high compared to a typical 5 mW
to 50 mA CW current. One last thing: Normally you cannot predict if a CW LD "test
candidate" will survive - it's a real game of trial and error...

<h2>Laser Diode Wavelengths, Spectra and Visibility of NIR Laser Diodes</h2>
<h3><A NAME="diovon0">Wavelengths of Diode Lasers</A></h3>

The first direct injection laser diodes (i.e., electrically pumped monolithic
semiconductors), developed in the 1960s at the beginning of the Laser Age, were
pulsed deviced emitting at near-IR wavelengths (and possibly only with
cryogenic cooling), around 750 to 800 nm.  As the technology has matured, room
temperature CW laser diodes have become readily available and the range of
wavelengths has expanded to include visible red (670 nm), orange-red (635
to 650 nm), and pushed further into the IR (up to about 2 um).  Most of these
are based on various compounds containing gallium and arsenic.  To get an
idea of the wavelengths and output powers available commercially, see:
<A HREF="http://www.k3pgp.org/ldspecs.htm">K3PGP's
Laser Diode Specifications</A> maintained by K3PGP (Email: k3pgp@qsl.net).
<p>
The use of laser diodes in all sorts of mass produced products (CD, LD, MD,
DVD, laser printers, bar code scanners, telecommunications, etc.) has driven
down prices for lower power devices, at least.
<p>
However, shorter wavelength laser diodes had eluded researchers for many years.
(The current crop of green laser pointers are DPSSFD lasers.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers</A>.  Relatively
recently, Nichia Chemical</A> has started sampling and is about to begin commercial production
of violet (400 nm, they actually call them blue) laser diodes based on gallium
nitride.  See  <A HREF="http://www.nichia.co.jp/product/laser.html">Nichia Blue/Violet
Laser Diodes</A>.  Other companies including <A HREF="http://www.xerox.com/">Xerox
Corporation</A> have their own blue laser diodes near commercialization.  Also
see the section: <A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#dioabg">Availability of Green, Blue,
and Violet Laser Diodes</A>.
<p>
Mid-IR (3 to 25 um) types are also available.  These typically use
lead salts for the active material, but may require a frigid operating
environment while producing only around 100 uW output power.  You won't find
such devices in consumer electronics - their applications are more likely to
be in spectroscopy research. (check out:
<A HREF="http://lasercomponents.com/">Laser Components GmbH</A>).
<p>
(Portions from: Anthony Cook (a.l.cook@larc.nasa.gov).)
<p>
The latest development in far-IR (greater than 3 um) laser diodes is the
Quantum Cascade Laser which can produce 100s of mW of light at room temperature
and up to a watt or more when cooled to about -100 &deg;F (-73 &deg;C).  These
operate in the range of 3 to 13 um.  They are not commercially available yet
(I don't think) but several research groups are doing work in this area:

<h3><A NAME="diovon1">Spectra of Visible and IR Laser Diodes</A></h3>

(From: Don Klipstein (Don@Misty.com).)
<p>
Some nominally IR wavelengths are indeed very slightly visible.  In favorable
conditions (mainly isolating from more visible wavelengths) I have seen with
my own eyes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The 766.49/769.9 nM potassium lines, as a contaminant in high pressure
 sodium lamps.
<p>
<li>The 818.3/819.5 nM sodium lines in the spectra of high pressure sodium
 lamps.
<p>
<li>The 762.1, 759.4, and 822.85 nM earth atmospheric absorption lines in the
 solar spectrum.  (Usually with the sun somewhat low.)
<p>
<li>The output of a laser diode in my CD player is visible at eye-safe
 intensities (half a meter from a source with a beam covering nearly a 
 steradian for a few seconds).  I have seen the spectrum of this along with
 that of a neon lamp placed next to it, and verified that what I saw was
 the laser line, with a wavelength around 800 nM.  It could be as low as
 around 780 nM.
</ol>
<p>
According to the C.I.E. "Y" or visibility function (or extrapolation thereof),
the visibility of these lines is impressively low.  However, considering the
wide dynamic range of the human eye, these wavelengths are visible at eye-safe
levels.
<p>
CAUTION: there is no advance warning of having exceeded eye-safe exposure to
slightly visible wavelengths normally considered IR.  You may permanently
toast part of your retinas duplicating the above unless you verify retinal
exposure below the Class I laser exposure limit.
<p>
I recently got a laser pointer with a wavelength of 660-661 nm or so and
(guesstimated) 2 mW of output power.
<p>
I discovered that if I shine the beam through one of those dielectric
interference bandpass filters, I got some weak beam output at other
wavelengths.  So, I investigated further.
<p>
About (very roughly estimated from standard issue eyeballs) .2 percent of the
beam is spurious radiation with a continuous spectrum.  I don't yet know well
what it does at longer wavelengths, but a majority of the short wavelength
side of this is in the few tens of nm below 660 nm.  Slight traces exist down
to 540 nm.  With two 532 nm filters, I could stare into the beam and see a dim
point of light.  With a 570 nm filter, it was slightly bright to stare into
and I could see the beam VERY DIMLY on a wall in a dark room.  With a filter
around 630 nm, I could easily see the beam on a wall in a dark room.  I used
my diffraction grating to verify that most of this was continuous spectrum in
the passband of the filter.
<p>
The spurious radiation takes the same path that the laser radiation does.
<p>
With no filter, I could not see any continuous spectrum with my diffraction
grating.  The laser line was so much stronger.
<p>
As for IR lasers?  If the spectrum is just a long-shifted version of what my
visible laser does, the most visible part of the laser output would be the
laser line.  Having a wavelength 100 nm closer to visible increases its
visibility only by about a factor of 1,000 and the total spurious output was
(roughly) 1/1,000 of the laser line output.  The wavelength of the bulk of
this was nowhere near 100 nm shorter.
<p>
Although I can't be sure this would always be the case, the only spectrum
components I could see using a diffraction grating with my CD player
laser was the laser line at about 800 nm.
<p>
I suspect different IR laser diodes may have greatly different ratios of laser
and LED output.  If the LED output is only a fraction of a percent of the laser
output, the visible output would be mainly the slightly visible laser line.  If
the LED output is equal to a few percent or more of the laser output, then it
may be more visible than the laser line.

<h3><A NAME="diovon2">Visibility of Near-IR (NIR) Laser Diodes</A></h3>

Here are a variety of comments on whether light perceived as originating from
near-IR laser diodes - those with wavelengths shorter than about 1,000 nm -
is actually due to the actual lasing line or just the much broader spontaneous
(LED) emission.  For some types of laser diodes, it may be a combination.
But various experiments are described below with Ti:Sapphire and dye lasers
that show clear visibility of near-IR wavelengths beyond 800 nm.
<p>
The simplest test would be to use a diffraction grating to both view the
spectrum and detect it with a silicon photodiode.  If the maximum detected
matches the location of the most visible spot, then you're seening the
lasing line.  If the visible spectrum is smeared out or too faint to see
but there is a well defined detected spot, then it's LED emission.
<p>
I tested a 780 nm diode laser module in this manner and the results
were quite clear: The IR and visible spots lined up precisely so in
the case of this module at least, what you're seeing IS the IR lasing
line.
<p>
(From: Kjell Kraakenes (kkraaken@telepost.no).)
<p>
I once used 780 nm laser diodes similar to the types used in CD players, and
something that puzzled me was that I was able to see some red radiation from
these diodes.  I used a microscope objective to focus the light on a wall a
few meters away, and when properly focused, a red spot was visible to the
naked eye.  I had a piece of black card board on the wall, and there was no
specular reflection.  I used an IR viewer of the type sold by Edmund
Scientific (Find-R-Scope), and if I looked at the spot with this IR viewer
the beam appeared defocused.  By adjusting the distance between the laser diode
and the microscope objective, the spot (as it appeared through the IR viewer)
could be brought to a better focus. The red, visible light was then so much
defocused that it was no longer visible to the naked eye.  From these
observations, I assumed that the spot I saw through the IR viewer was the
laser emission at 780 nm, and that the visible light was some weak emission
at a shorter wavelength.  Because of the chromatic aberrations in the
microscope objective these two wavelength could not be expected to be in focus
simultaneously.  I did not notice whether the distance between the laser diode
and the microscope objective was increased or decreased when shifting between
the focus of the visible and the IR light, but since I did not know the
chromatic aberrations of the microscope objective this information would not
help me.
<p>
I damaged a few of these laser diodes.  Probably by burning one of the facets
such that the lasing threshold was increased.  Electrically they were OK, and
the visible output appeared as intense as before, but the total output was
only a few microwatts.
<p>
I therefore believe that the light people see from NIR laser diodes is
spurious emission within the visible band, and not intense NIR radiation.
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (Don@Misty.com).)
<p>
According to the official 'standard observer' photopic response of the human
eye, the long wave cutoff is a gradual one.  Sensitivity roughly halves for
each 10 nm further into the infrared.  This trend holds close to true enough
'officially' from 700 to at least 780 nm.
<p>
It seems as if a small spot is usually (maybe only barely) visible to
dark-adapted eyes in a dark room with eye-safe levels of any wavelength up
to around 880 to 900 nm, maybe 950 nm for brief viewing.  (If your eye's long
wave sensitivity is not below average!)
<p>
But you may not want to push your luck.  A milliwatt of IR can permanently
cook a spot of your retina, maybe within a couple seconds, and with no pain or
warning.  Prolonged focusing of any quantity of light over 0.4 microwatt onto a
single point on the retina is potentially damaging, although several
microwatts won't do damage in only seconds.
<p>
Be careful if the main beam of the IR laser diode is collimated or not known
to not be collimated.  Some IR laser diodes have visible spurious emission,
which may detract you from the main beam.  In some other IR laser diodes and
depending on your eyes, most of what you find visible is the main IR
wavelength and you may be exposing your eyes to plenty of it if you find it
visible.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I wonder about this.  We use 1 W+ laser diodes at 808, 814, and 980 nm
routinely while monitoring on an optical spectrum analyzer.  While we don't
usually search for shorter wavelengths from the diode, we do occasionally
scan for other wavelengths and have never seen any that would explain the red
emission other than the fundamental of the diode.  808 nm and 814 nm are
faintly visible; 980 nm is totally invisible.  I have even seen very very faint
red-appearing light from high power 870 nm laser diodes for which the optical
spectrum was known and very local to 870 mn.  Thus, it must be that this
wavelength that is actually still visible.  Your mileage will vary and
depend on the model and revision level of your set of eyeballs.  Consult
factory for more information.  Have model and serial number available. :)
<p>
(From: Professor Harvey Rutt (h.rutt@ecs.soton.ac.uk).)
<p>
I don't know what the dynamic range of your spectrum analyzer is - and
I'm sure the sidebands vary greatly from diode structure to structure.
We have seen large wings on both sides of 780 to 810 nm diodes, sometimes
very structured, sometimes broad and featureless. One 1.48 W diode was
emitting astonishing amounts at 1.9 to 2 um for example.  For a 1 W
diode, say 10<sup>-9</sup> or -90dB or 1 nW would be easily visible to the
dark adapted eye and if it's in the 600 nm-odd region (where we have seen
emission) it's that you will be seeing not the 1 W of 800-odd nm.  The
emission can be very broad, which your eye integrates up but an
analyzer sees as a very flat signal just above noise; remember that
for good dark adaption and narrow electrical bandwidths your eye is not
*that* much worse than a PMT!  Incidentally, since the photon has to
cause photochemistry in the eye to get detected, I rather suspect that
the drop in sensitivity with wavelength may well steepen. For example
in my less careful youth I've looked at MW class 1.06 um lasers hitting
things and never seen anything at all unless there is a plasma flash.
<p>
(From: Johannes Swartling (j_swartling@hotmail.com).)
<p>
I have an external cavity-stabilized diode at 785 nm in the lab, with a
band-pass filter to remove unwanted sidebands. It is clearly visible, and
there is definitely no stray light at shorter wavelengths.
<p>
In another lab there's a Ti:Sapphire laser running at 790 nm, and that is also
visible, even when it's running CW (narrow bandwidth).
<p>
(From: Harvey.)
<p>
Probably the best data I've seen that you can really see it but *certainly* in
many cases it is stray shorter wavelength from diodes, we have measured it. For
1 W class sources a 10<sup>-9</sup> level sideband can easily be the cause of
the visibility, especially as the eye integrates up broad band featureless mess
that spec. analyzers easily miss. Its easy to say definitely narrow band. but
what is the bandwidth at the -80, -90dB level? For the Ti:S I guess you
can be pretty sure though - I don't recall how short the fluorescence can go.
<p>
However I would still maintain it is very unwise indeed to try. Your eye
sensitivity is down 5, 6 orders of magnitude on peak, it will look dim, but the
potential for eye damage is horrendous - & I'm not a safety 'freak'. Certainly,
to see it, you would have to blow massive holes through laser safety rules!
<p>
(From: Josh Halpern (theherd@erols.com).)
<p>
What is often missing from these discussions is that there is a fair amount
of variation among people as to how far in the red/blue they can see.
Dye lasers are good tests of this.  I can see down to about 380 nm  and
also out to about 820 nm.  Some people crap out at a little below
400 nm and a little above 780 nm.  I know one person who can see down
to 370 nm and well above 840 nm, but he is very unusual.
<p>
(From: Roithner Lasertechnik (office@roithner-laser.com).)
<p>
2 wavelengths out of one laser diode chip: Yes, it's possible.
<p>
Some months ago we receiveed a batch of 980 nm laser diodes (modules) with
light emission at two wavelengths: One as expected at 980 nm (50 mW) and
another very low power emission at around 670 nm (few 10 uW).
<p>
You must see it to believe it, but out of one laser diode chip there can be
red light and infrared light, that's fact.

<h3><A NAME="diovon3">Spectral Width Measurements of Diode Lasers</A></h3>

The comments below where in response to the following question:

<blockquote>
"The spectrum of this laser diode (Sanyo) is supposed to be quite narrow (about
 3 or 4 nm) in the range 635 to 645nm.  But when I have tested that diode, I
 have found that it emits light from 635 nm up to 660 nm!!!  So the width of
 its spectrum is more than 20 nm!"
</blockquote>

(From: Mark Summerfield (m.summerfield@ieee.org).)
<p>
Could you give some more details of your measurement?

<ol>
<li>How did you make the measurement - i.e., with what instrument(s)?
<li>What were the bias conditions of the laser diode (preferably
 expressed relative to the threshold current)?
<li>What, exactly, were the results?
</ol>

These questions should enable us to account for the three most obvious
possibilities:

<ol>
<li>That your measurement was inaccurate and/or misleading.
<li>That you were not observing lasing at all.
<li>That you do not fully understand what the manufacturer means
 when they specify the spectral width.
</ol>

In each case, the explanation may be:

<ol>
<li>The measurement must be of sufficiently narrow resolution that when you
 observe the power at, say, 660nm, you are not observing significant "leakage"
 of light from the main lasing mode at around 635 nm.
<p>
<li>If the diode is not biased (sufficiently far) above threshold, you will
 see a very broad spectrum including all the cavity modes within the
 semiconductor gain bandwidth (typically many tens of nanometers).  Only when
 the device is lasing will a small number of dominant modes appear.
<p>
<li>Spectral width is normally specified as "full-width half maximum", i.e.
 the difference (in nanometers) between two points in the spectrum where the
 power is one half of the peak power.  On a sufficiently sensitive instrument
 (e.g., an optical spectrum analyzer with the display set to logarithmic
 scale), you will see power over a much wider bandwidth than this.  However,
 it remains true that "most" of the output power lies within the specified
 bandwidth.
</ol>

One final possibility is that the diode is faulty, damaged, or does not
otherwise meet spec.  However, if you are inexperienced in the use and
characterization of laser diodes, we must eliminate all the above 
possibilities first.
<p>
(From: Harvey Rutt (h.rutt@ecs.soton.ac.uk).)
<p>
Most laser diodes emit a broad background of spontaneous emission as well as
the laser output.
<p>
A student of mine made another error a while back.  He simply had the gain on
the detection system turned up too high; the very narrow laser line was
heavily saturating the system, and he saw those big broad wings.
<p>
Which incidentally can extend extraordinary distances and have all sorts of
structure. One of our 810nm diodes puts out a load of broad band mess out near
2,000 nm (yes, 2 um!) but virtually nothing in the 1 to 1.8 um region.

<h3><A NAME="dioled0">Wavelengths of Common LEDs</A></h3>

(From Don Klipstein (don@Misty.com).)
<p>
Ordinary LEDs have peak wavelengths and dominant wavelengths:
<p>
The dominant wavelength is the wavelength (mixed with white if necessary) that
matches the color of the light source in question.  The white, if not
specified, is usually C.I.E. Standard Illuminant C which is approx. 6500
Kelvin.  C.I.E. Illuminant E, which has chromaticity of (.3333, .3333) and is
very slightly purpler than approx. 5500 Kelvin, may also be used.  Most LEDs
are either close enough to matching a spectral color or on a blue-yellow line
that most whites are close to that it is not really necessary to specify the
white.
<p>
But here are the peak wavelengths, dominant wavelengths, and approximate
limunous efficacies (lumens in each watt out, not lumens per watt in that
I mention in <A HREF="http://www.misty.com/~don/led.html">The Brightest and
Most Efficient LEDs and Where to Get Them!</A> for various LEDs.  The luminous
efficacy of 555 nm is approx. 681 lumens per watt.
<p>
Please note that I have misplaced some Hewlett Packard LED datasheets
which contain most of the luminous efficacy data that I had on hand.  I
may be able to recover some from Hewlett Packard's web sites and refine
this later.

<h3><A NAME="dioleds">Spectrum of LEDs</A></h3>

Basically, there is no contest.  The emission spectra of an LED is much broader
than that of a laser diode.  While a typical laser diode will have a
spectrum of 2 or 3 nm (FWHM), that of a typical LED may be 50 nm or more.
This is one of the main reasons that super high power LEDs aren't really
useful for pumping of solid state lasers (the others have to do with
the large emitting area, lower efficiency, and cost).
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (don@misty.com).)
<p>
The typical spectral width (FWHM) is about 20 nm for narrower visible ones
such as InGaAlP and InGaN.  Some visible ones are broader - about 70 nm for
broader bandwidth blue and low current red.
<p>
Infrared GaAlAs with peak wavelength 880 nm seems to usually have a bandwidth
of 80 nm, at least if made by OSRAM Opto Semiconductors (formerly Infineon).

<h3><A NAME="dioledh">High Power LEDs</A></h3>

Most conventional LEDs produce a few mW with a few as high as 10 to 15 mW.
However, there are some truly high power LEDs:
<p>
(From: Lou Boyd (boyd@apt2.sao.arizona.edu).)
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.optodiode.com/">Opto Diode Corporation</A> offers the
OD-100, TO-39 single diode which is rated is rated at 80 mW minimum, 100 mW
typical continuous output at 500 mA.  Their OD-669 T066 is an array of 9
diodes and produces 390 mW minimum, 1/2 watt typical at 300 mA (13.5 volts).
Both are 880 nm.  They cost about $9 and $60 respectively but there's a
minimum order.

<h3><A NAME="diolede">Efficiency of LEDs</A></h3>

Commercially available high power laser diodes can have overall conversion
efficiencies of 45% to 50% and research is underway to boost this to a
staggering 80%!  How do LED compare?
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (Don@Misty.com).)
<p>
The "Overall luminous efficacy" (lumens out per watt in) is the conversion 
efficiency (watts out per watt in) times the "luminous efficacy of the 
emitted light", and that is 683 (used to be 681) times the photopic 
function of the emitted light.  Photopic function overall is a "weighted 
average" of the photopic function of every wavelength (or narrow slice of 
the spectrum), weighted by the amount of optical output at each wavelength 
or in each little slice of the spectrum.
<p>
The most efficient (conversion efficiency) visible LEDs to my knowledge 
are Lumileds "Luxeon" red ones with truncated inverted pyramid dice.  At 
full power, they typically achieve 42 lumens per watt in.  The luminous 
efficacy of the emitted light (lumens out per watt out) is around 160 
lumens/watt, maybe a little more.  This means the conversion efficiency 
(watts out per watt in) is around 25%.
<p>
Lumileds red, orange and yellow LEDs are most efficient when slightly to 
moderately underpowered.  Their red ones may get 28% to 29% efficiency at half 
power.
<p>
The best of other red LEDs get around 18% to 20% conversion efficiency.
<p>
The highest conversion efficiency that I have heard of so far for a 
non-laser LED is for red GaP, or GaP doped with ZnO, and the figure that I 
heard was 30%.
<p>
This is at low currents, maybe around or possibly under half a milliamp 
for the usual ones with maximum rated current of 30 mA.  These are 
noticeably nonlinear with efficiency peaking near or maybe under half a 
milliamp.  They are so nonlinear in favor of low currents that they are 
sometimes referred to as "low current red" and most "low current red" LEDs 
are these.  Ones in non-tinted packages often glow orangish or sometimes 
even yellowish orange at currents that they operate safely at - a 
secondary spectral band in the yellowish green does not lose efficiency at 
higher currents the way the main red band does.  These LEDs are 
distinguished by a nominal peak wavelength of 690 to 700 nm.
<p>
For examples - look in a <A HREF="http://www.digikey.com/">Digikey</A>
catalog for Panasonic red LEDs with a peak wavelength around 700 nm.
<p>
Conversion efficiency of some other LEDs - APPROXIMATE and GIVE_OR_TAKE 
SOMEWHAT - at the current that the LEDs are characterized at (20 mA or 2/3 
maximum current usually, except maximum current for Lumileds "Luxeons" while 
the chip is at 25 &deg;C - HAHAHA!!!).
<p>
Here are numbers for some specific manufacturers:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Nichia blue: 10% to 11.5%.
<li>Nichia blue-green: ~9%.
<li>Nichia green: 7% to 9%.
<li>Nichia white: 8% to 9%.
<p>
<li>Lumileds blue - 11% to 12%.
<li>Lumileds cyan - ~9%.
<li>Lumileds green - ~5% to 6%.
<li>Lumileds white - 9% to 10%.
<p>
(Nichia LEDs can be ~20% higher at 20% to 25% of characterized current)
<p>
<li>Lumileds yellow with T.I.P. dice: ~7%.
<li>Best other yellows: ~4% to 5%.
<p>
<li>Lumileds orange with T.I.P. dice: ~19 to 20%.
<li>Best other oranges: ~10% to 15%.
<p>
<li>GaAlAsP "660 nm peak ultrabright" red: ~10, sometimes 11%.
<p>
<li>Best yellow-green: ~1.3%.
</ul>
<p>
(Lumileds has slight improvement at slight to moderate underpowering, 
other red to yellow-green usually has close to maximum efficiency at 
characterized current.)

<h3><A NAME="dioledm">Measuring Efficiency of LEDs</A></h3>

(From: Don Klipstein (don@Misty.com).)
<p>
Get the black "satellite grade" solar cell, such as Radio Shack 276-124
(version at least A).  There are soldering surfaces on the top and bottom
along one of the long edges.  There may be oxide on those surfaces, so clean
these surfaces very gently with very fine sandpaper or preferably fine steel
wool.  Maybe place the cell on a flat surface while scrubbing it, since it is
about as fragile as a piece of glass of the same dimensions.  Then solder a
pair of wires onto it, preferably 26-30 gauge.  Solder
quickly to avoid cooking the silicon.
<p>
Connect the solar cell to a milliammeter.  Shine the LED on it, with known
current flowing through the LED.  Make a small white paper cone to get the
side and rear light (although there is usually not much from most LEDs) on to
the cell.  Do this in a reasonably dark room but with some illumination on the
solar cell meter.  Move the LED and the white paper cone around for the
highest reading.  Note that the solar cell can scratch LEDs which will mar
clear ones.
<p>
Multiply the solar cell current by 1.04 to approximately correct for the
little silvery strips on the solar cell blocking light from it.
<p>
Divide the (multiplied by 1.04) solar cell current by the LED current - this
will be the photon/electron ratio.  Give or take a few to maybe several
percent. :)
<p>
Note that the solar cell will read low with blue LEDs, probably a little
low with blue-green ones, and definitely a little low with white ones.
The blue solar cells are not as good as the black ones - the blue ones are
only reasonably accurate from yellow to near IR, while the black ones are
good from mid-green through near-IR.
<p>
Amorphous silicon solar cells, selenium solar cells and flexible solar
cells will not work as well as single crystal silicon ones.
<p>
I have gotten figures that don't run low compared to figures claimed by
LED manufacturers, so I know this method is reasonably accurate.
<p>
With many LEDs, the photon/electron ratio is close enough to the efficiency.
To refine this figure, multiply it by the "electron volt" photon energy, which
is 1240 divided by the wavelength in nanometers.  The peak wavelength is close
enough to valid for most LEDs.  Then divide this by the voltage drop of the
LED in volts.
<p>
If you want a luminous efficacy figure in lumens per watt, many LED
manufacturers publish such figures for the emitted light.  If your LED
does not have a figure for the efficacy of the emitted light, it is
normally close enough to that of other LEDs of the same peak wavelength,
bandwidth, and basic chemistry.  Multiply the manufacturer's figure by the
LED's conversion efficiency to get the overall luminous efficacy, in lumens
of light per watt of electricity.

<h3><A NAME="dioled2">Super Bright LEDs Versus Laser Diodes</A></h3>

There are now LEDs in virtually all colors that have higher output power than
your typical small laser diode.  However, they are still incoherent and have
a large emitting area.  Therefore, they are not generally suitable as
replacements for laser diodes in many applications.  However, where the need
is for a bright light source, LEDs may be superior to laser diodes because they
don't suffer from speckle or other interference effects.
<p>
CAUTION: While not generally on par with laser diodes in the danger area,
these super bright LEDs must still be treated with respect especially if
collimated or assembled into multiple LED arrays.

<h3><A NAME="dioled3">Why Can an LED Not be Focused Like a Laser
 Diode?</A></h3>

The cheap laser diode from a CD player can be focused to a spot less than
2 um in diameter.  A $5 laser pointer can project a spot a few mm in diameter
several meters away.  Why is this not possible with an LED?
<p>
The quick answer is that an LED does not appear as a point source and has
as effective emitting area which is huge compared to a laser diode.  Even
though the emitting area of a laser diode is not a point, due to the way the
laser beam is generated - collimation wise - it appears as a point source.
<p>
And, a point source can be focused to another point or collimated easily.
<p>
The effective emitting area of an LED is perhaps .25 x .25 mm.  To focus
an incoherent source like this to a 2 um spot with imaging optics would
require a ratio of distances of roughly 125:1 for the LED-to-lens compared
to the lens-to-image plane.
<p>
With only simple optics (e.g., a positive lens), you will get a vanishingly
small amount of power at the image plane.  Similarly, an LED beam cannot be
cleaned up with a spatial filter (pinhole) as very little of the beam will
make it through.
<p>
The laser diode is coherent and monochromatic (enough) that relatively simple
optics can be used to focus it to a spot smaller than 2 um.  While the
dimensions of the laser diode chip are not all that much different from the
LED, the characteristics of the laser emission makes such focusing a
relatively easy task.
<p>
Consider that the beam from a HeNe or ruby laser doesn't come from point
source either.  The beam can be sharply focussed because it is very well
collimated.
<p>
The availability of relatively inexpensive laser diodes really was the enabling
technology for the CD revolution - and for the glut of cheap laser pointers!
<p>
To construct an "LED pointer" with the simple optics that are adequate in a
laser pointer isn't practical.  With that effective emitting area of an LED of
around .25 x .25 mm, geometric optics tells us that to project a spot 10 mm
in diameter 10 meters away with a positive lens, the ratio of distances from
the diode to the lens and from the lens to the screen would have to be about
1:40 so the lens would have to be about 25 cm (8 inches) from the LED.  At
that distance, any reasonable diameter (and affordable) lens would intercept
a very small portion of the emission of the LED.  There are ways around this
using more complex optics that compress a long effective focal length into
a compact package.  Putting a negative lens close to the LED followed by
a larger positive lens would do this, as would a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope.
Even if the spot size requirement is met, I don't know how much of the LED's
output would be used by an affordable system.  Although there have been
somewhat bulky (e.g., 1.5 foot long) pointers based on incandescent lamps,
I don't know if LED pointers have ever been produced for presentation
purposes.  However, <A HREF="http://www.roithner-laser.com/">Roithner
Lasertechnik</A> does list LED pointers but the lowest divergence is
10 degrees (about 170 mR) which isn't quite as good as a decent flashlight!
<p>
One interesting side note: burnt out laser diodes - i.e., those that still
work as LEDs but do not lase - can be focused or collimated nicely.  Not quite
like a true laser diode, but much better than an LED since the emitting area
is still very small - typically 1 um by a few um for a low power laser diode.
Of course, the maximum optical power output of these blown devices is also
quite small. :-(
<p>
(From: Steve Nosko (q10706@email.mot.com).)
<p>
If a beam of light has nothing but *precisely* parallel rays, it can be
focused to a point. Also, if the beam originated from a point, a lens will
focus it to a point.
<p>
An LED has neither of these.  First, it is an area source and light coming
from that surface is not parallel.  It would also be called a diffuse source,
meaning light from all places on the surface travels in many directions.  This
kind of source can not be focused to anything but a smaller image of itself.
The shorter the focal length of the lens, the smaller the image - but it is
still an image of the source, not a spot.  It is because of these rays,
traveling in different directions, that a lens can't focus them all to the
same point.  If you draw the side view of a lens and trace rays this all
should be obvious.
<p>
The gas laser, on the other hand, has rays which are much much closer to being
parallel.  The diode laser has rays which appear to come from an apparent point
inside the diode.
<p>
There are two more subtle effects.  One effect is the relatively wide range of
wavelengths in the LED versus the narrow range of a laser.  Simple optics don't
focus all wavelengths at the same focal length.  So the wide bandwidth of the
LED causes a little trouble.  There is another effect having to do with the
size of the lens (diffraction limit) and the wavelength, but this is also
secondary to an understanding of the *primary* reason why an LED can't be
focused.
<p>
(From: Dave Martindale (davem@cs.ubc.ca).)
<p>
A commercially-made Schmidt-Cassegrain or Maksutov telescope could project
a small spot from an LED at a considerable distance.  These both use a fairly
fast (low f/number) primary mirror and a diverging (negative focal length)
secondary mirror to give the net effect of a long focal length slow (f/10 to
f/12) optical system.  I have a 4 inch diameter SCT with 1.2 m focal length;
the 8 inch SCTs are generally 2 m focal length.  A 4 inch SCT is pretty small
and light weight; 4 inches diameter, maybe a foot long, and a few pounds.
<p>
And that's just the primary mirror.  A telescope and eyepiece are nominally
an "afocal" system, with parallel incoming rays exiting parallel from
the eyepiece.  But, in fact, most telescopes have enough focuser travel
to focus the image somewhere out behind the eyepiece.  You can put a
camera body loaded with film in that location and you get "eyepiece
projection" photography.  The effective focal length of such setups
can be enormous - yet it uses nothing more than a standard telescope
and eyepiece.
<p>
So, how plausible is "a few mm diameter at several hundred yards"?
Well, the resolution limit (from diffraction) of a 4 inch diameter
telescope is about 1 arc-second.  One arc-second is the size of an object
1 mm across at 200 m.  So with a well-collimated *laser* source and
perfect focus and alignment and no air turbulence, you should be
able to produce a spot only a few mm in size at 200 yards.
<p>
Without a laser, it depends on magnification.  One way of looking at
it: with eyepiece projection, using a short enough focal length
eyepiece, can you get the image of something 5 mm in size at 200 yards
(5 arc seconds) to be perhaps 1 mm in diameter on the film?  Without
doing the calculations, I'll bet you can.  And if you can, then the
path can be operated in reverse: substitute a LED die for the film
at the focal plane, and if the LED die is less than 1 mm across, then
the in-focus image of it 200 yards away will be under 5 mm.

The only decent simulated "laser" that used an LED (that I'm currently aware
of!) was sold by <A HREF="http://www.amazing1.com/">Information Unlimited</A>
in the early 1980s.  It used a Fairchild FLV-104 LED (I *finally* got my hands
on one of these last week) and consisted of a 12" long telescoping metal tube,
a long focal length lens, the special LED, and a circuit that fed high current
pulses to it. The pulse rep rate could be varied by a pot on the butt end. 
<p>
When the device (in kit form) was constructed properly, it emitted bright
flashes of red light that were remarkably well collimated and could be
seen on a surface 300 feet or more away. 
<p>
Some very limited info about this "laser LED" can be found at
<A HREF="http://ledmuseum.home.att.net/1980.htm">1980-1989: LEDs Brighten

love to get my hands on one at least for the sake of my Web site.

(From: devnull@angelfire.com.)
<p>
Actually, I've gotten excellent collimation off the standard
high-lumen turquoise LED (21k lumens), the divergence angle is
actually much less than say the TEC cooled 500 mW Polaroid laser diodes.
Mine was from a Photon Light, only the turquoise one works, the rest don't
have proper uniformity/divergence. I believe you can buy the raw LEDs for
$2 to $3.
<p>
Using a couple of 0.5" diameter tech-spec lenses and a 10" dia. solid
glass photocopy lens, I read about 2 mW of output power off the
collimated LED beam, which is pencil thin at the aperture and grows to
about 2" diameter at 20 yards. I had to laugh as I have some real
lasers which don't have that nice of collimation.
<p>
If you want proof of concept, just grab 2 convex lenses and collimate
the beam. I tested the idea out with 2 - ~4" magnifying lenses I had
lying around. The rather amazing results led me to hunt for the
perfect LED collimation.
<p>
I can get the beam waist at output to be needle-then, but the best
collimation I can get is with a slightly larger output diameter. This
is probably due to the first large lens which I'm using to capture
most of the light.

<h3><A NAME="dioled4">Vision Safety Comparison of Laser Diode, LED, and Light
 Bulb</A></h3>

As LEDs with higher and higher outputs are being developed, there is natural
concern (or should be) that they could also prove to be a hazard to vision.
At some power level, this will no doubt be a valid concern.  However, when
evaluating the risks from laser diodes and LEDs of similar power output, there
really is no comparison:
<p>
The intensity of a light source can be loosely defined as the optical power
divided by the area of the source divided by the solid angle of emission. An
LED and a laser diode with the same power output which both happen to emit
light over the same angle still differ in emitter area - by a huge amount.
<p>
Note that for wavelengths that pass through the cornea, lens, and vitreous of
the eye to be focused on the retina, it is optical power that matters
regardless of how bright any given wavelength may appear.  Thus, 5 mW of 555
nm green light (to which the eye is most sensitive) has about the same damage
potential as 5 mW of 780 nm IR (which is nearly invisible) in terms of how
much heat will be delivered to a spot on the retina.  However, the 780 nm IR,
being nearly invisible, will not trigger blink reflexes and aversion responses
so it is in fact much more dangerous.  For more info, see the section:
<A HREF="laserfaq_ru.htm#faqsaf">Лазерная безопасность</A> and
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diocss4">Техника безопасности диодных лазероы</A>.)
<p>
A typical laser diode is diffraction limited with an emitting area of about
1 um by 3 um.  An LED will emit from the surface of its chip over a full
hemisphere.  In order to radiate over only a limited angle, a lens is added
but with idea optics, the emitting area is still effectively the .3 mm x .3 mm
or so area of the LED.  This is about 30,000 times that of the laser diode.
With the typical 5 mm molded lens, it is more like 1,000,000 times the area.
That means the intensity and optical density of the laser diode can be over a
million times that of the LED.
<p>
When the light from either device hits your eye you will not likely have any
problems because your (at most) 7 mm diameter pupil will intercept very little
of the light if you are several inches from the source.
<p>
The light from the lensed LED starts out 5 mm diameter at the lens and expands
rapidly until it hits the eye.  The amount of light entering your eye a couple
of inches away is very small.
<p>
Even if you push the LED up against your cornea you cannot focus on anything
that close to your eye even if you are extremely nearsighted.  So the image of
the very close LED that forms on the retina is blurred.  That means it is very
large and the power density is low.  Adding another lens in front of the LED
doesn't help.  It is not possible to collimate it very well due to that large
emitting area (and the plastic lens that is likely present).
<p>
But, with a simple lens you could collimate the laser diode to a 5 mm (or
smaller) diameter beam with a very small fraction of a degree of divergence.
All of the light from this collimated laser could enter the eye easily and be
focused to a small spot nearly instantly burning a small pit in your retina.  
A collimated beam appears to be at an infinite distance even if its source is
up close.  The eye can focus it to a very small (diffraction limited) spot
with a high power density.
<p>
There will likely be safety warnings on the packaging for high power LEDs
though you won't find little tiny stickers on the LEDs themselves!

<h3><A NAME="dioled5">Wavelength Shift of LEDs at High Current</A></h3>

(From: Don Klipstein (don@Misty.com).)
<p>
In my experience, LEDs that shift to longer wavelengths when they overheat
have one distinct emission band.  That band shifts when they heat up.  What I
think happens is the conductance band and valence band widen from thermal
agitation and the "bandgap" between these bands gets narrower.  The result is
longer wavelength at higher temperatures.
<p>
Most of the usual common green LEDs have a noticeable color shift when they
overheat.  In my experience, they degrade slightly when they get hot enough
to shift to orange and stay that hot for a second or two.  At the maximum
temperature that they can withstand long term, there is hardly any visible
color shift.
<p>
Most yellow ones will shift to orange or reddish orange when overheated.
<p>
However, many LEDs have a spectral shift as a function of current which is
non-destructive.  For example:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Low current red GaP and GaP doped with ZnO, generally having a
 nominal peak wavelength of 690 or 697 nm, has two distinct spectral bands
 - a very broad one from orange to near-IR and a secondary one in the green
 to green-yellow.  As current rises past a few mA, efficiency decreases but
 the efficiency decrease is mainly in the red band.  As a result, higher
 current makes the color shift to orange.
<p>
<li>Other LEDs of types whose efficiency is maximized at low currents often
 have color visible shifting to shorter wavelengths at higher current and
 longer wavelengths at lower current.  Toyoda Gosei and Panasonic bright
 blue LEDs are cyan-aqua at 100 uA.  Most of the ultrabright 520 to 525 nm
 greens are yellowish at 50 to 100 uA, a beautiful green at 5 mA, and slightly
 blue-whitish at 30 mA.
<p>
<li>Original silicon carbide blue LEDs (without GaN) have efficiency
 peaking at low current and have color noticeably shifting as a function of
 current.  Higher current favors a shorter wavelength (azure blue) and
 lower current favors aqua or whitish-aqua (longer wavelength).  The
 bandwidth is large and does not vary much with current.
<p>
<li>InGaN LEDs (which include greens) have wavelength shifting a bit
 noticeably inversely with current, but bandwidth remains roughly constant.
<p>
<li>Older GaN 450 nm broad band blue develops a secondary minor spectral
 peak (more like just a little "bump") in the very near UV at very high
 currents that the LED can only survive for brief pulses.  More info in
 http://www.misty.com/~don/ledbl.html
<p>
 I do not know whether this is a fundamentally supposedly available spectral
 feature of GaN LEDs or "superluminescence" - a noisy/incoherent sort of
 oscillation via stimulated emission.
</ol>
<p>

I have pulsed every type of LED that I mention anywhere on my
(<A HREF="http://www.misty.com/people/don/ledx.html">LED Page</A>
using peak currents around half an amp in search of superluminescence
or other laser-like action showing distinct spectral features.  Results
entirely have been negative except for broad band 450 nm GaN LEDs such as
Nichia's now-obsolete NLPB types and some similar Panasonics that Digi-Key
used to sell a few years ago.
<p>
But there is such a thing as a "superluminescent diode" - a sort of
smaller-point-source LED that works like some sort of "incoherent laser
diode" (my words).

<h2>Availability of Green, Blue, and Violet Laser Diodes</h2>
<h3><A NAME="dioabg0">What's All the Fuss About?</A></h3>

!!!NEWS FLASH!!! (January 12, 1999) Nichia Chemical announces sample shipments
of VIOLET laserdiodes!
<p>
Preliminary specifications (Source: EE Times, January 18, 1999):
<ul>
<li>Wavelength: 400 nm (Border of violet-UV).
<li>Recommended Output Power: 5 mW.
<li>Maximum Output power: 30 mW/facet.
<li>Lifetime: 10,000 hours at 5 mW.
<li>Package: Industry standard 5.6 mm diameter can.
<li>Construction: GaN on Sapphire substrate, cleaved facets.
<li>Voltage: 5 volt operation (??).
<li>Threshold current 3.9 kA/cm<sup>2</sup> (No indication of absolute
 current).
<p>
<li>Engineering sample price: $2,000 (June, 1999).  Yikes!  And you can only
 get the privilege of buying them at this new low price by signing a
 non-disclosure agreement with Nichia.  OK, calm down.... In a couple of
 years, violet laser diodes will be $2.98 at your local Radio Shack. :)
</ul>
<p>
As of September 1999, Nichia appears ready to actually sell these things in
large volume for (hopefully) a reasonable price.
<p>
There is also a 30 mW version in the works or already available (November,
2000).  I don't even want to think about its price.  However, its MTTF is
quoted by Nichia to be only 500 hours at 25 &deg;C.  This means half will
fail by 500 hours.  Ouch! :)
<p>
Ironically, it seems that it may be easier to produce reliable violet laser
diodes rather than blue or green (despite possible previous reports of
demonstrations of blue ones at least).  This would be good news
for next generation optical storage (beyond DVD) and high resolution laser
printers but those wanting highly visible wavelengths (e.g., 555 nm green
and full color displays) may have to wait a bit longer.  The actual luminous
efficiency (relative visibility) at 400 nm is only about 0.28 percent of that
at 555 nm.  This corresponds to about 0.2 lumen/watt compared to 16 to 20
lumens/watt for a 100 W incandescent light bulb!  Nonetheless, this could be
the start of something spectacular. :)
<p>
However, Nichia is now (March, 2001) selling evaluation samples of a 430 to
445 nm 5 mW laser diode for <i>only</i> $3,000 each - and that bargain price
is probably after signing away all rights to your first born in their
non-disclosure agreement! :)  See:
<A HREF="http://www.nichia.co.jp/product/laser.html">Nichia Laser Diodes
Page</A>.
<p>
The availability of cheap, long lived, shorter wavelength (than the 635 to 650
nm types that are now used in better laser pointers and for DVD players and
drives) laser diodes could usher in yet another quantum leap in solid state
electro-optics technology.  (Yes, I know, taken literally, 'quantum leap' may
not make sense but you get the idea.)
<p>
When economical, these shorter wavelength laser diodes will represent the
enabling technology for yet another revolution in the storage capacity of
optical drives (at least a factor of two better than even DVD).  Compared to
the 4.5 GB capacity of one surface, one side of a DVD, a DUD (Digital Ultra
Disc/k) drive would hold about 13 GB/surface based on the wavelength
difference alone (635/400 squared).  The developers of the DVD standard
have already (as of Spring, 2002) developed a DUD standard so the World
will be ready and waiting when the cost of blue-violet laser diodes drops
to a reasonable level.  As if we need yet another new standard. :)
<p>
Shorter wavelength laser diodes should also find applications in higher
resolution laser printers and similar devices.  Blue wavelengths (not violet
though) would be ideal for underwater communications.  With the addition of
green laser diodes, compact full color displays and many other products would
quickly follow.  However, at the current time, only the violet laser diodes
at around 400 nm are commercially available - blue and green may still be a
few years away (as of January, 2000).
<p>
Blue and green has been widely demonstrated by SHG (second harmonic generation
also known as frequency doubling) in nonlinear crystals.  This approach is
widely used now for lasers of all sizes.  However, such technology is quite
complex and currently very expensive.  For example, a typical low power green
(532 nm) device such as found in a *green* laser pointer includes a high power
IR laser diode (emitting at around 808 nm) exciting a tiny Nd:YAG chip (which
lases at 1,064 nm) coupled to another chip of KTP which doubles its output to
532 nm - plus a whole bunch of needed optics to form a cavity, collimate the
beam, and prevent stray IR from escaping, all mounted in precise alignment.
No wonder they cost several hundred dollars!  A green laser diode would
eventually cost no more than the common red ones resulting similarly priced
green laser pointers (as if we need more of those!).  See the sections:
<A HREF="laserdio_ru.htm#diodlm2a">Green (or Other Color) Laser Pointers</A> and
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers</A>.
<p>
The direct emission from a semiconductor has been the Holy Grail for several
of laser engineering years. The semiconductor materials available with a
sufficiently wide band-gap are notoriously difficult to deposit and cleave.
Many companies around the world have been working on this problem but until
relatively recently, power output, operating temperature range, and/or laser
diode life have been unacceptable.  However, in late 1997, there was strong
evidence that all this was about to change:
<p>
<blockquote>
 "<A HREF="http://www.nichia.co.jp/.html">Nichia Chemical
 Industries</A>, Tokushima, Japan, has reported passing a major milestone
 in the development of blue laser diodes with the demonstration of a
 InGaN/GaN/AlGaN device with an estimated lifetime of more than 10,000 hours
 under CW operation at 20 &deg;C.  The announcement was made by Shuji
 Nakamura of Nichia on October 30, 1997, at the 2nd International Conference on
 Nitride Semiconductors, held in Tokushima, Japan.  Working devices have been
 demonstrated (even a laser pointer!) and there is reason to believe that they
 may be commercialized in the near future.  The same technology can also
 produce highly efficient laser diodes of other colors ranging from red through
 yellow and green."
</blockquote>
<p>
For over a year since this news release, there had been various hints that
such devices were moving closer to commercial production but until the News
Flash, above, in early 1999, no sample devices were available.  Now, it would
seem that the age of laser diodes of all colors of the spectrum is about to
begin.  [Hype mode off.] 
<p>
In October, 2001, Matsushita has announced a 410 nm laser using what appears
to be direct doubling of an 820 nm IR laser diode.
However, some of what they claim would appear
to be justification for this more complex approach compared to the Nichia
laser diode.  Supposedly, Matsushita expects the cost to be down in the
$10 range with mass production but even if it uses a self doubling crystal,
that would be impressive.  But, maybe the perceived competition will at least
help drive down Nichia's selling prices!
<p>
(From: HippyLaserTek (hippylasertek@aol.com).)
<p>
The cost of Nichia blue/violet laser diodes is high because of their
patent monopoly.  They patented the C-axis cut of sapphire crystal
wafers that is necessary to grow these diodes on. So far the only other
material they grow on is silicon carbide, but it doesn't match GaN lattice
that well making high power impossible, is much harder than sapphire and adds
about 3 to 5 V on top of the 4 to 5 V nitride voltage drop basically cooking
the poor little diode. :-(
<p>
Actual production cost is about 3 to 5 times that for making cheap red diodes.
Cutting and polishing sapphire wafers is much harder than gallium arsenide or
silicon, Sensitivity to contamination is an order of magnitude higher than for
GaALAsP red laser diodes, Scribing and cleaving is also more difficult because
of the hardness of sapphire If you look at the diode crystal with a strong
magnifier it is cleaved much more jagged then the red ones - the reject rate
must be very high!, Each chip requires TWO electrical wire bond connections
instead of one.
<p>
But still, $2K for a 5 mW diode that has no warranty and requires signing your
soul away to own? C'mon!
<p>
The company has also been VERY litigious also, even suing universities
experimenting with nitride laser technology for experimentation's sake as well
as the original inventor of the diodes, Shuji Nakamura, for the sole rights!
<p>
!!!NEWS FLASH!!! (June 19, 2002) The new DVD format "Blu-ray Disc" will use
blue/violet laser diodes at 405 nm.  So, if this
becomes THE standard, violet laser diode prices will drop eventually.
Since Nichia isn't part of the consortium that developed this specification,
and Matsushita/Panasonic is, it is likely that the intent is to use their
frequency doubled semiconductor laser.  However, if that were to drive down
the cost of the Nichia laser diode enough, switching to that might be an
eventual road to cost reduction.
<p>
In fact, as of Spring 2003, for the bargain price of $3800, you can buy
a high speed DVD recorder which supports the Blu-ray standard as well as
the DVD-R and DVD-RW formats (but not DVD+RW or DVD-RAM).  See:
<A HREF="http://optics.org/articles/news/9/3/4/1">News - Violet Laser Recoreder

<p>
There appear to be other companies now selling UV/blue laser diodes that
might not be of Nichia origin.  One is
<A HREF="http://www.photonic-products.com/products/sanyo_violet_laser_diodes/sanyo_violetblue.htm">Sanyo Blue Violet Laser Diodes</A> and

<p>
Now (March 2007, how time flies!), Sony's PlayStation 3 which includes a
Blu-ray drive is now widely available.
And, replacements Blu-ray optical deck assemblies can be found on eBay
(and elsewhere) at very inexpensively (as these things go).
They appear to be genuine but I don't know of anyone who has actually
installed one in a PS3.  However, they do have healthy combined IR/red/violet
laser diodes which is really what you care about, right?  Whether these units
are actually distributed by Sony as service parts, "fell" off a truck or
container ship, or found their way to eBay by some other means, is also
unknown. :) Search on eBay for "KES-400AAA".  For many photos and a detailed

Sanyo has a 50 mW now available in low quantities. Sony does too, but you
have to have an inside track to get them (still some patent issues). We can
only get them through our office in Japan, and only in small quantities.
I've heard they have significantly different characteristics, but haven't
seen any data / specifics on them yet.

A few other companies in the mix also, but no commercial devices available.
I think Toyota has one in prototype now.

I've been working in the nitrides for a couple of years and it is the case that
the lasers lase easiest and best right around 400 nm, from ~395 to 420 nm.
Going further either way is tough, but Nichia may be able to do it.  Nakamura
keeps astonishing us all. They do have amber nitride-based LEDs, which is
another amazing accomplishment that no one else has repeated."

Nakamura demonstrated a hand-held near-UV LD system some two years ago (if I
remember right) at the Strasbourg EMRS meeting. He told, that visible (blue)
laser operation was not yet possible (2 years ago - 1997).  So, now the
announcement of a 400 nm LD is good news - although this seems rather the
limit for visible.

I think most of the reports should be properly labeled violet, not blue.  The
ones I've seen have all been violet.  The longest wavelength I've seen in the
literature were Xerox's and Cree's lasers: ~430 nm.
<p>
Nichia started out around 420 to 411 nm under pulsed operation in 1996 and have
been getting shorter in wavelength as they have gone CW and long lived.  For
instance, lifetime and wavelength went as follows:
<ul>
30 minutes: 409 nm<br>
27 hours: 408 nm<br>
300 hours: 408 nm<br>
1000 hours: 401 nm<br>
10000 hours: 397 nm<br>
</ul>
Wavelengths of other pulsed lasers:
<ul>
Fujitsu: 411 nm<br>
Cree: 404 to 430 nm<br>
Sony: 411 nm<br>
Xerox: 419 to 432 nm<br>
UCSB: 420 nm<br>
</ul>
There are probably many reasons that longer wavelength is more difficult.  A
few I would suggest are that the active quantum wells are InGaN solid solutions
and as the In concentration goes up (longer wavelength) it creates poorer
quality wells and interfaces thus reducing radiative efficiency.  Also, it
turns out  that you need some indium in the material to be an efficient emitter
so that further into UV is difficult. (GaN alone is not nearly as efficient as
an InGaN layer.)

<h2>An Ophthalmic Retinal Coagulator Laser System</h2>

Without a doubt, lasers have had a large impact in many areas of medical
diagnosis and treatment.  Not surprisingly, some of the earliest medical
applications of lasers were in disorders of the eye.  In particular,
the highly collimated and intense beam from a laser is ideal for getting
to the otherwise inaccessible area of the retina at the back of the eye.
<p>
All types of lasers have been used for ophthalmic applications including ruby,
argon ion, krypton ion, high power diode and green diode pumped solid state
(DPSS).  In this section, we describe one of the simplest and inexpensive
(as these things go) ophthalmic lasers based on high power infra-red laser
diodes.

<h3><A NAME="diodc3000d">Description of the DC-3000</A></h3>

The Nidek DC-3000 is a system that provides up to 2 W of output power via
several types of fiber-optic delivery devices for use in treating a variety
of retinal eye disorders and is typical of this type of laser.  While the
DC-3000 dates from the early 1990s, the DC-3300, which is the modern version,
has virtually identical specifications (but a spiffier front panel!).
More information including detailed specifications may
be found on the <A HREF="http://www.nidek.com/">Nidek</A> Web site.
Similar ophthalmic lasers are manufactured by other companies.
<p>
The overall system consists of the laser itself with a user friendly
control panel, and the delivery devices.  There is also a detector
unit for checking power output.

<p>
The laser/optics consists of a pair of SDL (probably SDL-237X) ~800 nm laser
diodes with beam shaping and collimating optics feeding a polarizing beam
splitter used as a beam combiner.  Both diodes are oriented the same way so one
of them has a half wave plate in its beam path to rotate the polarization
by 90 degrees.  I assume two diodes were used either because a single
high power diode would have had too large a stripe width to be easily
coupled into the fiber, or because a suitable single high power diode wasn't
available at the time.  It appears as though both diodes are used at all
power levels.
<p>
The collimated combined beam passes a photodiode power monitor beam sampler
and a dichroic mirror to combine it with the aiming beam from a red HeNe laser.
The beam sampler must also check for back reflections because the laser
produces an error and shuts down if the output alignment is highly incorrect.
<p>
The beam is then focused via an anamorphic lens into a fiberoptic cable of the
delivery device.  For the ENDO probes, the fiber core diameter is 400 um
and virtually 100 percent of the power in the collimated beam makes it into
the fiber.  However, for the other delivery devices, the fiber core may be
only 180 um, in which case there is some loss, perhaps on the order of
25 percent.  This is one of the reasons the specifications call for only
1,500 mW except with the ENDO probes.
