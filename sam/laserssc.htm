<h2>Introduction to Complete SS Laser Power Supply Schematics</h2>

This chapter contains circuit diagrams for several power supplies for pulsed
solid state lasers.  These include units suitable for driving the popular
Hughes ruby and YAG rangefinder laser assemblies as well, one using the
flash from a disposable pocket camera, and a high energy flashlamp power
supply for that 8 inch long surplus NOVA laser rod you have been saving. :)
<p>
The pulse forming network is what determines the performance of a pulsed solid
state laser.  Thus, there is a great deal of flexibility in the design of
the capacitor charger and trigger circuits.  Systems designed for other
applications can often be adapted for solid state laser power supplies.  See
the chapter: <A HREF="lasersps.htm#spstoc">SS Laser Power Supplies</A> for
more information.  And the schematics in this chapter can be easily modified
for larger, smaller, or different types of solid state lasers.
<p>
WARNING: All of these systems are potentially lethal - some just more lethal
than others.  Hey, but when you're dead, it probably doesn't matter how well
done you are.  Before even thinking about building or going near one of
these systems, make sure you have thoroughly read, understand, and follow
the laser and electrical safety guideline provided elsewhere in this document!

<h2>Pulse Forming Network 1 and SSY1 Trigger PCB</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscpfn11">Description of PFN1</A></h3>

PFN1 (manufacturer and model unidentified) is a combination of a 36 uF, 950 V
energy storage capacitor, 0.03 mH inductor, automatic bleeder circuit, and
various connectors and other stuff.  The capacitor is marked with its rating
but the inductor is not and its value was determined by performing a 'ring
test' using both a separate high-Q 1 uF capacitor and then the one in the PFN.
<p>
The original application for PFN1 was most likely to be used with the SSY1
laser head (see the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclsy1">A Small
Nd:YAG Laser - SSY1</A>).  The maximum useful energy into the flashlamp is
around 14 to 15 J when charged to just over 900 V.
<A HREF="pfn1.gif">Pulse Forming Network 1</A> shows the assembly with major
components labeled.  This unit is/was available from
<A HREF="http://www.mi-lasers.com/">Meredith Instruments</A>.
<p>
When used without modification, the combination of the 36 uF capacitor and
0.03 mH inductor will result in a 50 to 100 us pulse duration (dependent on
other circuit parameters, probably closer to 100 us in practice).  This is
quite well matched to a Nd:YAG rod.  With a well designed cavity, 15 J should
be enough to threshold a 50 mm x 4 mm Nd:YAG rod (which is what it apparently
was intended to pump) and considerably more than enough for a 25 mm rod.
<p>
Note that the capacitor in PFN1 is a very high quality non-electrolytic
type.  It may be a Polyester film capacitor with an ESR (Equivalent Series
Resistance) of around 0.02 Ohm (compared to almost 1 Ohm for a combination
of electrolytic photoflash caps with the same uF and V ratings).  The
extremely low ESR is essential to achieve the required short pulse duration
at reasonable efficiency (i.e., maximizing energy transfer to the flashlamp)
or at all.
<p>
Should you desire to disassemble PFN1 to remount the components in your very
own more aesthetically pleasing housing, here is the procedure:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the other usable components from the PFN1 casting, unsolder the
 capacitor wire that goes through the base, and free up the other longer
 capacitor wire by breaking it free of the Epoxy globs fastening it in place
 and then tuck it out of the way so it won't get damaged (e.g., wrapped
 in a tight spiral on the end of the capacitor).
<p>
<li>Use a hack saw or rotary tool to slice the thin cast metal surrounding
 the capacitor just deep enough to reach the tough rubbery potting compound
 and no deeper.  This may have to be done in several places lengthwise,
 as well as around the base of the capacitor (next to where the other
 components were mounted).
<p>
<li>Then, carefully but persuasively pry the metal pieces from the potting
 compound leaving the capacitor stuck to the base.  It's better to make
 some more cuts than to use a lot of force.
<p>
<li>Make sure the wire that penetrates the base is free and pry the capacitor
 from the base.
<p>
<li>Slice the potting compound lengthwise using a sharp blade,
 again taking special care not to penetrate the capacitor skin.
<p>
<li>Peel off the potting compound, making more cuts if needed.
<p>
<li>It should be possible to peel the potting compound from the bottom of
 the capacitor but the adhesion there seems to be much stronger than to
 the yellow Mylar and it doesn't look so bad left in place. :)
</ol>
<p>
(From Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
This power supply does sound right on the money for a small military Nd:YAG
laser, as used in rangefinding, target designators, or illuminators. Typically
these lasers are designed to run off of batteries or on-board DC power lines.
Typical pulse repetition rates for these systems are on the order of 10 pps
and power to charge the cap is usually provided by a DC-to-AC converter,
step-up transformer, HV rectifier, PFN, and a parallel trigger circuit.
Another much used military PSU operates on the principle of a flyback DC-AC
converter.
<p>
Your calculations as to the pulse width of the lamp sound just about
right. With Nd:YAG's fluorescent lifetime being 230 us, this pulse width
would make perfect sense for maximum energy transfer.

 Pulse Forming Network 1.  This includes the 36 uF energy storage capacitor,
 pulse shaping inductor, automatic bleeder circuit, and various (useless)
 connectors, wires, and a pot. :)
</ul>
<p>
The automatic bleeder circuit is something that really should be kept intact
even if the useless wiring and that pot are removed.  The normally closed
contacts of the vacuum relay connect a 10K ohm resistor across the energy
storage capacitor whenever the relay's coil loses power.  The capacitor will
be fully discharged in a couple of seconds.  This is an important safety
feature!

<h3><A NAME="sscssy1t">Trigger Circuit (TRG1)</A></h3>

The original trigger PCB from SSY1 doesn't seem to be as common on the
surplus market as the SSY1 laser head and PFN1.
<p>
(From: Richard.)
<p>
A diagram of both PFN1 and TRG1 is available in PDF format:  (Parts
designations for PFN1 may differ from the schematic, above.)
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="pftr1sch.pdf">PFTR1-SCH</A> - Pulse Forming Network 1 (PFN1) and
 Trigger (TRG1).  For TRG1, a logic level signal
 (low) turns on a Q1 which drives the Q2 to dump C2 (charged to around
 240 V) through the trigger transformer, T1.
</ul>
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The actual input to the trigger circuit is a bit strange.
In fact, I went and checked the actual PCB to make sure the diagram
was accurate.
<p>
It would seem that you have to apply a high level to the Logic Trigger
input to charge C3 (through D3) and then pull it to ground.  C3 then
powers the circuit long enough to turn the SCR on.  A normal TTL signal may
be satisfactory.  If you're just going to trigger it manually, then
start with a 5 or 6 VDC power supply or a battery and see if that works.
It may take more voltage.

<h2>Sam's AC Line Power Supply for a SSY1 (SG-SP1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscsg11">Description of SG-SP1</A></h3>

This is a basic, but complete power supply for driving the SSY1 or simlar
small YAG laser head (see the sections: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclsy1">A Small
Nd:YAG Laser - SSY1</A> and <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslmyl">Mini YAG Laser using
SSY1 Optics and SG-SP1</A>.  (For a more polished version of this system,
see the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg6">Sam's Small Adjustable Power
Supply for Solid State Pulsed Lasers (SG-SP4)</A>.
<p>
I used components from <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscpfn1">Pulse Forming
Network 1</A> and added a line powered capacitor charger and push button
operated trigger circuit.  A better than 1 pps repetition rate is possible
(and considerably more if R1 were reduced in size).  Current, the components
are sort of strewn all over my workbench - which I definitely don't recommend
for safety reasons.  Eventually, it will be built into a proper case.
<p>
The capacitor charger consists of a 700 VRMS output power transformer, a relic
of the vacuum tube age though brand new in its original box. :)  I used the
low voltage outputs (the 5 V and 6.3 V filament windings, not shown on the
schematics) anti-phase in series with the line to slightly drop the the output
to about 650 VRMS resulting in just over 900 VDC maximum after rectification
and filtering by the main energy storage capacitor (C1).  A 300K ohm bleeder
resistance discharges C1 in about 30 seconds.  The original PFN1 had a relay
activated fast discharge circuit using a 10K resistor.  Whenever it was
de-energized, the resistor was placed directly across C1 discharging it in
less than a second.  I highly recommend using this if possible.
<p>
Unless you have a similar transformer to that Stancor laying around, I'd
suggest trying to use something more modern.  I doubt you could even buy it
today and even if you could, the cost would be ridiculous.  One option might
be a 230 VAC transformer and a tripler made from 3 diodes (1 kV, e.g., 1N4007)
and 2 electrolytic caps (450 to 500 V, probably around 10 uF).  This would
produce an output that is around 900 V peak.  Or, a small
dual primary, dual secondary isolation transformer wired to produce 345 VAC
(three windings in series) followed by a voltage doubler (2 diodes,
2 capacitors as above).
<p>
The trigger circuit consists of a tap off of the bleeder resistance at the
1/3rd voltage point (so about 300 V when the power supply is operating at 900 V
output).  This charges a .05 uF capacitor which is dumped into the trigger
transformer (type unknown - looks like a large photoflash variety) when the
push button switch (S2) is depressed.  It's possible that one of the tiny
units from a disposable pocket camera won't work reliably as drawn.  However,
you can adjust the size of the trigger cap and/or trigger cap charging voltage
to optimize performance for the trigger transformer of your choice.  The use
of a piezo barbeque igniter is also a good solution if you don't need something
fired electrically. :)
<p>
I have installed SG-SP1 in a handy aluminum case with a connector to permit
any small flashlamp pumped laser head to be easily attached.  It may be used
as described above or as a general purpose capacitor charger for higher energy
PFNs.
<p>
WARNING: The AC line input and the energy stored in the PFN can be lethal.  An
interlock should be included (not shown) to remove input power and bleed off
the charge on the energy storage capacitor should the case be opened.
<p>
CAUTION: Although the capacitor in the PFN that comes with SSY1 is rated
for around 35 uF at 900 VDC, running at this energy may destroy the Q-switch
dye cell and possibly the AR coating on the YAG rod adjacent to it after
not too many shots.  Some samples may survive almost indefinitely
but others could succumb in less than 100 shots.  I would recommend
limiting the voltage for repetitive use to 700 or at most 750 VDC.

<h3><A NAME="sscsg13">Don's Comments on the SSY1 Flashlamp</A></h3>

The following was prompted by my request for opinions on the possibility of
increasing the flash energy to the flashlamp in the SSY1 to boost its output
pulse energy.  Based on Don's comments, I think I won't push my luck!
<p>
(Recall that the SSY1 flashlamp is about 5 mm OD, 3 mm ID, with an arc length
of 35 mm.  Using PFN1 in SG-SP1, the maximum input energy from SG-SP1 is about
15 J in about 100 us.)
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (Don@Misty.com).)
<p>
Explosion energy for 100 us is about 1.1 joules times arc length in mm
times bore diameter in mm for quartz.  EG&G recommends 30 percent of this
for good repeated use of quartz (mere thousands of flashes) so I recommend
15 percent of the explosion energy if it is glass.
<p>
For a length of 35 mm and a bore of 3 mm, explosion energy would then be 115.5
joules.  15 percent of this is not much more than the 15 joules you're using
now.
<p>
The capacitance and inductance and voltage (36 uF, 30 uH, 900 volts) sounds
about right for this flashtube and flash duration.
<p>
If you want to push things, for one thing I would increase the flash
duration accordingly.  Explosion energy increases with the square root of
flash duration.  For flashes this short, you get that increase with glass
as well as quartz.  (This rule holds with quartz to a flash duration up to
10 milliseconds; glass levels off much sooner!)
<p>
If you want to push that flashtube, just increase the capacitance and
the inductance accordingly.  You can probably get away with doubling the
capacitance, but that is pushing things.
<p>
If you ruin that tube, then I recommend getting a real flashtube from
EG&G Electro-Optics Division, which will sell to small time consultants
and probably even obvious hobbyists and the like.  But they cost about
$300 or something like that.  But they're quartz and xenon pressure is
known (450 Torr unless otherwise specified) and you can get just about any
length and diameter almost off-the-shelf.  Their catalog items are
actually semi-custom parts.
<p>
Their catalog has 2/4 and 3/5 mm. (bore/OD) tubes in 1, 2, and 3 inch
arc lengths.  They also have 4 mm bore 6 mm OD tubes in 2, 3, and 4 inch
arc lengths.  And all sorts of bigger tubes.  One of these should do a
good job of increasing the danger of your YAG laser.  You probably want
the ones designated "low power air cooled".

<h2>Sam's Small Adjustable Power Supply for Solid State Pulsed Lasers (SG-SP4)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscsg61">Description of SG-SP4</A></h3>

After getting tired of SG-SP1 looking somewhat like a random pile of junk, I
built it into a nice case and gave it a dedicated Variac and voltmeter, and
added a thyristor triggering circuit with pushbutton as well as external (logic
level) activation.  Both the spiff and safety factors are thus greatly
improved. :)
<p>
SG-SP4 still includes the basic PFN1 and trigger output and can drive SSY1
and similar laser heads directly.  However, it can also be used as a general
purpose capacitor charger for laser heads requiring greater energy input (at
up to 900 V).

<h2>Sam's Inverter Power Supply for SSY1 (SG-SI1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscsg21">Description of SG-SI1</A></h3>

This power supply runs off of 12 VDC and is based on a high frequency inverter
driven by a 555 timer.  A voltage comparator monitors the voltage on the
energy storage capacitor and disables the 555 timer by forcing reset, cycling
on and off to maintain full charge.  The inverter transformer is similar to
the one used in the helium-neon laser power supply described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic3">HeNe Laser Power Supply from HeNe Laser Pointer
(IC-HI3)</A> but with slightly thicker wire and correspondingly larger core
to handle the potentially higher charging power.
<p>
Before you lament the difficulty in winding the inverter transformer, the
design found in the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sschss1">Simple Inverter
Capacitor Charger Based on HSS1</A> requires a transformer with a grand total
of 32 turns of wire!  That circuit can be substituted here for the lazy at
heart. :)
<p>
Like SG-SP1, it uses PFN1 as the pulse forming network.  A bleeder relay (K1)
has been added since the values of the resistors in the original voltage
divider circuit (R2 to R4) have been increased with a corresponding increase in
discharge time to a value too long for safety.  K1 will discharge the main
energy storage capacitor in about 5 seconds when power is removed.
<p>
As shown, SG-SI1 may be powered by a 12 V battery pack and mates directly with
the SSY1 laser head.  The voltage to which the energy storage capacitor gets
charged may be adjusted between near 0 and around 900 V.  SSY1 will require
a minimum of about 650 V to reach threshold.  However, SG-SI1 can easily be
adapted for a lower or higher input voltage and/or for other small solid state
pulsed lasers, photoflash units, or xenon strobes.
<p>
The turns ratio of T1 has been selected so that the voltage on C1 tops off
at 900 to 950 V with a 12 VDC input.  This is safe for the PFN1 even if the
voltage comparator circuit fails to disable the 555 oscillator circuit.  As
additional protection (especially if your particular PFN has a lower voltage
rating for C1), one option would be a string of high voltage zeners (total
value selected for your PFN) and current limiting resistor attached to C1
feeding a transistor or SCR to kill input power and set a fault indicator
should the normal voltage limiting fail to function for any reason.
Increasing the turns ratio of T1 modestly might reduce charge time but then it
is even more critical to provide some redundant protection so that the voltage
is prevented from climbing above the max voltage rating of C1.
<p>
WARNING: Although SG-SI1 is powered by a low voltage source, the energy stored
in the PFN can still be lethal.  An interlock should be included (not shown) to
remove input power and bleed off the charge on the energy storage capacitor
should the case be opened.
<p>
Note: The inverter portion of SG-SI1 has <b>not</b> been tested.

stored in the PFN can still be lethal.  An interlock should be included (not

capacitor should the case be opened.
<p>
I would also recommend adding a fail-safe
means of limiting the output voltage on the energy storage capacitor should
the feedback circuitry fail for some reason.  One simple approach is to have
a string of 11 NE2H neon lamps in series with a current limiting resistor
across the capacitor.  The lamps will turn on at just under 1 KV and provide
a load for the inverter reducing the voltage to a safe value until the power
input can be removed.  (A HeNe laser tube will NOT work in place of the neon
lamps as it has a very high starting voltage requirement compared to what is
safe for this circuit.)

<h2>Sam's HeNe Laser PSU Based Power Supply for SSY1 (SG-SH1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscsg71">Description of SG-SH1</A></h3> 

Rather than building a HV inverter from scratch, the power supply for a small
helium-neon laser can be pressed into service as a capacitor charging
supply.  Since HeNe laser power supplies are constant current sources, for
this application, the unit selected must have some type of logic control to
turn it on and off as a means of limiting the output voltage to the energy
storage capacitor.  Most potted "bricks" for barcode scanners and similar
applications have this feature.  Otherwise, some alternative means of
limiting the output voltage must be provided.  Small HeNe laser power supplies
are readily available surplus at attractive prices.
<p>
The unit I used was a Laser Drive model 103-23 HeNe laser power supply brick
from an Orion barcode scanner.  It runs on 21-31 VDC at under 0.5 A and
outputs a constant 3.5 mA from less than 1 kV to about 2 kV and includes a
logic input that needs to be grounded to turn the supply on.  A HV zener
diode and a pair of transistors were added so that the output on the energy
storage could be limited to a value between about 500 and 900 VDC (using the
component values shown in the schematic).  This particular power supply has
enough hysteresis in the logic input so that no additional circuitry is needed
to provide clean on-off of the power supply's inverter.  The voltage climbs
linearly to the set value with the power supply turning on every few seconds
for an instant to keep it there.  With the 3.3 mA output, cycle time for 900 V
on the 36 uF energy storage capacitor is about 10 seconds.  A HeNe laser power
supply that can deliver 6.5 mA would cut this in half.
<p>
CAUTION: Since this application is running the HeNe laser power supply in a
non-standard way, there are no guarantees about reliability or life expectancy
with repeated pulsing via the feedback circuit.  It may also have some problems
if the series resistors (R1-R3) aren't selected to put the min-max voltage
it sees on its output safely within its voltage compliance range.  The 103-23
hesitates a bit when starting from 0 V, possibly sensing (incorrectly) a
short circuit condition but seems to be happy enough otherwise.  However,
some HeNe laser power supplies simply won't start into a resistive load at 0 V.
<p>
WARNING: Although SG-SH1 is powered by a low voltage source, the energy
stored in the PFN can still be lethal.  An interlock should be included (not
shown) to remove input power and bleed off the charge on the energy storage
capacitor should the case be opened.
<p>
I would also recommend adding a fail-safe
means of limiting the output voltage on the energy storage capacitor should
the feedback circuitry fail for some reason.  One simple approach is to have
a string of 11 NE2H neon lamps in series with a 25K 2 W resistor
across the capacitor.  The lamps will turn on at just under 1 KV and provide
a load for the inverter reducing the voltage to a safe value until the power
input can be removed.  (A HeNe laser tube will NOT work in place of the neon
lamps as it has a very high starting voltage requirement compared to what is
safe for this circuit.)

<h3><A NAME="sscsg31">SG-SP2 Operation</A></h3>

<ol>
<li>Power transformer, T1, in conjunction with D1, D2, and C1-C4, provides
   1.7 kV DC.  The power supply doubler capacitors are also used as the
   energy storage capacitors.  Resistors, R1-R4, equalize the voltage drops
   across the series capacitors to compensate for slight differences in
   leakage resistance.  R5 and R6 limit inrush current and charge rate.
<p>
<li>The trigger capacitor, C5, charges through T2 from the voltage divider
   formed by R7 and R8.
<p>
<li>Ready light and capacitor bank voltage monitoring circuits are not shown.
<p>
<li>Applying a 5 V signal to the Fire input turns on SCR1 dumping C5 into
   the primary of the trigger transformer, T2.  This generates a 30 kV pulse
   which ionizes the xenon gas in the flashlamp, FL1.
<p>
<li>The energy storage capacitor bank discharges through L1 and FL1.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="sscsg32">SG-SP2 Notes</A></h3>

<ol>
<li>WARNING: If you thought line operated equipment was dangerous, this is
 much much worse.  The power transformer output is enough to kill.  Once
 doubled and stored in the capacitor bank, it is LETHAL.  The total energy
 storage is about 1300 W-s (this is not a typo!).  Based on one estimate,
 this is enough energy to KILL 20 adult humans simultaneously with the
 power supply unplugged from the AC line - and still have some juice left
 over.  TAKE EXTREME CARE!
<p>
<li>Fuse, power switch, power-on light, and all other absolutely essential
 safety interlocks and indicators are not shown.  R1-R4 do act as bleeder
 resistors and will discharge the capacitor bank to safe levels in about
 10 MINUTES.  However, don't depend on these.  Resistors can fail.  Use
 the capacitor discharge tool and indicator.
<p>
<li>The power transformer from a tube type (old) TV set would probably be
 suitable for T1.  Microwave oven high voltage rectifiers may be used
 for D1 and D2.  A high power xenon tube like this requires a 30+ kV
 trigger pulse.  Those little tiny trigger transformers will NOT work.
<p>
<li>The energy storage capacitors, C1 to C4, must be rated for photoflash
 rapid discharge operation or else they won't survive and/or won't be able
 to deliver a fast enough output pulse.  In fact, for Nd:YAG (or similar
 solid state laser mediums with short fluorescence lifetimes, special
 (non-electrolytic) types will be needed.  But, you may need to take out a
 second mortgage to finance them. :)  Electrolytic types will work for ruby
 pumping with it's 3 ms fluorescence lifetime.
<p>
<li>High power strobes require special flashlamps - anything from a pocket
 camera or electronic flash will explode into a mass of molten bits of
 glass and metal.  This design is suitable for driving 2 of the largest of
 the EG&G 1300 series flashlamps, the FXQ-1305-6 and -9.  These have arc
 lengths of 6 and 9 <b>inches</b> respectively!    See the
 section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslegg">EG&G 1300 Series Linear Flashlamp
 Specifications and Links</A> for more info.
<p>
 Even a properly specified flashlamp may explode and must be operated behind
 protective shielding or as in the case of a typical laser, fully enclosed
 in the cavity reflector.  Flashlamp cooling must be adequate for desired
 cycle time.
<p>
<li>L1 helps to shape the discharge current pulse.  For some high power
 strobe designs, a series inductor is essential to optimize power output
 and prevent damage to the flashlamp due to excessively high current and
 negative voltage (undershoot resulting in reverse current).  A damping
 factor of .8 is generally recommended.  The 25 uH value is just an
 estimate - L1 must be calculated for each combination of energy storage
 capacitor value, voltage, and the impedance characteristics of the
 specific flashlamp to be used.
<p>
<li>If you are serious about constructing a high energy strobe system (and
 your life and accident insurance is fully paid), consider some advanced
 reading first.  The flashlamp manufacturer's datasheets and application
 notes will prove essential.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslosi">Other Sources of Information on Solid State
 Lasers</A> and the sections starting with <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslxen">Xenon
 Flashlamps</A>.
<p>
<li>Maximum flash energy is about 1300 W-s.  For a typical flash duration of
 250 us, this is an equivalent power input to the flashlamp of 5.2 MW!
 Adjust component values for the desired application.
<p>
<li>DO NOT even think about staring at the flashlamp when fired.  The peak
 light output is equivalent to at least 500,000, 100 W light bulbs!
 Even when averaged over the 1/40th of a second typical response of the
 human eye, this is still more than 5,000, 100 W light bulbs.  (Note:
 this estimate takes into account the increased luminous efficiency of
 xenon flashlamps compared to incandescent light bulbs.)
<p>
<li>Make sure all optical components - especially the flashlamp - are cleaned
    with isopropyl alcohol and a lint free cloth to remove all traces of
    contaminants.

<h2>Sam's High Energy AC Line Power Supply for SSY1 (SG-SP3)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscsg51">Description of SG-SP3</A></h3>

This power supply is designed to push the pedal to the metal (as they say)
with respect to SSY1.  It was prompted by the truly spectacular performance
described in the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclss1s">Shawn's High Energy
Experiments with the SSY1 Laser Head</A>.
<p>
CAUTION: Although this should be operating the flashlamp within spec when
run at low duty cycle, it is still what's known as "pushing the envelope".
Use at your own discretion.  
<p>
The capacitor charger consists of a 650 VRMS output power transformer driven
by a Variac to provide up to about 450 VDC from a full wave rectifier.  The
transformer I used is extremely overrated current-wise.  A smaller one could
be used since the cycle time is so long and the average power requirement is
only about 10 W.
<p>
A couple of alternatives are also shown in the schematic:

<ul>
<li>A small isolation transformer with 4, 115 VAC windings (dual primary and
 dual secondary) could be used wired with the input connected to one primary
 and the output connected to the other primary in series with both
 secondaries.  A bridge rectifier is substituted for the full wave rectifier
 in this case.  The Variac could even be eliminated where two output energy
 levels are sufficient by providing a switch to select just the dual
 secondaries for the lower output energy.  An off position of this switch
 would allow the caps to be charged to any desired level and (more or less)
 held there.
<p>
<li>A line-connected tripler could substitute for at least the power
 transformer (T2).  This is much lighter and cheaper but doesn't provide line
 isolation so that <b>no</b> circuitry may be connected to a metal case
 or earth ground - even the negative of the capacitor bank and flashlamp.
 Considering the totally lethal nature of the rest of the unit, this
 incremental increase in danger potential is relatively small.
</ul>

An inverter based capacitor charger similar to
<A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg2">Sam's Inverter Power Supply for SSY1
(SG-SI1)</A> could also be used if modified appropriately for the desired
cutoff voltage higher power operation.
<p>
The capacitor bank is a pair of 1,800 uF, 450 V, electrolytics (never used but
quite old Mallary "computer grade" units in my implementation).  CAUTION:
Some means should be provided to prevent the voltage from exceeding the 450 V
ratings of C1 and C2.  While electrolytic capacitors generally have some
safety margin, it is best to obey the rules.  Depending on your actual line
voltage, the charging schemes described above may be operating close to the
edge when set for maximum energy. :)
<p>
The trigger circuit is basically the same one used in SG-SP1 (except for part
numbers) but since the maximum voltage is lower, it operates from 2/3rds of
the capacitor voltage instead of 1/3rd.
<p>
D3 and D4 are reverse protection diodes for the capacitor bank (C1,C2)
and flashlamp (FL1), respectively.  They need to have a voltage rating of
at least 500 V and a peak current rating of several hundred amps.  However,
the continuous current and power ratings can be small since the duty cycle
is very low - or zero.  I don't know if either of these diodes would ever
conduct under normal conditions as the circuit is not likely to be
underdamped.  I would suggest a 600 to 1,000 V plastic cased diode with a
200 A or greater I<sub>FSM</sub> rating.  They don't need to be fast recovery
or other special types.  Or, leave them out and measure the residual voltage
on C1/C2 and FL1 after a trial shot - if they are both positive, the diodes
aren't needed.
<p>
The panel meter is calibrated to read 500 V full scale.  Of course, it would
be really cool to have it display energy in joules.  This would make a nice
little project in itself.  An A/D to monitor the capacitor voltage along with
a PIC or other single chip microprocessor, or maybe just an EPROM or Flash
based lookup table could do the conversion.  Or, even simpler, an analog
multiplier configured to square and scale the voltage. :)
<p>
A relay connects a high power bleeder resistor to the capacitor bus when
power is removed or switched off, the case is opened, or the neighborhood
experiences a blackout due to the use of this device) and the capacitor bank
is thus automatically discharged.  However, even with the relatively low ohm
resistor, reaching a safe level still takes 10 seconds or so.  A 'Live'
indicator lamp (IL2) shows when the voltage on the caps is above about 100 V.
<p>
Cycle time is limited by the average power rating of the flashlamp.
<p>
WARNING: The AC line input and the energy stored in the PFN can be lethal -
especially the energy stored in the capacitor bank!  In fact, conservatively,
there are enough joules there at maximum voltage (360 J) to kill dead-dead,
six large adult humans simultaneously with the power off!  Take extreme care
and don't assume anything!

<h2>Simple Capacitor Charger for SSY1</h2>

For testing at least, it doesn't take much to run SSY1.  All it takes is
a source of at least 450 VDC and a basic trigger circuit either from a
disposable camera or built with a readily available trigger transformer.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Power source:</b> 450 to 500 VDC at a few mA.  This can be a AC line
 operated power transformer, a DC to DC converter brick, a pair of flash
 circuits from disposable cameras in series, or a small HeNe laser power
 supply as discussed above.
<p>
<li><b>Energy storage capacitor:</b> 150 to 200 uF photoflash rated capacitor
 with sufficient voltage rating.  These are available from electronics
 distributors but can be readily obtained from disposable camera flash
 units.  Four to six in a series-parallel configuration would be required.
 When using electrolytic capacitors, no additional pulse forming network
 components are really needed.
<p>
<li><b>Trigger circuit:</b> I do not know if the trigger circuit from a
 disposable camera flash is adequate to reliably fire the SSY1 flashlamp.
 However, it's very easy to construct a higher energy trigger circuit using
 a trigger transformer from a place like Digikey.  A BBQ lighter or electric
 match (minus the fuel!) can also be used.
</ul>
<p>
With the long pulse duration and relatively high ESR of the electrolytic
capacitors, performance won't be as great as with a high quality capacitor.
However, it should be quite adequate for basic testing.  In fact, the inset
photo in <A HREF="ssy1a.jpg">SSY1 Laser Head Assembly</A> (photo courtesy
of Chad Anderson) was made with just such a setup using a 200 uF, 450 V
Rubicon capacitor, charged to around 450 V by a DC to DC converter, and
home-built trigger circuit.

<h2>Simple Inverter Capacitor Charger Based on HSS1</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sschss10">Basic Description of HSS1</A></h3>

HSS1 (High Speed Strobe 1) is a short pulse strobe originally designed by
Don Klipstein <A HREF="mailto:don@misty.com">don@misty.com</A> and myself
(Sam) for a special application requiring a very short flash duration (under 50
microseconds), triggering from a logic level input, and portability.  However,
for our purposes, the inverter is of most interest because its simplicity,
robustness, and ease of construction.  It will operate from a 12 to 18 VDC
power supply with a cycle time of less than 3 seconds for the 36 uF energy
storage capacitor charged to 900 V (15 J, same as the cap in PFN1/SSY1).  The
capacitor voltage is actively regulated with the inverter running as required
to maintain full charge. Current consumption (at 12 VDC input) is around 1 A
while charging and averages less than 50 mA (in periodic 1 A pulses) while
idling.  To reduce idle current consumption to near zero, the inverter may
be controlled and monitored via the system logic.

<h3><A NAME="sschss11">HSS1 Schematics</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for HSS1 in PDF format:
 <A HREF="hss1sch.pdf">HSS1-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
HSS1 consists of the inverter, pulse forming network, and trigger circuit.
<p>
One beauty of this inverter design is the super simple transformer requiring
a grand total of 32 turns of wire.  Yes, you read correctly, not the hundreds
or thousands of turns you might have expected! :)  I didn't believe it the
first time I saw the transformer description either.  It takes advantage of
the flyback pulse generated when the chopper IGBT turns off boosted by the 1:1
autotransformer.
<p>
The inverter consists of a CMOS TLC555 timer and IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar
Transistor).  The IGBT is driven like a MOSFET but has output characteristics
more like that of a bipolar transistor - the best of both worlds.  The output
voltage is monitored by one section of an LM339 quad voltage comparator and
shuts off the oscillator once full charge is reached.  With the components
values for the voltage divider resistors (R14,R15,R17,R18) shown, this is
approximately 900 V.  The circuit should work for voltages up to 1 kV or more
by changing the value of the parallel combination of R17||R18.  As the voltage
decays due to leakage through the trigger circuit and voltage monitor, the
oscillator will come on briefly at periodic intervals to top off the charge.
With some minor changes, the idling current could be substantially reduced.
<p>
The other sections of the LM339 are wired as buffers to accept an inverter
ENABLE signal, provide a (low going) READY output signal, and drive a READY
LED.  The ENABLE input and READY output allow the control logic to turn on the
inverter on demand (which is fine for the intended application).  (But the
internal voltage limiter cannot be overridden.)  This reduces the idle
current consumption substantially.
<p>
The trigger circuit consists of an opto-triac driving a 10 A SCR which dumps
a 0.082 uF capacitor charged to about 300 V through the trigger transformer.
For manual triggering, these components could be replaced with a pushbutton
switch.
<p>
The PFN (Pulse Forming Network) as shown was designed to optimally drive a
8358 flashlamp with a 15 J input at less than 50 us.  The inverter itself
really doesn't care what is used for the PFN except that as designed it
charges to 900 V and how long it will take to charge the energy storage
capacitor.  This one was designed based on a Ko value for the flashlamp of
around 12.  For the SSY1, use the PFN as specified in the other SSY1 power
supply schematics or modify appropriately for your specific flashlamp and
pulse width requirements.

<h3><A NAME="sschss12">The HSS1 Inverter Transformer</A></h3>

The wonderfully simple transformer consists of two E cores of the "older"
Ferroxcube part number E375-3C81 (or even previous to that E375-3C8) and
the modern Philips Components part number E34/14/9-3C81.  The half gap (paper
thickness) is two pieces of regular copy paper which should be about
0.2 mm.  The bobbin is old Ferroxcube part number E375pcB1-12 and Philips
Components part number CPH-E34/14/9-1512.  I got them from Eastern
Components, 1-800-642-0518.
<p>
Gapped versions of this core may be available.  If both halves are gapped,
specify 0.2 mm.  If you get a gapped piece paired with an ungapped piece
then the gapped one should be 0.4 mm.
<p>
The primary and secondary are each 16 turns of insulated #20 AWG hookup wire,
but wire size is not critical and the secondary could easily be #22.  Magnet
wire is fine with adequate insulation between layers and between the secondary
and the core (3C8 and related ferrite materials are slightly conductive!), and
as thick as #18 should easily fit.

Capacitor Charger</A> for an example of the compact construction (shown sitting
on a U.S. dime).  While not quite the simplest possible design, the inverter
transformer only needs to have drive and HV output windings, no feedback
winding or tap.  Thus, it is likely that the transformer from almost any
pocket camera flash unit can be used, or one can be relatively easily
constructed.  See the section: "Ultra-Compact 350 V Capacitor Charger" in the

<h2>Wes's Ruby Laser Power Supply (WE-SP1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscwe11">Description of WE-SP1</A></h3>

This is a power supply for driving the Hughes M-60 ruby laser assmebly
available from various surplus sources and described in the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclhrl">Hughes Rangefinder Ruby Laser Assembly</A>.
WE-SP1 was designed and built by Wes Ellison
(<a href="mailto:erl@sunflower.com">erl@sunflower.com</a>).
<p>
Photos and descriptions of Wes's ruby laser assembly and WE-SP1 (as well as
of similar units and other home-built power supplies) may be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under:
"Hughes Rangefinder and Home-Built Ruby Lasers".
<p>
<ul>
<li>High voltage power supply - This consists of the capacitor charger and
 pulse forming network.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The pulse forming network is 479 J (max) using a 666 uF, 1,350 V (max)
  capacitor bank and 10 mH inductor.  A panel meter (M1) reads 1,500 V full
  scale. Note that the Pulse length is around 6 ms which appears to be several
  times what would be optimal.  If the flashlamp can handle a 1.5 ms pulse
  length without exploding, I would suggest reducing the inductor to about
  600 uH.
<p>
 <li>The capacitor charger consists of a 900 VRMS power transformer and half
  wave rectifier with current limiting resistor (R1).  The charge time
  constant is about 7 to 10 seconds with voltage topping out after about 30
  seconds.  The cycle time could be reduced substantially by using a bridge
  rectifier and lower value for R1.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Low voltage power supplies - Several voltage sources including +160 VDC
 for the trigger circuit, +24 VDC for the Q-Switch motor, and +12 VDC for the
 control circuits and relays.  I (sam) have been told that the motor is only
 rated for 20 VDC so a series resistor should be used as shown in the
 circuit in the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg4">Sam's Q-Switch
 Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby Laser (SG-ST1)</A>.
<p>
<li>Trigger - The trigger energy storage capacitor is charged from the
 +160 VDC source through a 330K ohm resistor (time constant less than .1 s).
 The SCR discharges that cap through the trigger transformer primary resulting
 in a high voltage pulse on its secondary which is applied to the anode of the
 flashlamp via blocking diodes (parallel triggering).  The Fire button enables
 triggering either immediately (Q-Switch OFF) or when a pulse arrives from the
 magnetic pickup (Q-Switch ON).
<p>
<li>Q-Switch driver - This is now a separate schematic which includes the
 switching circuit as well as the actual Q-switch driver.  As drawn, it is
 the one described in the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscsg4">Sam's
 Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby Laser (SG-ST1)</A>.  However,
 since the only connections to it are the trigger input and output (and power),
 other circuits can be easily substituted if desired.  I removed Wes's
 original Q-switch trigger circuit (in WE-SP1 V1.1 and below) since he said
 that the laser never worked in Q-switch mode using it (see below)!
<p>
<li>Overtemp lockout - If the temperature of the laser cavity (flashlamp and
 rod) goes too high, a thermister circuit activates a cooling fan and disables
 the arming/firing circuits.
<p>
<li>Automatic bleeder - When the HV power supply is deactivated, a relay
 connects a resistor across the energy storage capacitor bank to discharg it
 rapidly.
</ul>
<p>
Note that Wes was never able to get the laser to lase using his first Q-switch
driver and original resonant OC.  However, by replacing that OC with one from
another ruby laser and aligning and locking down the Q-switch prism, the laser
fired successfully without using the Q-switch.  I suspect that the inability
to make it work with the Q-switch was at least partially due to the excessively
long discharge pulse (I estimate at 6 ms) which results in insufficient
population density in the upper energy state of the ruby for the laser to
reach threshold when the Q-switch is in position.  Or, perhaps, the alignment
was never quite perfect.
<p>
Information on aligning the ruby laser optics and Q-switch can be found
in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strhrl">Aligning the Hughes Ruby Laser</A>.

 M-1 Ruby Laser.  This includes the PFN,
 capacitor charging supply, low voltage power supply, flashlamp trigger
 circuit, indicators, and overtemp lockout.
</ul>
<p>
Note: I have changed some of the part numbers so that they are unique (and
hopefully corrected some of the minor errors/duplications in the process).
The trigger circuit can be found in the next section.  The part numbers for
D3 and D4 have been swapped compared to the original drawing as
it has been pointed out that the device number for D3, NTE504, must be
an error.  The NTE504 has a peak surge current rating of only 1.5 A.  The
current through the flashlamp will be in the *hundreds* of amps.  So, the
first shot would blow that diode to bits.  So, I assume the original
labeling to be a typo since the NTE542 has a peak
surge current rating of 200 A and the diode for the trigger circuit doesn't
require a high current rating.  The NTE548 which has a 250 A surge current
rating might also be adequate but a part with an even higher rating would
be better.

<h2>Sam's Proposed Power Supply for M-60 Laser (SG-SP5)</h2>

I might get around to actually building this thing someday!
<p>
The energy storage capacitor value will be 4 x 3,600 uF at 350 V in series
with charge equalizing resistors for a net value of 875 uF derated to
1,350 V max.  Why these capacitors? Because I got a good deal on eBay!
<p>
SG-SG5 will probably be similar to WE-SP1 with the SG-ST1 Q-switch
controller.  The flashlamp energy will be adjustable, probably with some
type of regulation to assure pulse-to-pulse consistency.
<p>
Here is a possible set of switches and controls for running the laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Armed (Interlock):</b> Keylock Switch required for operation.  Disables
 bleeder and initiates capacitor charging sequence.
<p>
<li><b>Energy Adjust:</b> Knob to select from 675 to 1,350 V which
  corresponds to 200 to 800 J.
<p>
<li>Q-Switch:</b> Three position switch selects operating mode.
 <ul>
 <li><b>Off:</b> Fire button triggers flashlamp immediately (non-Q-switch
  mode).
<p>
 <li><b>Single Shot (Normal mode):</b> Fire button spins up motor and
  triggers flashlamp based on position sensor delay.  Motor then turns off.
<p>
 <li><b>Continuous:</b> Motor runs continuously.  Fire button triggers
  flashlamp based on position sensor delay.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Fire button:</b> Initiates firing sequence.
<p>
<li><b>Charge Complete Override:</b> Determines whether energy storage
 capacitors must be fully charged for Fire button to have an effect.
 <ul>
 <li><b>Off (Normal):</b> Fire button only triggers flashlamp if capacitor
  voltage is at least equal to voltage setpoint.
<p>
 <li><b>On:</b> Fire button triggers (or attempts to trigger) flashlamp
  regardless of capacitor voltage.
 </ul>

<h2>Sam's Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby Laser (SG-ST1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscsg41">Description and Schematic of SG-ST1</A></h3>

Having looked at all the designs for this circuit I finally decided that it
was time to do it properly. :)  So, I have combined the best features of
the circuits from Wes and Doug into a version that is free of the logical
hazards that I believe are present in the others while providing electrical
adjustment of the timing delay, and avoidance of false triggering when
switching modes.  The only connections besides power to a system like the
one described in the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscwe1">Wes's Ruby Laser
Power Supply (WE-SP1)</A> are the trigger input and output signals (TRGIN-H
and TRGOUT-H respectively).  This circuit is installed between the original
trigger switch or external trigger signal and the input to the firing SCR.
<p>
With the long fluorescence lifetime of ruby - about 3 ms - timing of the
Q-switch is not as critical as it is for Nd:YAG with its much shorter
fluorescence lifetime (230 us).  The Q-switch motor spins at 30,000
rpm or 500 rps for a period of 2 ms.  So, if the flash duration is
resaonably short compared to 2 ms, there will be a high probability of
a decent output energy even if the flashlamp was triggered at random
relative to the Q-switch position!  Even if the flash duration is as
long as 3 ms, half the time, more than 50 percent of the available
energy will have been transferred to the rod when the Q-switch is
triggered.  This is probably the main reason that faulty Q-switch
trigger circuits seemed to produce successful results, though I bet
the variation in energy due to the timing not always being optimal
remained a mystery and was probably attributed to other causes.
However, with a proper design, the pulse energy should be quite
consistent.
<p>
The diagram is available in PDF format:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="sgst1sch.pdf">SG-ST1-SCH</A> -
 Sam's Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby Laser.  This
 includes the buffer for the Q-switch magnetic sensor, 555 timer used as
 adjustable delay, single pulse generating syncrhonizer, and mode select
 and Q-switch motor power switch.
</ul>
<p>
SG-ST1 consists of several parts:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Mode select switch (S1) provides two sets of output: Q-switch motor power
 and Q-switch enable (QSEBL-H) and its complement (QSEBL-L).
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>In the 'OFF' position, the Q-switch motor is unpowered and the single
  pulse generating synchronizer flip flops (U2) are forced to be reset.  The
  trigger input (TRGIN-H) is applied directly to the output buffer and thus
  directly to the firing SCR.
<p>
 <li>In the 'ON' position, the Q-switch motor is powered and the pulse
  generating synchronizer flip flops (U2) are enabled.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Q-switch magnetic pickup buffer and activity LED (Q1/IL1).  the
 input from the magnetic sensor should be via shielded cable to prevent
 noise pickup, especially from the Q-switch motor.
<p>
<li>A 555 timer (U1) set up as a 10 to 100 us adjustable delay.  When the
 Q-switch motor is running, its output will be a pulse train at about 500 Hz
 with a pulse width equal to the selected delay.
<p>
<li>Q2 is a clock buffer/inverter - I didn't want to have to add another chip!
 The trailing edge of the 555's output will have the correct timing
 relationship with the input pulse.
<p>
<li>The 74LS74 (U2) is a single pulse generating synchronizer.  The FIRE
 button (S2) or external trigger input clocks U2A setting its Q output high.
 This is synchronized to the delayed Q-switch pulse by U2B.  When U2B's Q
 output goes high, the SCR in the main power supply is triggered firing the
 flashlamp.  At the same time, U2A is reset and U2B returns to the low state
 one clock period later.  The actual pulse to the SCR is coupled though a
 capacitor so it is only a few dozen microseconds long.  U2 guarantees that
 the pulse to fire the SCR occurs at exactly the right time and is of
 sufficient length.  This cannot be done with just combinatorial gates as
 in some of the other circuits!
<p>
<li>The 74LS00 (U3) is used to multiplex the direct trigger input (Q-switch
 OFF) or output of U2B (Q-switch ON), and to force the reset state for U2.
 Much of this complexity is needed to prevent accidental triggering of the
 flashlamp when switching modes.  If you don't care about this elegance,
 just use the part of S1 that generates the QSEBL signals as a select between
 U2B-Q and TRGIN-H.  U3 then goes away completely.
</ul>

Note that this circuit will only work where a delay is expected between the
pulse from the magnetic sensor and the firing of the flashlamp.  As originally
adjusted, there is expected to be 0 delay with clockwise rotation of the
Q-switch prism.  For use with this circuit, the best option is to reposition
the Q-switch assembly by loosening the mounting screws (but this may require
some optical alignment).  It should be moved about 10 degrees counter-clockwise
resulting in a 55 us earlier trigger point at 30,000 rpm.  This will be around
the middle of the 555 delay adjustment range.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclhrlq">Notes on the Q-Switch</A> for more information.
<p>
To obtain a continuous stream of properly timed output pulses, <b>WITH THE
HIGH VOLTAGE OFF!</b>, jumper the output of the 555 (pin 3) to TRGIN-H with
External Trigger Input selected.  (CAUTION: Selecting Internal Trigger Input
would short out this signal!)  TRGOUT-H will then be a squarewave at one
half the Q-switch motor rotation rate where the rising edges coincide with
the SCR trigger point.

<h2>Doug's Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby Laser (DL-ST1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscdl11">Description and Schematic of DL-ST1</A></h3>

The <A HREF="dlst1sch.gif">Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby
Laser</A> uses multiple 555 timers to provide an adjustable delay and
trigger pulse to fire the SCR in the M-60 Ruby Laser PFN assembly.  It should
also work fine with other trigger circuits requiring a positive pulse for
activation or, with minor modifications, other configurations.
<p>
The advantage of using 555 timers is their low cost and availability even
from Radio Shack.  TTL or CMOS monostables (one-shots) could be substituted
with a slight reduction in parts count.
<p>
Note that this circuit will only work where a delay is expected between the
pulse from the magnetic sensor and the firing of the flashlamp.  As originally
adjusted, there is expected to be 0 delay for clockwise rotation of the
Q-switch prism.  Ways around this are either to run the motor in reverse
and delay almost the entire rotation period (but without a PLL or other means
of speed stabilization, this may result in too much variability in timing
due to the long delay required) or to reposition the Q-switch assembly by
loosening the mounting screws (requiring optical alignment.)  See the section:

<h2>Andreiko's Q-Switch Trigger Circuit for Hughes M-60 Ruby Laser
 (AK-ST1)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscak11">Description and Schematic of AK-ST1</A></h3>

(From: Andreiko Kerdemelidis (andreiko@keyghost.com).)
<p>
The circuit shown in <A HREF="akst1sch.gif">Q-Switch Synchronizer and Firing
Circuit for M-60 Rangefinder Ruby Laser</A> and described below is a simple
and complete solution that can be used to run it with the addition of a
1,200 V power supply.  The only specialized components are the saturable
core trigger transformer, which can be easily wound by hand.
<p>
When I purchased the laser, it still had its stock flash tube, the FX-103C-3
but was missing the collimator. I use a bank of 12 low ESR electrolytics
(Marcon 400 V, 470 uF) to give me a 660 uF, 1200 V capacitor bank. When firing
the tube, be sure to use at least 1,000 V across the capacitor bank, this
seems to be the lasing threshold for this arrangement.
<p>
The synchronizer uses the common CD4528 CMOS dual monostable chip. One of the
monostables in the chip is used as the delay element, and the other provides a
signal to fire the flashlamp, via the opto-isolator. It is a very simple
circuit, but it is very reliable, and will not fire the lamp unless the fire
button is pressed. I would also recommend an interlock switch between the
opto-isolator LED and the 4528, as a further safety precaution. The circuit
around the CS549 is a rectifier and buffer for the sensor, (and also simple
inverter) to trigger the delay monostable. Pressing the fire switch activates
the monostables by pulling the clear pins high and the first pulse received
from the sensor sets the delay running. This delay is set by R3, the 10 turn
200 K variable resistor. When the first monostable delay finishes, the
high-to-low transition is sent to the inverting input of the trigger shot
monostable, which then pulses the opto-isolator for a short time, and thus
triggers the SCR. This discharges the 0.1uF cap into the series injection
transformer, and triggers the flashlamp.
<p>
The series injection trigger transformer/PFN is reasonably important, so here
is a basic description of how the design was coined. I was after about 8-10KV
for the flashlamp to trigger, and also a fast-rising pulse.  I calculated 24 x
350 V = 8,400 V should be enough turns. I used litz wire because it was lying
around, and had a 2 KV insulation but it probably wouldn't do any harm to use
normal, well insulated, copper wire either. The core used was a Siemens RM-14
core of N-87 ferrite material.  I first wound 24 turns of the litz wire onto
the centre of the core, it came to 2 layers, between which I insulated with
capton tape. A single turn was then wound over the top of this coil, which was
made of 4 sections of litz wire laid flat and soldered together. This was
further insulated with capton tape. The core was assembled over the windings
without any air gap, so as to saturate quickly when the lamp fired. An
additional inductor may also be used in series with the lamp as part of the
PFN if you want to try and further tune the pulse shape for the flashlamp (I
didn't find that an inductor was required, though). If you find that the lamp
doesn't trigger, swap the wires going into the single turn around.
<p>
To tune the synchroniser, put an LED in place of the opto-isolator input, and
short the 330 ohm series resistor (this will yield a brighter flash from the
LED). The motor is spun up with 12 to 15 VDC. This gives about 24,000 RPM, or
420 us/rotation. In a darkened room, bring the LED close to the top of the
prism (VERY CAREFULLY SO AS NOT TO HIT THE SPINNING PRISM - THIS CAN DAMAGE THE
OPTICS). The triangular glass surface of the prism perpendicular to the motor
shaft has been ground, and gives a good surface to shine the LED and look at
when adjusting the delay. When the firing switch is pressed and held down,
with the LED close to the prism, the prism appears to freeze and I then turned
the 200K tuning pot (see schematic) until the prism was frozen about 5 degrees
before the resonator would align, to allow for the flashlamp trigger delay,
and also for the offset required for the Q-switch to do its Q-switching. I
then put the opto back into the circuit and charged the capacitors to
1,050 V. I spun up the motor with 15V, and hit the fire button. A piece of blue
paper was the target. It worked first time, discolouring the paper, but it was
not very powerful. To further tune it, I kept charging the supply and firing
it, while adjusting the 10 turn delay tuning pot between shots. It took about
8 shots to tune it as well as I could. I have to admit that it seems to be
putting out two beams for some reason, when it it was tuned well, but I think
that this is because I removed the output coupler early on (very dumb thing to
do) before managing to get the laser working. It still lases well though.

<h2>Power Supply for Micro YAG Laser (uYAG)</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sscuyagd">Description of uYAG PSU</A></h3>

The system described in the paper 
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lr/">Micro-Laser Range Finder</A> uses
a small (approximately 25 mm x 3 mm) Nd:YAG rod pumped by the flash unit from
a Kodak MAX disposable (single-use) 35 mm camera.  This essentially free
device has some nice features including energy storage capacitor voltage
regulation, a clean PCB layout, and operation from a single 1.5 V AA size
Alkaline cell.
<p>
Less than a dozen small electronic components need to be added to the original
circuit (I placed most of them on a 1 square inch mezzanine board) and the
thin chrome plated aluminum flashlamp reflector can easily be reformed to
enclose the Nd:YAG rod providing for very efficient energy transfer.  Thus,
the entire uYAG laser can be constructed in a case less than 1/4 the volume
of the original MAX camera!
<p>
Depending on the design of the cavity optics, less than 5 joules should be
sufficient to threshold a YAG rod of this size (1/8th the volume of SSY1).
Therefore, depending on your objectives, it may be possible to substitute a
smaller energy stroage capacitor resulting in longer battery life and shorter
cycle time.  Alternatively, for maximum output pulse energy, using a higher
quality (non-electrolytic) energy storage capacitor and pulse forming
inductor may be desirable.  However, I'll leave it up to you to determine
the explosion energy and thus safe range of operating energies and pulse
durations.  See the other chapters on SS lasers.

<h3><A NAME="sscuyagi">MAX Flash Interface and Circuit Modifications</A></h3>

The following is just a summary.  More detailed information can be found in
the links, above.
<p>
Circuitry was added to control the 1.5 V to 300 V inverter, sense when the
capacitor is fully charged, and fire the flashlamp.  The circuit changes were
designed to take advantage of the way the MAX operated as part of the camera
and to minimize rework to its printed circuit board.  Where a new board is to
be fabbed, the latter is not an issue but it turned out that this approach was
still more-or-less optimal.
<p>
Here are descriptions of the control and status signals:
<p>
<ul>
<li>OPR-H: This logic signal controls the inverter:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>RUN: (TTL High, 2 to 5 V) -> Inverter starts and runs but may be
   overridden by the OFF signal or built-in 300 V limiter.
 <p>
 <li>CRUISE: (Open, Hi-Z or Tri-Stated) -> No Change.  Inverter will continue
   running or remain off as determined by previous state.
 <p>
 <li>STOP: (TTL Low, 0 to .4 V) -> Inverter stops.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>OFF-H: This logic signal disables the inverter regardless of state of OPR.
<p>
<li>FIRE-P: This pulse signal will trigger the flash on either edge with a
  sufficiently powerful driver (assuming the energy storage capacitor is
  charged).
<p>
<li>READY-L: This output can be used as either a digital indication of full
  charge or an analog monitor of the energy storage capacitor (C1) voltage
  in the approximate range of 305 to 310 VDC.
</ul>
<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/mmaxsch.gif">Modified MAX Flash Unit
Schematic</A> when reading the following discussion.
<p>
Operation of the OPR signal for RUN and CRUISE is analogous to the original
charge push-button of the MAX camera: A TTL high is the same as pressing the
button while OPEN is like releasing the button.  The addition of a diode (D8)
allows a solid TTL low or ground to such enough current out of the drive
circuit to kill inverter oscillation.
<p>
The OFF signal drives the base of Q5 which similarly shorts out the drive to
stop oscillation.
<p>
The FIRE signal is capacitively coupled to the gate of the triac, Q6, to
discharge the trigger capacitor, C3.  This is exactly analogous to the
way the original shutter contacts worked.
<p>
An additional circuit, very similar to that of the 300 V limiter, was added
for the READY status signal.  Its input is derived from the energy storage
capacitor through the same high voltage neon bulb (IL1) and zener (ZD2) so
it turns on at around 300 V.  It was found necessary to add a sneak path
prevention diode, D9, to block voltage making its way in from the TTL supply
and restarting the inverter even if OPR was open.

<h2>Other SS Laser Power Supplies on the Web</h2>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.halted.com/">Halted Specialties, Co</A> used to have
 a power supply for the Hughes M-60 ruby laser on their Web site but it
 has disappeared.  Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on your point
 of view!) I have it archived at
 <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/laserps1.gif">Raymond's Ruby
 Laser Power Supply</A>.
 (I would give more contact info for the designer, Raymond, but I couldn't
 read the hand printing on the schematic.)  It uses a basic half-wave
 power transformer based capacitor charger with a capacitor bank made from
 16 220 uF, 400 V electrolytics in a 4x4 array, a 120 uH PFN inductor, and
 parallel pulse triggering requiring an 18 kV blocking diode which is made
 from 108 (!!) 1N4007s in a 6x18 array.
<p>
 While for the most part, this power supply will get the job done, it is
 overly complex.  At the very least, a more rational choice of components
 would result in a much cleaner more reliable design.  However, there is
 at least one problem: If the power transformer in the capacitor charger is
 really rated at 1,200 VRMS, applying full line voltage to it would result
 in excessive voltage on the capacitor bank.  Thus, a Variac or other means
 reducing its output voltage or some other modifications would be needed to
 prevent fireworks.

 A suitable power supply for the Hughes ruby laser (or a similar one) using
 a proven design can be built that is both simpler and includes a driver for
 the Hughes ruby laser Q-switch as well as additional safety features.  See
 the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscwe1">Wes's Ruby Laser Power Supply
 (WE-SP1)</A>.

 Of course, if you (or the guy who designed this) had a stock of 220 uF, 400 V
 caps left over from another project, sure, go for it!  In conjunction with
 typical electrolytic caps, the 120 uH inductor would result in a pulse
 duration of about 750 us which should be safe for the FX-103C-3 (or
 equivalent) flashlamp.

 And, I hope you like to do lots of soldering!
