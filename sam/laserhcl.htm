<h2>Introduction</h2>

This chapter has information on common commercial HeNe lasers with internal
or external mirrors that do not have active stabilization, which is the
vast majority of common models both in current production, and of historical
interest.  Information on stabilized HeNe lasers (which includes those
used in metrology) has been moved to a new chapter:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsttoc">Commercial Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A>.
<p>
For current production lasers, the manufacturers' Web sites often provide
basic specifications.  For older lasers, it's often difficult to obtain
detailed specs so estimates based on physical size, and then testing may
be the only option.
<p>
The sections in this chapter are arranged approximately in alphabetical
order by manufacturer.

<h2>Coherent HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.cohr.com/">Coherent, Inc.</A> used to be a large
supplier of HeNe lasers but haven't manufactured any new HeNe
lasers for quite awhile.  They sold a limited selection of Melles Griot
lasers under their own name.  Only the label differed, and sometimes theirs
was just pasted over the Melles Griot label.  But
as of April, 2006, Coherent isn't even doing this anymore and simply
refers customers to <A HREF="http://www.lasers.mellesgriot.com/">Melles
Griot Lasers</A>.

<h3><A NAME="hclcohh">Coherent HeNe Laser Heads</A></h3>

These are just a few random part numbers for HeNe laser heads with Coherent,
Inc. labels.  They are all actually manufactured by
Melles Griot.  Everything about them is identical except for the manufacturer
name and model number printed on the label.  Aside from very minor differences
that may be typos (mine or theirs), the specifications listed on the Coherent
Web site also match.  In fact, something about the label on one laser head I
recently acquired seemed strage and indeed, there were two stickers on top
of one-another.  Peeling off the top Coherent label revealed, guess what?: A
Melles Griot label with the same serial number but the MG part number! :)

<h2>Melles Griot HeNe Laser Tubes and Heads</h2>

The following data came from a variety of sources including an old Melles
Griot brochure, their 1999 catalog, and the
<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> Web Site.
<p>
All Melles Griot HeNe laser tubes are hard-sealed with essentially unlimited
shelf life - 12 years is quoted but for all practical purposes, it is
infinite.  Most standard tubes have a planar HR mirror with a concave OC
mirror with its curvature selected for maximum stability.  This long radius
hemispherical cavity configuration puts the beam waist at the HR
with a slightly diverging beam from the OC.  But a compensating curvature
on the outer surface of the OC mirror of most laser tubes that are sold
as or in standard products results in a positive lens and the beam
that exits the laser is quite well collimated.  (Specific applications
like barcode scanning may call for a divergence other than the minimum
possible to avoid the need for an additional external lens.)
<p>
And in the "I always wondered about that" department, the correct way to
pronouce Melles Griot is
<p>
<blockquote>
 MEL-liss (emphasis on the first syllable).<br>
 GREE-o (emphasis on the first syllable).
</blockquote>
<p>
This was confirmed both by someone who knew Jan Melles and Richard Griot
personally, and from a VP at Melles Griot.  But apparently, some of their
employees don't even get it right. :)

<h3><A NAME="hclmgrd">Melles Griot Red HeNe Laser Tubes</A></h3>

These are all red (632.8 nm) tubes operating single longitudinal mode (TEM00)
except for models 185, 981, 831, which are multimode (and thus produce much
higher power for their size).  Many are actually sold as part of complete
laser heads (most of the model numbers shown are actually for the laser head
if it is an odd number, physical specs are for just the tube).
<p>
The following data came from a variety of sources including an old Melles
Griot brochure, the 1999 catalog, and the
<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A> Web site.  Go to
"Product Info", "Lasers", "HeNe" or more directly to
<A HREF="http://lasers.mellesgriot.com/">Melles
Griot Lasers</A>, "Helium-Neon (HeNe)".  Then click on any location.
<p>
This is not a complete list but probably includes most of those you're likely
to come across.

<p>
Notes:
<ol>
<li>Models beginning with a "0" are typically designated for barcode scanning
 applications and have metal end-caps (both ends).  They are all TEM00 but the
 divergence in some cases may be larger than what is possible (and usually
 provided) due to the specific requirements of the intended application.
 The increased divergence is produced either by grinding the outer surface
 of the output mirror with a concave curvature, or by an external negative
 lens cemented in place.
<p>
 LHR models are random polarized; LHP models are linearly polarized.  Not all
 model numbers have both versions.  Barcode scanning tubes are nearly all
 only available random polarized.
<p>
 For lower power lasers, models ending in an even number are often (but
 not always) a bare tube, with the corresponding head being the same number
 incremented by (or ORed with) 1.  For high power lasers, the laser
 head number is listed.
<p>
<li>Model 05-LHR-002-246 is a cute little tube that was found in a hand-held
 bar code scanner (Metrologic model MH290).  The 05-LHR-007 and 05-LHR-640
 above it are a close runner-up in the cuteness area though.  There is also
 a model 05-LHR-001, even smaller being about 12 mm x 100 mm, which has a
 very short life and is only rated for intermittent operation, possibly due to
 its very small cathode area and gas reservoir.
<p>
<li>Models with a mode spacing of "NA-MM" run with multiple transverse modes
 (not TEM00) and therefore, they don't have a mode spacing specifications
 since the mode spacing differs slightly for each of the multiple modes.
 They output greater power for their size compared to TEM00 tubes and may be
 used for applications like light shows but are unsuitable for holography and
 interferometry.
<p>
<li>Most laser heads are metal cylinders except for the highest power models
 (35 mW) which are now rectangular to assure the proper orientation for
 maximum output power and improve stability.  They simply mount a cylinder
 inside a rectangular case.  Gravity affects the bore ever so slightly but
 worse for long lasers and this means that there is a small but noticeable
 dependence on orientation with long HeNe lasers.  Also, the power stability
 is more dependent on mounting and temperature effects.
</ol>
<p>
The operating voltage across the tube itself can be found by subtracting the
voltage drop across the ballast resistor (I*Rb), from the value listed in the
table.  Actual starting voltages are typically 3 to 5 times the tube operating
voltage (though the specifications may be higher).  Note that I've assumed
a 75K ballast resistance for all tubes.  The actual manufacturer recomendation
may differ slightly but 75K should be acceptable for most.
<p>
Both random (LHR) and linearly polarized (LHP) models are available for
most of the lasers listed above.  The only other
difference in specifications for red HeNe lasers between these is their
price - about 10 to 15 percent higher for a complete polarized laser.  So
you can imagine the difference in the tube cost alone since everything
else is identical.  (The output power of "other-color" linearly polarized
HeNe lasers compared to similar size random polarized models, particularly
for yellow and green which have very low gain, tends to be much less since
the losses through the internal Brewster plate become more significant.)
<p>
And speaking of prices, if you have to ask, you can't afford a new HeNe
laser!  But since you asked, prices (Summer 2002) from Melles Griot vary
from around $300 for a 0.5 mW laser head to over $4,000 for one rated at
35 mW (power supply sold separately)!  Prices in Summer 2005

<h3><A NAME="hclmgoc">Melles Griot Other Color HeNe Laser Tubes</A></h3>

The following "other-color" HeNe tubes have been listed in various Melles
Griot catalogs.  These are all single mode (TEM00), random polarized, unless
otherwise noted.  Linearly polarized versions are also available
(e.g., yellow would be LYP instead of LYR for those models where this
option is available).  However, due to the lower gain of most of the
"other color" lasing lines, most of the linearly polarized tubes for
these wavelengths have much lower output power than physically similar
randomly polarized models due to the additional cavity losses introduced
by the Brewster plate.  (For red tubes, the power outputs are usually
identical.)  Also note that the output power of these laser in general
is much much less than that of the red (632.8 nm) models with similar
(in some cases identical) dimensions.  Due to the lower gas fill pressure
used in at least the yellow and green tubes, their operating life is much
shorter than that of red ones - something not advertised for obvious reasons.

Note: Some of the listed values for divergence in particular appear to be
questionable.  For example, for the same beam diameter, diffraction limited
divergence should be proportional to wavelength.  The discrepency for the
3,391 nm IR tube is particularly striking.  Either the divergence or beam
diameter are almost certainly incorrect.  It probably doesn't matter much
though because the 3,391 nm model is no longer manufactured.  I also
suspect the output power rating for the 05-LGR-171 may be a bit higher
than listed in the source for this information.

<h3><A NAME="hclmgbw">Melles Griot Brewster and Zero Degree Window HeNe
 Tubes</A></h3>

Here are abbreviated specs for some Melles Griot one and two-Brewster window
HeNe tubes and one and two 0 degree (perpendicular?) window HeNe tubes.  The
Brewster angle is probably optimal for 632.8 nm.  Window tubes may be used
where external adjustment of the polarization is required and for educational
purposes where either a linearly or random polarized beam is desired in an
external mirror laser.  Power outputs below are for matched optics.  Your
mileage may vary using mirrors from your junk box!

<p>
The most common application for one-Brewster HeNe tubes was probably for
particle counting since by using an external high quality HR mirror, the
intracavity flux can be several <i>watts</i> which makes a speck of anything
stand out!  (Some large one-Brewster HeNe tubes can do as much as 100 W
intracavity, not these!).  Passing the air/gas/whatever flow through the
cavity of a one-Brewster HeNe laser is similar to passing it through the
output beam of a high power laser - at a fraction of the cost (and it's
much safer as well since if anything macroscopic in size (like an eyeball
or piece of paper) were to block the intracavity beam, lasing simply stops
with no damage to vision and no risk of fire!
<p>
The LHB models all have HR mirrors that are probably optimal for 632.8 nm
(red) though newer versions, at least, may be quite broadband and better than
99.9 percent from 590 to 680 nm so operation at some of the non-632.8 nm
wavelengths may be possible.  However, older versions may not have such nice
HRs.
<p>
Other variations on these tubes are also produced (though they may be special
order).  I was given an 05-LGB-580 which has an HR optimized for 543.5 nm
(green).  With an external green HR, the behavior is very similar to the red
version but with loads of circulating green photons instead of red ones. :)
I was told that this tube may have been made for the sole purpose of confirming
the quality of the mirrors to be used in normal internal mirror HeNe laser
tubes.  So, I doubt you could buy 1.  Maybe 1,000, but not just 1!
Applications for such a tube would be very limited due to the low gain
as it stops lasing entirely in a few minutes after cleaning the optics
just due to dust settling on the B-window.
<p>
The 05-LHB-370, 05-LHB-570, 05-LHB-670, and 05-LHB-580 have wide bores and
generally operate with multiple transverse modes to achieve maximum
intracavity power in particle counting applications.  The 05-LHB-270 and
05-LHB-290 have narrow bores like most conventional HeNe tubes.  (The
05-LHB-270 appears physically similar to an 05-LHR-120 except for the Brewster
window at one end.)  The model 05-LHB-570 is the one-Brewster HeNe tube used
in the CLIMET 9048 one-Brewster laser head described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henoneb">A One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube</A>.  You can't
tell from the model numbers but both Melles Griot and Hughes style designs
may be used.  For example, the 05-LHB-570 looks like a normal Melles Griot
tube but with a Brewster angle window frit sealed to the metal end-cap instead
of an OC mirror.  The 05-LHB-580 looks like a Hughes style tube, but with an
optically contacted Brewster window instead of an OC mirror (though some
Hughes style polarized HeNe tubes are just one-Brewster tubes with an OC
mirror attached to a glass tube that slips over the Brewster stem and is
itself glued in place).  Thus, the 05-LHB-580 is actually a much higher
quality (and more expensive) tube than the 05-LHB-570 but you can't tell
this from the catalog listing! Here are diagrams of each type:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="onebrew2.gif">Melles Griot Style One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube
 Mounted in Test Fixture</A> shows a Melles Griot 05-LHB-570 configured with
 the OC mirror from a Spectra-Physics model 084-1 barcode scanner HeNe tube.
<p>
<li><A HREF="onebrew3.gif">Hughes Style One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube
 Mounted in Test Fixture</A> shows a Melles Griot 05-LGB-580 (green, see
 above!) configured with a matching external HR mirror.
</ul>
<p>
One possible explanation of why the Hughes style design is used for the high
quality tubes with optically contacted Brewster windows is that since Hughes
already produced HeNe tubes with a glass Brewster stem (as noted above),
when Melles Griot took over the Hughes HeNe laser product line, making the
modifications for the graded seal to accommodate the fused silica Brewster
stem (needed to match the expansion coefficient of the fused silica
window) was probably easier than starting with a metal end-cap.

<p>
Rather than mirrors, one or both ends of these HeNe tubes have optical flats
with very high quality AR coatings to permit the use of external mirrors.
One advantage of this arrangement is that external optics can be used to
control polarization (the output beam of Brewster tubes is always linearly
polarized and can't be changed).
<p>
The 05-WHR-252 and 05-WHR-183 appear to be identical except for the number
of windows - and the loss of 2 mW with the two window version!

<h3><A NAME="hclmthl1">Metrologic Military Laser Head</A></h3>

This isn't really a commercial HeNe laser but is still showing up as
military surplus from places like <A HREF="http://www.herbach.com/">Herback
and Rademan (H&R)</A> and on eBay.
<p>
The actual markings on a typical unit are:

</PRE>
<p>
There is no doubt this is a military laser.  It is a machined stainless
steel cylinder about 1.75 inches in diameter by 14 inches in length, with
a precision welded flange at the connector-end.  (See the photo on the H&R
Web site.)  It weighs in at over 3 pounds!
The tube is potted in a rubbery material which completely fills
the entire length of the cylinder with the HV connections via a pair
of female contacts.  There is no physical difference between the anode and
cathode terminals but they are labeled "P1+" and "P2", respectively.
<p>
So, you'd think that this laser has to be at least 5 mW, right?  Wrong!
What's inside appears to be a 9 or 10 inch tube rated at about 1 mW with
a TEM00, random polarized beam.  The tube is long enough that polarization
variations due to mode cycling are relatively small.  The
sample I have produces about 1.4 mW.  It runs best on about 5 mA at
1,250 V, but remains stable down to about 2 mA.  The internal
ballast resistor is at least 90K ohms (might be a bit larger).  So, almost
any HeNe laser power supply designed for a 1 to 2 mW laser should be
suitable.  H&R recomends their model G7-001 but their much cheaper
TM91LSR1495 works fine, and the typical barcode scanner brick would
probably be adequate as well even though the current is generally
lower (3 to 3.5 mA).
<p>
I don't know if the tube is simply a barcode scanner tube in a fancy 
expensive package, or one of Metrologic's "hard seal steel ceramic
tubes" that were introduced around 1980.  Those seem to have had
a rather short life cycle since the higher cost might only be justified in,
well, military applications. :)  And, much cheaper glass tubes with
frit-seals - what we know and love today - came along about the same
time.  By 1987, modern tube construction we well developed and soft
seals had faded into history for most HeNe lasers.  Someone I know
tried a medical X-ray machine on the head cylinder
without success.  Gouging out all the potting material and ruining
the magnificent packaging would hardly be justified to simply find a
common barcode scanner tube inside!  With the laser powered (to provide
internal illumination), I tried looking
in the output-end through a dielectric filter that blocked 633 nm and I
think there was glass visible inside but it was hard to tell.  The side
of the mirror looks somewhat strange but maybe that's just because it is
coated with the rubber potting compound.
<p>
On the H&R Web site, this laser is listed as a "Ruggedized HeNe Laser Head"
used for some sort of weapons training/sighting application.  It would also
make a decent hammer.  If there is a steel ceramic Metrologic tube inside,
hammering nails probably wouldn't affect its lasing performance
at all.  I'd love to know how much one of these beauties cost
the American taxpayer. :-)

<h2>Research Electro-Optics Tunable HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.reoinc.com/">Research Electro-Optics, Inc. (REO)</A>
is probably the only manufacturer of commercially available HeNe lasers
that can be tuned to 5 wavelengths by turning a knob.  (They also manufacture
more conventional internal mirror HeNe lasers including beams in all the
usual decorator colors :) as well as a couple of dual wavelength models.
<p>
Here are some specifications for two REO tunable lasers.  Both of these models
were listed in their 1992 catalog though only the LSTP-1010 shows up in a
recent listing.  As expected, both are linearly polarized (500:1) since they
use a Littrow tuning prism external to the laser tube:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The LSTP-0010 produces 0.1 mW at 543.5 nm, 0.3 mW at 594.1 nm, 0.5 mW at
 604.6 nm, 0.5 mW at 611.9 nm, and 0.5 mW at 632.8 nm.  Price: $3,200.
<p>
<li>The LSTP-1010 produces 0.3 mW at 543.5 nm, 0.6 mW at 594.1 nm, 0.5 mW at
 604.6 nm, 2.5 mW at 611.9 nm, and 4 mW at 632.8 nm.  Price: $4,050.
</ul>
<p>
Note the line at 604.6 nm (orange/yellow) which is almost never seen in other
other-color HeNe lasers (at least it isn't supposed to be there). :)  A new
LSTP-1010 with careful cleaning and alignment may actually produce more than
3 times the spec'd power for 543.5 nm, 594.1 nm, and 604.6 nm.
<p>
One or more of the other visible HeNe wavelengths may also be present
in some samples.  I've seen one with a small amount of 629.4 nm
and heard of another that produces almost 1 mW or 640.1 nm.  These
are just not guaranteed in the specifications but may result from
subtle variations in the mirror coating wavelength reflectivity functions
for the Littrow prism and OC.
<p>
There was also an LSTP-0050 which should have similar wavelength specs but
the output powers are unknown.
<p>
And for only $4,050.00 plus shipping and handling, you can now buy
your very own LSTP-1010 through <A HREF="http://www.edmundoptics.com/">Edmund
Industrial Optics</A> and elsewhere. :)
<p>
These lasers show up on eBay from time-to-time but are almost invariably
dead or dying, though I know of one instance where such a laser turned out
to work on all lines at near rated power after some tender loving care.
(Apparently, its power supply had died so the laser was put on the shelf
for who knows how long, but the tube recovered after being run for many
hours.)  A PMS tunable laser from 1984 is physically similar to the REO
version sold today (2007).  However, the Littrow prism has been improved
and the heater on the OC mirror has been eliminated.
Installing a new tube in an old case is possible but will probably
not result in quite the same performance as a new laser.  The output power
for all lines will not be as high as with a new prism and the green line in
particular could be down right whimpy. :)  Even so, the laser may still
exceed the LSTP-1010 specifications (at least initially), though possibly
just barely for the green line.  However, there may be surprises like
some 640.1 nm or 629.4 nm due to differences in the coatings.
Of course, since it's likely that a new tube will likely be almost
as expensive as a new laser, a tube swap is not going to be cost effective.
<p>
Some photos (from Dave):
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="reolstp1.jpg">A Pair of REO/PMS LSTP Tunable HeNe Lasers</A>.  The
 one on the left is brand new from REO in 2006 while the physically identical
 one on the right is at least 20 years old from PMS.  This is the one that
 was obtained on eBay dead and nursed back to health.
<p>
<li><A HREF="reolstp2.jpg">Interior of REO/PMS LSTP Tunable HeNe Laser</A>
 shows the relatively simple construction in a top view.  The mostly
 metal HeNe laser tube is clamped above the power supply brick.  A pair of
 ceramic magnets can be seen glued along side the tube.   (Note how someone
 used one of the magnets as a convenient place to park a pair of screws!)
 The magnets increase the output power by about 10 to 25 percent for the
 non-red lines.  The Littrow prism is under the black cover at the right
 with the transverse adjustment knob just visible.
<p>
<li><A HREF="reolstp3.jpg">Closeup of Brewster Window and Littrow Prism in
 REO LSTP Tunable HeNe Laser</A>.  Normally, a tight fitting cover seals
 this area as shown in the above photo.  This is the newer style rectangular
 prism.  There is another photo below that shows the older one.  The shape
 difference is probably to reduce costs rather than to improve preformance
 though.  A rectangular prism can be polished as a long strip and then cut
 into smaller pieces.
</ul>
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).) 
<p>
The five lines are 543.5, 594.1, 604.6, 611.9, and the common (red) 632.8 nm.
You might see a flash at 629.4 nm and at 640.1 nm, but nothing to write home
about. The 629 and 640 nm lines are so weak, and so close to 633 that they're
sometimes hard to distinguish.  There should be nothing at the IR lines (1,153,
1,523 or 3,391 nm).
<p>
As originally designed, these lasers used a Brewster window tube with a Littrow
prism as the wavelength selection mechanism.  The tube's internal mirror was a
broad band output coupler.  Don't know if it's changed, but I doubt it.  
(Same in 2007. --- Sam.)
<p>
The fundamental design issue is that the optimum Bore-to-Mode Ratio (BMR) for
green is much higher than for red. (BMR is the ratio of limiting aperture
size to mode radius.  To get TEM00 operation for green, the optimal number
is about 4.2, for red it's about 3.5.)  If you know the wavelength, mirror
curvature, and spacing, you can calculate the mode radius at any point in
the cavity. The capillary bore serves as the limiting aperture, so adjusting
bore length and bore diameter sets the BMR, which in turn determines
transverse mode purity.
<p>
Thus, if you optimize the BMR for green power (which you have to do), the red
is under-apertured, and has something like 50% off-axis modes.  It's getting
close to a doughnut-mode.  
<p>
REO builds some of the highest 'Q' Brewster tubes in the world (probably
<b>THE</b> highest), exclusively for the company, Particle Measuring Systems
(PMS). REO and PMS used to be one in the same, but the owner sold off the
particle counter biz a few years back, for something like $75 million. They
now have some sort of supply agreement.  The REO tubes aren't the most robust
or mechanically stable, but if you get them packaged right, probably some of
the highest power you can get from a given tube length.  This is mostly due to
coatings (all Ion Beam Sputtered), and a super-polishing process they have for
substrates.  As they say, it's all done with mirrors. ;)
<p>
A green Brewster tube <b>IS</b> a bitch!  The original REO (PMS) tube was a
5 mW size - about 15" long. They did a soft-seal on the B-window; because it's
fused silica. Don't know if they've gone to optical contacting/graded seal
now - I'd hope so.
<p>
I think REO added a 7 mW, maybe even a 10 mW size for power.  I recall
seeing some longer ones at a trade show.  As for cavity power, I've seen an
REO B-tube with 2 HRs do almost 45 Watts of intra-cavity circulating power.
They're probably higher than that now.  These puppies are like $1,700 each in
volume and only sold to PMS - pretty hard to come by.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
There is a weak line at 635.2 nm which could also show up as its gain is
higher than that of the 594.1 nm and 604.6 nm lines.  640.1 nm is actually
quite strong - next in line after 632.8 nm.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoo0">Instant HeNe Laser Theory</A> for a listing.
But it's probably killed by the mirror coating selectivity.
<p>
Here is a photo of the <A HREF="pms1b1.jpg">PMS One-Brewster HeNe Laser
Tube</A> and a closeup of the <A HREF="pmstune1.jpg">Littrow Prism Tuning
Assembly from PMS Tunable HeNe Laser</A> showing its proximity to the
one-Brewster tube's Brewster window.  There are adjustments for wavelength
and transverse (alignment).  The Littrow prism is the shiny thing at the far
left.  The Brewster window is next to it.  There is normally a tight fitting
metal cover to keep out dust which has been removed to take the photo.
Except for the high quality internal OC mirror and window, the HeNe tube
itself isn't that much different from the common variety, though the metal
envelope - typical of PMS/REO tubes - may help stability.  It does have a
heater coil on the OC mirror mount.  According to a PMS patent
(4,740,988: Laser Device Having Mirror Heating), this is to eliminate
color centers that may develop in the mirror coatings from exposure to UV in
the bore light.  (These heaters are on some but not all older PMS HeNe laser
tubes.)  The resistance is around 31 ohms and it runs on 9 VAC from a
small transformer.  I've never really seen any definitive improvement in
anything when running the heater.  New tubes don't need it.  The rest of
this laser is unremarkable - a brick power supply and case. :)

<h3><A NAME="hcltlcf">PMS/REO Tunable Laser Care and Feeding</A></h3>

Here are some notes on using the PMS/REO LSTP tunable lasers.  All models
from pre-1984 (PMS) to the present (REO) are physically similar and most
parts are interchangeable.  However, older lasers will include a small heater
coil that slips onto the OC mirror of the tube, powered by a transformer
glued to the bottom of the case.  The heater was supposed to eliminate
"color centers" in the mirror coating.  However, I've yet to be convinced
this made the slightest difference with any of the tunable or "other color"
HeNe lasers on which it was present.  It's not present on newer lasers.
<p>
CAUTION: The Brewster-end of the tube is all glass and fragile.  The high
voltage is also exposed in that area.  So, if you have removed the cover of
the laser, take care.  It would be a darn shame if a reflex response to
contact with the HV resulted in broken glass. :(
<p>
CAUTION: DO NOT attempt to remove or even loosen the screws at the bottom of
the rear plate.  The adjustable Littrow prism mount is directly attached to
the rear plate and this is joined to the Brewster stem of the tube via an
O-ring-sealed box with a removable cover.  Removing the rear plate without
observing exactly how this affects the relationship of the Littrow prism
mount to the tube's Brewster stem and taking appropriate precautions may
also break the tube.
<p>
CAUTION: DO NOT turn the micrometer adjustments further than necessary,
especially in the tighten direction.  I believe there should be enough
clearance between the Littrow prism and Brewster window such that contact is
not possible, but you really don't want to find out this isn't the case.  The
total useful range of the Color knob is less than 1 full turn and
perhaps 1/4 turn for the Transverse knob.  You won't find a blue line
by turning the Color knob past green! :)
<p>
If the laser needs to be opened, take out the screws ONLY at the top
at each end and lift the lid straight up.  DO NOT remove or even loosen
the screws at the bottom of the rear plate.  Note that since the
resonator is formed by all parts of the laser case, removing the lid
will likely change alignment enough to matter.  Thus, it is best done
with the laser lasing red so adjustments can be made.  Of course, if
the laser doesn't work, the alignment won't matter much.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The "Color" knob sets the wavelength.  The "Transverse" knob optimizes
 the side-to-side alignment.  When the laser is properly assembled, there
 should be little or no change in the Transverse setting as a function of
 wavelength and it should be possible to tune through all the
 colors including green (at least after a couple minute warmup) without
 adjusting the Transverse knob.  NEVER turn the Transverse knob beyond
 where lasing is lost and forget where you put it.  Just use it to peak
 the output once the wavelength has been selected.
<p>
<li>The optimal setting for each wavelength can be found by maximizing the
 power or adjusting for the best beam profile.  For the latter, expanding
 the beam will make this easier.
<p>
<li>Avoid turning either knob without power being on.  If lasing is lost
 entirely and you don't know which knob to turn, it may be necessary to go
 through the long alignment procedure.  (See below.)
<p>
<li>If the laser stops lasing on any color while your back is turned (this
 should not happen but....), first make sure the laser is still powered,
 then do a search in the vicinity, after having noted the exact original knob
 orientation.  What is meant by "search" is to very slowly rotate the Color
 knob in one direction over a range which includes the original setting,
 while moving the Transverse knobe back and forth.  Usually, this will get
 it back.
<p>
<li>If the search doesn't work, the long alignment procedure is needed:
 Position the sensor of an analog (preferably) laser power meter in front of
 the output aperture and turn out the room lights.  Set the meter on a range
 where the bore light reads around mid-scale.  Go back and forth adjusting
 each of the knobs to peak the reading.  At the point of lasing, the meter
 needle will fly off or wrap itself around the right end-stop. :)  This
 shouldn't take more than a minute or so.
<p>
<li>If the tube lights up but none of this works, it's quite possible a blob
 of dust or Q-tip fuzz from a previous cleaning fell onto one or both of the
 Brewster surfaces from moving the laser around or just a random event.
 You'll have to clean them.  I've used isopropyl and Q-tips - way to
 many Q-tips, but acetone or methonal may work better.  Keep the liquid off
 the adhesive as I'm convinced that it out-gases after sealing the cover.  Do
 the cleaning powered, first with red, then with green.  Looking at the
 scatter while monitoring the output with a laser power meter is the only
 way to really know when you've got it.
<p>
 Of course, if the laser was obtained on eBay, then the non-lasing state
 is normal. :) :)
<p>
<li>If shipping the laser, set the tuning for red, which is the strongest line
 and least likely to lose alignment from vibration in transit.  It should
 then lase red out of the box assuming the shipper failed to smash it to
 smithereens.  Where the original box isn't available, use at least 6 inches
 of padding/foam/peanuts on all sides.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="hcltune1">Proposal for High Efficiency Tunable HeNe Laser</A></h3>

If this has been done (which is very likely), I'd like to see the reference
or patent.  If not, I'm claiming it as my invention. :)
<p>
One problem that limits power in the REO tunable HeNe laser are losses
through the Brewster window of the 1-B tube.  The Brewster angle is only
correct at a single wavelength so there will still be some Fresnel
(reflection) at all the others.  And, even super polished fused silica isn't
perfect so there will still be some scatter.  In addition, matching the
orientation of the prism and the Brewster window of the tube is also
critical to maximize power.  If these issues could be eliminated,
the available power at all wavelengths would increase, but this would be
especially dramatic for the very weak 543.5 nm (green) and 594.1 (yellow).
So, what I suggest is to place the tuning prism <i>inside</i> the tube
envelope mounted on a two-axis bearing.  Coupling through the glass can
be via a pair of magnets to adjust tuning (pitch) and transverse mirror
alignment (yaw).  This is quite simple mechanically.  Even simpler would be
to attach the tuning prism assembly (also inside the tube) via a flexible
metal bellows adjusted via an external mount similar to the one in
the present LSTP tuanble laser.  In either design, 2 of 3
Brewster surfaces are eliminated from the intracavity beam path.  The
3rd one is for the Littrow prism which unfortunately cannot be eliminated
unless a high efficiency grating could substitute for the prism.  Dust
collecting on the optics is also, of course, no longer a problem. :)
And, a glass-to-metal or frit seal could be used in place of the soft
seal or optically contacted seal presently used to minimize stresses
in the Brewster window.

<h2>Siemens/LASOS HeNe Lasers</h2>

Here are the HeNe lasers currently available from
<A HREF="http://www.lasos.com/">LASOS Laser-Fertigung GmbH</A>.
Many of these were originally manufactured by Siemens, since acquired by
LASOS.  The "LGK" prefix denotes a complete laser head or "laser module"
as LASOS calls them.  The "LGR" prefix denotes a bare tube.  A much more
limited selection of bare tubes is available now at least.
Red, green, yellow, and orange tubes all use the same prefix.
The chart below is a conbination of what's on the LASOS Web site, a 1990
Siemens catalog, and other Siemens/LASOS lasers that I've come across.
It's possible that both heads and tubes are/were available for some of
the model numbers even if they aren't listed.

<h3><A NAME="hcls7638">Siemens LGK-7638 HeNe Laser Head</A></h3>

These lasers must have been used in a high speed printer or scanner.  Surplus
units show up on eBay and elsewhere quite frequently but I have never seen
any specifications.  The laser head itself is about 3 inches in diameter
and 21 inches in length but the tube inside is the typical diameter of
medium power HeNe lasers.  I've finally had a chance to evaluate a pair
of LGR-7638s, the laser tube inside the LGK-7638 laser head.
<p>
The LGR-7638 laser tube is generally unremarkable except for the reasonably
precise three-screw mirror adjuster at the cathode end.  There is enough range
that as long as you don't lose the beam entirely, it should be low risk to
tweak mirror alignment on this laser.  In all other
respects, the tube looks like a stretch version of shorter Siemens/LASOS
bare tubes with two spider bore supports and one square getter.
<p>
The following are based on physical measurements of an intact LGK-7638 laser
head and my tests of a two samples of somewhat less than pristine samples of
the LGR-7638 tube alone.  Only one of these came close to new specs with a
maximum output power of about 13 mW.  Thus the electrical measurements are
not likely to be exact, as operating voltage and optimal current may change
with use.
<p>
The measurements and healthier of the tube samples were provided by Alan
Scrimgeour in response to a posting on alt.lasers.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rated output power:</b> Probably around 12 mW based on tube length
 and comparison with other Siemens HeNe lasers.  Output power when new could
 exceed 20 mW.
<li><b>Beam output:</b> Anode end.
<li><b>Beam diameter:</b> 0.95 mm.
<li><b>Beam divergence:</b> less than 0.9 mR.
<li><b>Transverse mode:</b> TEM00.
<li><b>Polarization:</b> Random.
<li><b>Longitudinal mode spacing:</b> 311 MHz.
<li><b>Mirror spacing:</b> 483 mm (19.00 inches).
<li><b>Mirror alignment:</b> Three-screw adjuster on cathode-end mirror mount.
<li><b>Tube diameter:</b> 37 mm (1.46 inches).
<li><b>Tube length:</b> 489 mm (19.25 inches).
<li><b>Tube operating voltage:</b> Approximately 2,580 V.
<li><b>Operating current:</b> 7 mA +/-0.2 mA.
<li><b>Head ballast resistance:</b> 59K for anode, 22K for cathode. 
<li><b>Head operating voltage (at 7 mA):</b> 3,150 V.
<li><b>Head diameter:</b> 69 mm (2.72 inches).
<li><b>Head length:</b> 530 mm (20.9 inches).
<li><b>Head wiring:</b> Positive HV (red), negative HV (also red), Earth ground
 (green/yellow).  Cathode and ground are electrically connected inside the

This is among the largest HeNe lasers in current production.  Its overall
specifications are similar to that of the SP-107/127/907 though the details
of its construction differ.  Information can be found at the
<A HREF="http://www.lasos.com/">LASOS</A> Web site under "Products",
"HeNe", then click on "Modules".  There are a number
of versions of this laser with
different output powers but they are all mechanically similar (probably a
production sort in at least some cases).  Photos of a packaged
LGK-7676 can be found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser
Equipment Gallery</A> under "Siemens High Power Helium-Neon Laser".
<p>
The LGK-7676 resonator consists of 4 full length 5/8 inch diameter rods joined
by 10 thick plates.  The tube is secured to these plates using sets of 4 screws
with padded tips going in from all four sides at most locations.  Some sets are
adjustable for bore centering and optimizing straightness.  The end-plates
hold the mirror mounts.  Coarse mirror adjustment is via some thinner rods
attached to the ends of the main support rods, with pairs of nuts but no
springs.  This should permit the mirror mounts to be removed and replaced for
cleaning of the optics without requiring coarse realignment.  Fine mirror
alignment uses Allen's head screws to press on rods which slightly warp the
aluminum to which the actual mirror cell is attached.  It works reasonably
well with good sensitivity and repeatability except that the two adjustments
at each end aren't quite independent.  Note that with this scheme, walking of
the mirrors requires turning the screws at the two ends in opposite
directions.  The fine adjustments are similar to those in the SP-907 but
the coarse adjustments for that laser are three spring loaded nuts which means
that removing the mirror mounts requires complete realignment (unless
you are *really* good at counting turns!).
<p>
The entire resonator assembly is mounted on a thick piece of machined
L-shaped aluminum fastened with screws at only two locations.  However,
under about half the thick plates (see above) on both sides of the "L" are
adjustment screws to provide some sort of additional support.
<p>
The LGK-7676 uses a coaxial tube with about half of its bore exposed (as
opposed to the side-arm tube with totally exposed bore used in Spectra-Physics
lasers).  While this does result in a more compact package (overall dimensions
under 3"x3"x39"), there is less space for IR suppression magnets.  In fact,
the LGK-7676 only has two sets of magnets (in proximity to less than 25
percent of the bore) for this purpose but could definitely use more.
Adding moderate strength magnets (greater than refrigerator strength but
much less than rare-earth disk drive strength) almost anywhere along the
bore - even outside the large gas reservoir - resulted in a noticeable
increase in output power - about 1 percent for a single magnet.  I would
guess that with enough magnets, a 10 to 20 percent boost would be possible.
<p>
There are both anode and cathode ballast resistors of 81K and 27K,
respectively.  The power supply connector has 3 pins - anode, cathode, and
Earth ground.  But note that this pinout is not the same as on the physically
similar connector on Spectra-Physics lasers.  Thus, a Spectra-Physics
power supply cannot be used on a Siemens/LASOS laser or vice-versa
without modification or bad things will happen to the laser head and/or
power supply.  Check the power supply and laser head wiring to be sure they
are compatible if not originally mated!
<p>
The sample I tested is an LGK-7676S with a spec'd output power of at least
30 mW.  Of course, since I like to spend as little as possible to
acquire these things, mine is a high mileage tube which apparently served
hard duty in some sort of high speed printer since there was toner all over
it.  These are turning up on eBay (and possibly from surplus outfits
directly), probably being replaced when their output power drops below a
certain value by tiny diode lasers. :)
<p>
I was able to run it on my SP-255 exciter only by reducing the anode
ballast resistor to 60K and removing the cathode ballast resistor entirely.
Prior to this surgery, even with the input voltage to the SP-255 at 140 VAC
(the upper limit of my Variac), it would only run for a minute or two (and only
if it felt like it) and then cut out, not to restart for several minutes.  With
the modifications, it will now run all day at 120 VAC input, though restarting
was sometimes still a bit of a problem until I added circuitry in an
external pod to the SP-255 to boost its starting voltage.  (Note that this
may not be needed for LGK-7676, SP-907/107/127, and similar size lasers
with lower mileage tubes.)  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp31">Enhancements to SP-255</A>.)  The
SP-207 should be able to drive this laser without problems but I don't happen
to have one of those.
<p>
After bore straightening and mirror adjustments, I was able to squeeze more
than 19 mW out of the laser at a somewhat reduced operating current (10 mA
instead of the spec'd 11.5 +/- 0.5 mA).  (I'm using the lower current only
so I can look forward to increased power by a simple tweak in the future.)
It would exceed 20 mW if when fully warmed up, the laser was shut off
for 30 seconds and then restarted.  But the output power would drop back
to its previous level over the course of a minute or so once the "good" gas
had time to migrate back out of the bore or something. :)

<h2>Some Spectra-Physics HeNe Lasers</h2>

Spectra-Physics has manufactured some of the smallest and largest commercial
HeNe lasers.  There is a model 007 HeNe laser tube used in hand-held HeNe
laser-based barcode scanners.  This tube is only 4.75" (118 mm) long with a
diameter of about 7/8" (22 mm).  (There are at least three versions of the
007 tube: the 007-1, 007-2, and 007-3, which appear to be functionally very
similar if not identical.  The Melles Griot 05-LHR-007 is also nearly
identical.)  It requires about 2.75 mA at 900 V and puts out 0.5 to 1+ mW.
The largest Spectra-Physics HeNe laser, and possibly the largest commercial
HeNe laser of all time, was the nearly 2 meter long SP-125, described in
more detail below.
<p>
Regrettably, Spectra-Physics no longer manufactures any HeNe laser tubes.  They
appear to sell selected complete HeNe laser systems from
<A HREF="http://www.reoinc.com/">Research Electro-Optics, Inc. (REO)</A>
and the SP-117A stabilized HeNe laser - but even that uses a Melles Griot
tube!
<p>
Here is a chart of some older Spectra-Physics HeNe lasers.  Most of these
are from a 1988 catalog (along with 1988 prices).  Not all information was
available, thus the "???" in places.  You can go to the
<A HREF="http://www.spectra-physics.com/">Spectra-Physics</A> (now Newport)
Web site for current models (which are now quite limited, possibly to
the SP-117A frequency/intensity stabilized laser only).  But the hobbyist
and experimenter is much more likely to acquire the classic ones below
(unless very well endowed!).  Typical output power when new may have been
50 percent or more greater than the value listed.
<p>

Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The SP-107 (and the apparently similar SP-907) are versions of the
 tube assembly used in the SP-127 intended for OEM applications and
 configured in an open resonator (without covers).  (There does appear
 to be a sort of enclosure with electrical heaters for the SP-907 that
 but it was probably from some specific application.)
 As far as I know, these are the only large-frame SP lasers that have
 been recently in production but have not been manufactured since about
 2005.  The tubes used in these lasers are the SP-082
 with various -dash numbers indicating the output power sort.
 The original SP-207 exciter was similar to the SP-255 but its linear
 regulator appears to have a larger compliance range (with more pass
 transistors as well).  The newer SP-207A/A-1/B power supplies are switchmode
 based potted bricks.
<p>
<li>Several other exciters may be used with the SP-120 including the SP-247
 and SP-249.
<p>
<li>In addition to the SP-124B, there were also SP-124 and SP-124A lasers.
 The SP-124 may have used the SP-253A exciter rather than the SP-255. 
 However, the SP-122, a much smaller laser but similar in construction to the
 SP-124, appears to have used the SP-253A as well.  The SP-253A exciter uses a
 switchmode power supply which sends 225, 300, or 375 VAC (pin selectable or
 by internal taps depending on specific model) to a potted voltage
 multiplier/start module in the laser head.
<p>
<li>There is also an SP-250 exciter for the SP-125 laser which is the RF
 power supply option.  It appears to include an SP-200 RF exciter, possibly
 a pair of them, and other stuff in a larger box.
<p>
<li>The SP-135 is physically identical to the SP-133 except for a slightly
 longer laser head.  The SP-132M and SP-133M are multimode and slightly
 higher power than the SP-132 and SP-133.  The SP-132P is
 polarized using a ferrite magnet assembly that screws in place with
 its poles close to the bore.  However, the SP-133P is polarized using a
 coaxial (rather than side-arm) tube with an internal Brewster plate.
 The SP-133P polarization ratio is much better than that of the SP-132P:
 500:1 compared to 30:1.
 The SP-232s and SP-233s are basically the same laser but the SP-232s are
 self contained and the SP-233s are separate power supply and laser head.
 Same for the SP-234 and SP-235.
 The power supplies for the SP-130/B/C, SP-132s, SP-133s, SP-134,
 and SP-135 are nearly identical except for slight changes in the transformer
 voltage and the number and value of ballast resistors.  However, the
 SP-130B PSU also has a primary side pot to adjust
 tube current.  The SP-133s and SP-135 have a potted HV section which is
 essentially non-repairable.  The SP-130s HV section may not be totally
 potted but still likely difficult to get into.
<p>
<li>Some versions of the SP-155 and SP-132 may be quite similar but most of
 the SP-132s have a spiffier enclosure which is styled more along the lines
 of the SP-120 and larger SP lasers.  That basic SP-132 was also slightly more
 powerful than the SP-155 being rated 1.0 mW <i>minimum</i> while the SP-155
 is rated 0.95 mW <i>maximum</i> (nominal power probably about 0.5 mW).  The
 spiffier SP-132 is rated 2 mW.  The SP-156 looks
 very similar to the SP-155 but may be slightly higher power - perhaps the
 low cost version of the spiffier SP-132.
 (I'm now curious as to where the info about some versions of the SP-155 and
 SP-132 being in similar enclosures.  Nothing I've seen recently shows anything
 like this.) 
<p>
<li>The SP-117 is a frequency stabilized HeNe laser.  The SP-117A adds
 an amplitude stabilized mode but is otherwise similar,
 consisting of a cylindrical head and mating power supply/controller.
 The SP-117C is functionally similar to the SP-117A but consists of a
 bare tube mounted on a platform with the controller electronics and
 HeNe laser power supply, intended for OEM applications, and requires
 a separate user-provided DC power supply.  All of these lasers have a nominal
 optical frequency of 473.61254 THz.  I don't know how the SP-117A and SP-118A
 differ.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp117a">SP-117 and SP-117A
 Stabilized Single Frequency HeNe Lasers</A>.
 On some versions, the controller may be labeled the same as the system - i.e.,
 117A rather than 217A.  The SP-119 is a really old stabilized HeNe laser
 which may be locked to the peak of the neon gain curve using the Lamb dip
 (rather than the slope as is used with most other stabilized HeNe lasers
 including the SP-117/A).  I have no idea why it has a higher model number
 since it appears in a 1964 brochure, well before the SP-117.  The minimum
 output power of all the 117s is for each of the two orthogonal polarized
 modes.  The minimum output power of the 119 is total as there is only a
 single mode.
<p>
<li>The SP-136/P, SP-137/P, and SP-138/P all have a variable attenuator that
 allows for the output power to be varied from less than 1 mW to greater than
 2 mW.  The only difference between the model numbers is the type of head
 cylinder: SP-136/P is aluminum with precision mounting surfaces,
 SP-137/P is phenolic (plastic), and SP-138/P is aluminum.
<p>

<h3><A NAME="hclsp12x">SP-120, 124, and 125 HeNe Laser Specifications</A></h3>

Here are the nearly complete specifications for several high quality
scientific/research type HeNe lasers which have resonators with external
mirrors.  The SP-125, in particular, is definitely a BIG laser - size-wise at
laest - with a resonator length of over 1-3/4 METERS!  These are the type of
laser that might turn up in the long forgotten and dusty storage room of a
university physics/optics or industrial research lab.  Both of the larger
models permit the mirror assemblies to be replaced (or at least as an option
at the time of purchase) to select the output 'color' - normal HeNe red (632.8
nm), near IR (1152.3 nm), and medium IR (3391.3 nm).  (It's possible that
magnets may also need to be added/removed depending on the desired wavelength
though this is not mentioned in the spec sheets.  For an explanation, see the
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henmag">Magnets in High Power or Precision HeNe
Laser Heads</A>.)
<p>
It should be possible to possible to obtain orange (611.9 nm), yellow
(593.9 nm), and green (543.5 nm) output with similar modifications (at least
for the longer lasers), though the gain of these lines is only a fraction
of that for the red or IR lines (1152.3 nm and 3391.3 nm) so output power
will be lower.

Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The specifications for the SP-120 were copied from an original user manual.
 However, it did not list the tube operating voltage or current, so these
 values were sort of, well, guessed. :)  Several other exciters may be used
 with the SP-120 including the SP-247 and SP-249.
<p>
<li>Some versions of the SP-124 (possibly those without the 'A' or 'B'
 suffix) may use an SP-253A exciter instead of the SP-255.  These models
 require a mating boost/start module in laser head.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp4">Spectra-Physics Model 253A Exciter
 (SP-253A)</A>.  The SP-122 laser, a short version of the SP-124 (actually
 shorter than the SP-120 but construction is like the SP-124), may have also
 used the SP-253A exciter.
<p>
 The 1974 brochure for the SP-124A lists 611.8 nm (orange) as an optional
 wavelength, power not specificed.  The 594.1 nm (yellow, 11 mW) and 543.5 nm
 (green, 5 mW) wavelengths were also mentioned in a paper but although mirror
 sets for yellow at least were available, it's not known if they were from SP
 or an official SP product.  The green may have required changes to gas
 pressure/fill ratio and operating current as well.
</ol>
<p>
Actual power from these lasers may be much more than their ratings would
indicate, especially when new: greater than 35 mW for the SP-124B and up to
200 mW (!!) for the SP-125A with optimal mirrors, 150 mW with a tuning
prism.  (However, I don't know how likely such 'hot' samples, especially
of the SP-125A, really were.)
<p>
There is also a model 127 (OEM versions: SP-107 and SP-907) with the following
partial specifications (632.8 nm).  Beam diameter: 1.25 mm, divergence 0.66
mrad, length 38.75", height and width: about 4", power requirements: 5 kV,
11.5 mA, starting voltage: 12 kV + 6 kV pulse.  This appears to be the only
large-frame Spectra-Physics HeNe laser in current production.  See the next
section.
<p>
Mirror sets for green (543.5 nm), yellow (594.1 nm), and orange (611.9 nm)
were available for the longer lasers.  (The SP-120 and SP-122 may be too
short for the low gain green line.)  There were also tunable versions of
the SP-125 and possibly others.  The SP-116 was a tunable version of the
RF excited SP-115.  These used a Littrow prism in place of the HR mirror.
<p>
See the following sections for more information on these Spectra-Physics
lasers.

<h3><A NAME="hclsp107">SP-107B HeNe Laser Specifications</A></h3>

The SP-107 (and the apparently similar SP-907) is the same tube and resonator
as is inside the SP-127 and is intended for OEM applications.  As far as I
know, the SP-107/127 is the only large-frame SP laser still in current
production.  Newer versions have a hard-seal tube with optically contacted
Brewster windows and thus should not have the problems of the older SP lasers
that go bad from non-use.  Thus, if you're looking for a high power, high
quality, HeNe laser that can be transported by one person and won't decay on
the shelf, this is the one to get!  I've seen like-new samples of these go for
much less than $1,000 on eBay (about 1/5th the new price) and under $100 in at
least partially working (and possibly restorable) condition.
<p>
Even without powering up the laser there are two things that can be inspected
to get a rough idea of the tube's health (beyond the overall condition and
that it isn't in a million pieces):
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Getter:</b> Make sure it doesn't have the "white cloud of death"
 appearance.  The getter spot on these tubes is at the end of the cathode
 bulb where the negative lead attaches.  The getter electrode - one or more
 round or rectangular rings - should be visible opposite the getter spot.
 A good getter will have a dark or silver metallic appearance.  If it's
 milky white, brown, or red, then the tube is probably close to dead if not
 totally dead.  A clear getter may or may not be bad - it could either mean
 the getter was never fired, or that a material was used that is clear
 rather than metallic, or that becomes clear when it combines with those
 bad gas molecules.  Note that there should be NO metallic deposits
 anywhere else in the tube, particularly on the glass opposite the other
 end of the cathode can.  That would be an indication of sputtering and an
 end-of-life tube.
<p>
<li><b>Brown crud in bore:</b> Look for deposits of brown stuff inside the
 bore in the vicinity of the magnet poles.  High mileage tubes like this
 will always have some.  The brown stuff alone doesn't imply anything about
 the output power but is an indication that the laser has already seen a
 hard life and is less likely to be as lively as you'd like.
</ol>
<p>
The actual plasma tube in these is the SP-082 with various -dash numbers
after probably related to the actual output power.  I believe higher -dash
numbers mean a higher output power tube (at least when new).  These laser
heads may sometimes be listed based on the tube number but they are the
same thing since you really can't buy a tube by itself unless someone
was bored and decided to totally disassemble one!
<p>
The SP-107/907 resonator is over 38 inches long and of the "Stabilite" design
similar to that of the SP-122 and SP-124 but the mirror mounts differ.  There
is an internal L-shaped structure and outer thinner metal skin.  There
are two versions, differing the design of their mirror mounts:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Square main mirror mount plate (most common):</b> Three 1/4-28 threaded
 rods with nuts on spherical washers provide the coarse mirror adjustment.
 Fine adjustment is via a pair of recessed set-screws on the side or bottom
 (depending on how the laser frame is oriented) of each of the square plate.
 These move small rods which press on the smaller
 roughly triangular central portion of the mirror holder in such a
 way as to twist the mirror cell very slightly.  The two pairs of recessed
 set-screws provide relatively independent control of the two axes enabling
 easy mirror alignment and walking.  Under most conditions, the fine
 adjustments are all that should ever need to be touched unless the
 entire mirror mount is removed or someone decided that tightening the
 large nuts would improve the performance of  the laser! :)  The one
 exception is that should the best alignment end up with the fine adjustments
 too loose or too tight, then carefully correcting this incrementally
 by going back and forth between the coarse and fine for the same axis
 will be required.
<p>
<li><b>Triangular main mirror mount plate (less common):</b> Three 1/4-28
 threaded rods with nuts on spherical washers provide the only mirror
 adjustment. with no fine adjustments at all!  How one is expected to
 accurately peak a 3 foot+ large frame laser with 1/4-28 nuts on a small
 mirror mounting plate is not clear.  But presumably, once it's done the
 first time, shouldn't need to be repeated.  At least one can hope!
</ul>
<p>
In addition to mirror alignment, there are a pair of bore centering brackets
about 1/2 and 3/4 of the way relative to the cathode-end of the laser.
These have an effect on both output power and beam shape.  Carefully
tweaking for maximum output power should done in conjunction with mirror
alignment.
<p>
The bare resonators have no beam centering adjustments and I don't see any on
the packaged SP-127.
<p>
The tube has a side-mounted cathode chamber like other SP lasers but it is
quite oversize - about twice the typical diameter.  The ballast resistors
(2 at the anode-end, 1 at the cathode-end, all 27K ohms) are mounted
externally in glass tubes sealed with rubber and heat-shrink tubing.
The power supply connector has 3 pins - cathode, anode, and
Earth ground.  But note that this pinout is not the same as on the physically
similar connector on Siemens/LASOS lasers.  Thus, a Spectra-Physics
power supply cannot be used on a Siemens/LASOS laser or vice-versa
without modification or bad things will happen to the laser head and/or
power supply.  Check the power supply and laser head wiring to be sure they
are compatible if not originally mated!
<p>
IR suppression magnets are placed at every available location on two sides of
the bore.  Thin rubber boots seal the space between the Brewster windows
and mirrors but these can be pushed back to permit cleaning of the windows
and mirrors in-place (barely and not recommended unless the resonator has
been previously disassembled as the optics stay quite clean).  Some of these
lasers include a metal cover and electrical heaters to decrease the warmup
time required to achieve rated power and stability.
CAUTION: The part of the rubber boots surrounding the tube are easily torn
if the boots are removed since they tend to stick to the tube.
<p>
Depending on specific model, the SP-107/127/907 has a minimum output power of
25 or 35 mW but may do much more when new.  The following is from a
Spectra-Physics datasheet.  Only the specs for the red version are shown but
any of the other HeNe lasing wavelengths (except possibly 3.391 nm which may
require a wider bore tube and removal of the IR suppression magnets) should be
possible by substituting appropriate optics.  A yellow or green version
would be nice. :)

<p>
It is possible to run these lasers on the smaller linear SP-255 exciter but
starting may be erratic or not work at all (at least for non-pristine tubes)
unless the AC line voltage is
increased to 125 VAC for starting (it can then be backed off somewhat
while operating).  A bleeder resistor of 200M ohms or so rated for 15 kV
can be installed to discharge the power supply capacitors after shutdown
as starting of the longer SP-107/127/907 tube apparently requires the voltage
to rise from close to 0 V to start reliably on the SP-255's whimpy starter.
An alternative and better solution is to add a passive boost circuit to the
starting multiplier of the SP-255.  This can be in an external pod requiring
no modifications to the exciter itself.  Note that the added starting
voltage may not be needed for LGK-7676, SP-907/107/127, and similar size lasers
with lower mileage tubes.  If your laser starts reliably, don't worry
about it.  Otherwise, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp31">Enhancements to SP-255</A>.)  Make sure the
laser head frame is securely connected to the power supply (and earth)
ground.  Since the operating voltage and current are well within the
capabilities of the SP-255, the laser and power supply should both be
happy once started (though the AC line voltage may still need
to be slightly above 115 VAC to minimize drop out/restarts if there are
line dips, expecially for a high mileage tube which may have increased
operating voltage).  Changing the jumpers to use one of the lower line
voltage taps on the SP-255's power transformer would probably help in a
marginal case (low line voltage, or a laser with a higher HeNe tube voltage
or higher ballast resistance) where regulation can't be maintained with
adequate current without using a Variac to boost line voltage.

<h3><A NAME="hclsp115">Description of the SP-115 Laser Head</A></h3>

This is one of Spectra-Physics' first commercial HeNe lasers, probably from
the mid-60s.  It is RF (rather than DC) excited - basically a radio
transmitter attached to a neon sign. :)  Some photos of the laser and
exciter can be found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment
Gallery</A> (Version 1.88 or higher) under "Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon
Lasers".
<p>
The laser tube is about 20 inches long with separate bore and gas chambers
side-by-side.  The bore uses rather thin glass tubing and is a very large
diameter for a HeNe laser - about 3 to 4 mm ID - consistent with early
HeNe laser technology.  The laser head is nicely mounted with lots of fine
machined hardware.  It has no IR suppression magnets.  There are two RF
connectors on the side for the Spectra-Physics model 200 RF-type power supply.
One of the connectors is for the actual RF signal; the other is for starting.
There is an impedance matching network located under the "tube deck".  This
consists of a series LC circuit (C is adjustable for peaking the tuning)
between the RF input and case with the output taken from the junction of the L
and C.  The RF drives a dozen or so electrodes with alternating polarities in
close proximity to the tube bore.  The start connection goes to the input of a
potted transformer which produces a several kV pulse when the "Start button"
on the exciter is pressed.  The starting pulse goes to a separate small
electrode clamped near the center of the tube bore.
<p>
The laser has external adjustable mirrors mounted on the very solid precision
milled black anodized aluminum box support structure.  Both mirrors have screw
adjustments for coarse alignment not accessible from outside the case without
removing the end-plates.  The front mirror also has external fine adjustments
in X and Y via two precision Lufkin micrometers and the rear mirror is mounted
on a precision slide with an external micrometer adjustment for mirror
separation (try to find that on any modern laser!).  I don't know if the
intent of this axial adjustment (over 1/2" of travel) was to fine tune the
longitudinal or transverse modes or both.  Since the resonator frame would
experience little if any heating (and expansion), the micrometer could be used
to center a longitudinal mode and maximize output for this low gain laser.
In addition, the larger movement could possibly be used to select a particular
transverse mode pattern, though actually achieving TEM00 operation in
such a wide bore laser might not be possible.
<p>
The power supply for the SP-115 is a high quality 15 to 25 watt 40.68 MHz RF
source consisting of a crystal controlled oscillator and a power amplifier
using a 4x150 tube.  All active elements are tubes, of course, but out of
character for the era, the oscillator and driver are built on a printed
circuit board.  Overall, the system looks like something straight out of the
ARRL Handbook (which is probably where the design came from!).
<p>
Not surprisingly, on the sample I have, the tube has leaked and only produces
a weak purple glow when the RF is turned on.  The getter has the "white cloud
of death" syndrome and without an aluminum can cathode, there is no
possibility of getter action anywhere else.  (Not that a tube this far gone
would have any chance of revival in any case.  The tube would make an ideal
candidate for refilling since the vacuum could be breeched by cutting the
exhaust nipples at either end of the gas ballast without contaminating the
Brewster windows.)  The SP-200 does do a nice job of lighting 20 W fluorescent
lamps and most likely screwing up radio reception in the neighborhood. :)
<p>
There was also a Spectra-Physics model 116 laser which appears similar but has
a tuning prism to enable wavelength selection.  It goes without saying that a
working sample of an SP-116 would be a real prize. :)

<h3><A NAME="hclsp120">Description of the SP-120 Laser Head</A></h3>

The SP-120 is the same width and height as the SP-124, but just over half
its length.  Construction of the plasma tube is generally similar but it
is shorter and there are fewer IR suppression magnets.  However, the frame
and mirror mounts differ.  (The SP-122 is actually closer to a baby version
of the SP-124 with virtually identical construction to that laser but is
slightly shorter than the SP-120.)
<p>
Photos of a SP-120 laser head and the SP-120 resonator and tube can be found
in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (version
1.85 or higher) under "Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".  One thing the
photos don't show because it had probably been removed, is the "starter
helper" electrode, clamped to the bore near the side-arm.  This is connected
to the positive (anode) supply via a 100 pF HV capacitor.  So, the initial
rise in voltage produces a pulse on that electrode which helps to ionize the
gas.  Given the whimpy starter of the SP-256, it probably is worthwhile
insurance.  But I can understand why it was removed - getting the tube out for
replacement or Brewster window cleaning is very difficult with that assembly
in place.
<p>
The complete user manual for the SP-120 laser with SP-256 exciter can be found
at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/sp120opm.pdf">Spectra-Physics
Model 120 Laser with 256 Exciter Operation Manual</A>.
On the one sample of the SP-256 exciter that I've seen, the current was set for
7.2 mA.  However, I don't know if this is the default optimum setting for
the SP-120 laser or whether it had been tweaked.  (The specs list 7 mA
at 3.7 kV.  But less than 6 mA will work on a healthy tube.)
<p>
There is also an SP-120S.  The "S" stands for "Shutter" and
indeed, these have a plastic shutter lever to block the beam.  They also
have really cheapo plastic end-covers which block access to the screws and
thus make it impossible to do any adjustment without removing them entirely.
Perhaps that's a good thing. :)
<p>
There are also IR versions indicated by additional numbers after the model:
A 120-1 is 1,152 nm and a 120-2 is 1,523 nm, output power not known but
probably not much.  So, if you obtained an SP-120 on eBay that has a tube
with a nice shiny getter and good discharge color but no beam, check the
dash number!  Some versions might have a black VIS-blocking filter in
front of the output mirror, so that would be another clue.  It's hard
to pass red light through a black filter. :)
<p>
The resonator uses three-screw adjustable mirror mounts for coarse alignment
(tweaking these is a true pain!).  Fine alignment is done via a pair of
recessed hex screw adjustments at each end which actually shifts the tube
position at each end without affecting the mirror alignment.  Each screw
moves the end of the tube diagonally ( \ , / ) along a line intersecting
the center of the mirror.  So, use opposing pairs to walk the alignment.
The adjustment screws are accessible via a pair
of holes visible once the circular bezel/optics mount is unscrewed.  It is
possible to replace the tube in about 5 minutes without requiring major
mirror re-alignment (no need to touch the coarse adjustments, only the
tube centering).
<p>
The resonator is constructed from 3 pieces of thick very nicely machined
aluminum stock - an L-channel and 2 end-plates bolted together to form
a very rigid structure.  It is supported at only three points and essentially
floats inside the outer case (the "Stabilite" name as discussed for the
SP-124 laser, below) which isolates the resonator from external stress
(or so it is claimed).  So, the clunking you hear when changing the
position of the laser head is normal.
<p>
CAUTION: Unless the tube has been removed, there should be no need to clean
the optics.  Since there is no way to clean the Brewster windows with the
tube in place and no way to clean the mirrors without removing them, it is
a royal pain to be avoided.  Remove, clean, install, test and tweak, repeat
until output power comes back to what it was before attempting this stunt. :)

<h3><A NAME="hclsp122">Description of the SP-122 Laser Head</A></h3>

The SP-122 wasn't nearly as common as the SP-120 or SP-124 based on
the number of samples I've seen anywhere (exactly 1, which which I found on
eBay), but is interesting in
that the resonator is <i>identical</i> in every respect to an SP-124 except
it is about 1/2 as long.  The "Stabilite" frame, mirror mounts, and end-plate
adjustments are the same, but there are fewer magnets.  The tube is a bit
shorter than the SP-120 tube and may have a slightly narrower bore but is
otherwise identical.  This was no doubt a more expensive laser to manufacture
than the SP-120 so it probably never was very popular.  The only obvious
feature lacking in the simpler and probably slightly higher power SP-120 is
the adjustable beam position. And, how much would anyone pay for that?
<p>
The one I obtained also used the strange SP-253A exciter - a switchmode
power supply which sends medium voltage AC to a voltage multiplier/boost
module in the laser head.  See the end of the next section for more on this.
There is also an SP-123 which appears similar but with an internal power
supply.  (Not sure why the large difrerence in output power in the
table, above, though.  Another reference to these lasers also shows a
large difference of 3 and 7 mW for the SP-122 and SP-123, respectively.)

<h3><A NAME="hclsp124">Description of the SP-124 Laser Head</A></h3>

I obtained an SP-124 laser in 'as-is' condition for nothing, so I won't
complain.  The HeNe tube is gasy so it makes a nice wall hanging at this
point but has its uses in enhancing this section at least. :)  A photo of
a SP-124A laser head and SP-255 exciter can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
(Version 1.43 or higher) under "Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".
<p>
The SP-124 laser head is a box about 76 mm (H) x 76 mm (W) x 813 mm (L) (3" x
3" x 32"), nicely massive for its size.  There are threaded beam apertures at
both ends though the HR is backed by a solid aluminum plate so I don't think
much light would ever get through that even if there was leakage through the
mirror!
<p>
This is one of SP's "Stabilite" series lasers.  This approach to frequency
stabilization is based on a mounting system that employs optimally located
pivots in an attempt to minimize the coupling of gravitational and vibrational
torques and other distorting forces to the resonator cavity itself.  In the
SP-124, most of the mass of the laser head is in such an optimally mounted
heavy solid frame with roughly an L cross section that runs nearly the full
distance between the mirror mounts and attached to each of them at three
points.
<p>
Adjustments accessible externally at each end of the laser allow the beam
alignment (X and Y) to be tweaked very accurately by moving the entire optics
chassis relative to the head mounting studs (which accept 6-32 screws or rubber
feet).  The adjustment scheme is sort of interesting (to me, at least): A
V-shaped block (bolted to the rosonator and case) sits between a pair of wedges
(part of the mounting stud assembly) that can be moved up and down via a pair
of screws (call them A and B) and retained in position by a stiff spring.
Rotating both A and B equally in the same direction moves the beam in Y;
rotating A and B equally in opposite directions moves it in X.  The setting may
then be locked.
<p>
The external mirror HeNe tube is clamped in rubber mounts at its ends and
also stabilized at the 1/3 and 2/3 (approximately) positions.  Metal bellows
join the tube mount brackets to the mirror mounts and, in conjunction with
the rubber seals, prevent dust and dirt from getting on the inside surfaces
of the mirrors and on the Brewster windows.  The mirror mounts have hex head
bolts for adjustments with set screws to prevent their settings from changing
over time.  An additional metal bellows joins the OC to the treaded output
aperture.
<p>
The HeNe tube itself is a bare capillary about 7 mm OD with a 1.1 mm ID (no,
I didn't measure it - just trust the specs!).  The cathode, getter assembly,
and HeNe gas reservoir is in a side-arm at the output-end of the laser bent to
run parallel to the bore.  It is about 32 mm x 178 mm (1-1/4" x 7") with the
'can' electrode nearly filling the glass envelope.  The anode is (naturally)
at the other end of the bore along with the three 9.8K ohm (5 W at least)
ballast resistors also in a parallel side-arm inside the gas envelope as
apparently is the case with other Spectra-Physics lasers of this era.
Interesting, they are just ordinary Ohmite power resistors.  I guess this
approach does reduce problems with high voltage insulation breakdown but it
would be a shame if the laser went bad because a $.50 resistor failed and
could not be easily replaced!  The total value of about 30K ohms would seem to
be rather low but might have been selected to match the needs of the SP-253A
exciter (see below) or additional external ballast resistors may be required.
The SP-124B version of this laser may use a more normal 81K ballast resistance.
<p>
A series of relatively weak (e.g., refrigerator note holder strength) ceramic
magnets 14 mm (W) x 22 mm (L) x 6 mm (H) (9/16" x 7/8" x 5/16") are mounted in
close proximity under (15 magnets) and on one side (24 magnets) all along the
length of the bore wherever they fit.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henmag">Magnets in High Power or Precision HeNe Laser
Heads</A> for an explanation of their purpose.)  The approximate arrangement is
shown below.  I may have the poles backwards (which is of course irrelevant). A
cheap pocket compass came in handy to determine the pole configuration!:  The
magnets were positioned with their broad faces about 2 mm from the bore.

</PRE>
I assume that the only reason there aren't 24 magnets below the tube is that
the holes in the Stabilite frame got in the way.
<p>
Apparently, there must have been a couple of power supply options for the
SP-124.  Most of these lasers appear to use the
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp3">Spectra-Physics Model 255 Exciter (SP-255)</A>.
This is a traditional HeNe power supply providing operating and start voltage
through a high voltage BNC connector.  However, the laser I have apparently is
supposed to use an SP-253A Exciter, a model for which no one (including
Spectra-Physics) seems to have any information or even acknowledge exists
though I have since found out that the SP-122 laser, a model slightly shorter
than the SP-120 but built more along the lines of an SP-124, may have also
used the SP-253A (possibly a slightly different version or at least
different jumper options).  For more information on what I have found
out so far about the exciter, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp4">Spectra-Physics Model 253A Exciter (SP-253A)</A>.
<p>
Unfortunately, on the system I obtained, the boost/start module (which is what
I assume was supposed to be inside the head to attach to the exciter) had been
ripped out with the cable just chopped off and thus I can't even determine what
was there originally.  So, I removed the multiconductor cable and replaced it
with a HV coax (terminated with a standard Alden connector) and wired it
directly to the tube anode terminal and chassis ground (recall that the ballast
resistors are inside the tube.  Yes, I know, the 30K ballast resistance may
be too low for use with the SP-255!)
<p>
Using my SP-255 to power the head, I get a nice pink glow in the bore (more
red than orange indicating a rise in pressure from slow leakage over the
years) but as expected, no coherent light.  The low ballast resistance is fine
as far as maintaining a stable discharge (I don't know if this would still be
the case if the gas pressure in the tube were correct).  Maybe someday in the
far distant future after that hot place freezes over AND those pigs start
flying, I will get around to regassing the tube! :)

<h3><A NAME="hclsp125">Description of the SP-125 Laser Head</A></h3>

This is definitely a LARGE-frame HeNe laser by weight alone: roughly 45 kg
(100 pounds) for the head alone!  And, it is around 2 meters (over 6 feet)
long! Like its smaller cousin, the SP-124, there are models for normal red
(632.8 nm) and two IR lines (1152.3 nm and 3391.3 nm).  NEC made one almost
as large (GLG5800, over 5-1/2 feet long) and Jodon has high power HeNe lasers
but the SP-125 is still the largest production HeNe laser I've found.
<p>
The SP-125A tube has a common cathode in the middle of the tube with two
anodes, one at each end.  The dual discharges are driven from its SP-261A
Exciter which provides 6 kV at up to 35 mA.  The SP-250 Exciter is also
compatible with this laser.
<p>
With a bit of rewiring of the laser head, one could feed the anodes separately
reducing the individual current requirements so that a pair of power supplies
similar to the SP-255 could be used.  With this sort of scheme, it should also
be possible to selectively power only one of the discharge paths for reduced
beam output if desired.  Yes, I know, why would you ever want *less* power? :)
<p>
Two sets of ballast resistors in the laser head totaling 87K ohms (75K+12K)
provide the operating voltage to each of the anodes of the dual discharge
tube.  They are located between the anodes and chassis ground (The SP-261A's
output is negative with respect to ground.  Thus, ground is the positive supply
voltage).  The HeNe tube's single cathode is attached directly to the negative
output of the SP-261A.
<p>
The starter operates in a manner similar to that of the method of triggering
the xenon flashlamp in a typical electronic flash unit or solid state laser
power supply - by pulsing an external electrode in close proximity to the
HeNe tube bore.  The whole tube is supported by metal rods which are insulated
from the cavity structure by nylon disks.  One of the rods is the trigger
electrode.  The starter runs off a voltage from the 75K/12K ohm taps of both
ballast resistors ORed together so that it repeatedly generates a trigger
pulse until BOTH discharges have been successfully initiated.
<p>
The SP-261A also has a low power RF output (this isn't the same as the RF power
supply option mentioned below) which drives a pair of plates in proximity to
the HeNe tube.  The RF is supposed to stabilize the laser power (presumably by
some sort of discharge dithering process).  However, the RF apparently also
results in interference with local radio stations. :(
<p>
An RF power supply option is/was also available.  (Possibly some version of
the SP-200 though the specs don't quite match for the one I have.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp9">Spectra-Physics Model 200 Exciter
(SP-200)</A>.)  This would replace theSP-261A and starter entirely by driving
the tube directly with radio frequency energy - 15 W at 46 MHz.  Note the
greatly reduced power to the tube compared to the 150 to 210 W for the DC
discharge!  The drive is applied via coax from a BNC connector on the back of
the laser to a resonant circuit about midway in the laser head.  The two
phases of the output of the resonant circuit connect to a pair of 0.1 inch
diameter bars running the length of the tube about 0.6 inches from the
centerline suspended from insulators.
<p>
Unfortunately, many SP-125s that appear as surplus are not good for more than
long boat anchors (or as a parts unit for salvage of the optics and frame).
Unless the tube has been replaced relatively recently, being soft-seal, it
has likely leaked to the point at which the getter can no longer clean up
the contamination.  Refilling is the only option and that cost would make what
you paid for the laser look like pocket change.  And, refilling a HeNe tube is
generally not a realistic basement activity.  So, if you come across an SP-125
at a low price, unless it is guaranteed to lase, buyer beware.  An SP-125
sold "as-is" almost certainly means the seller couldn't get it to work (not
that everything possible wasn't tried) since they likely know it is worth 10
times as much in operating condition!
<p>

HeNe Laser Specifications</A> and

(From: Marco Lauschmann (mla@sbk-ks.de).)
<p>
The SP125A is absolutely beautiful with much chrome and a metallic blue cover!
It is nearly 2 meters long and looks like an older large-frame argon ion laser.
A Spectra-Physica scientist noticed that this device will deliver twice the
rated power with no problems.  Others have claimed as much as 200 mW for the
red (632.8 nm) model!

<h3><A NAME="hclsp127">Description of the SP-127 Laser</A></h3>

The SP-127 used to be the flagship large-frame external mirror
laser of the Spectra-Physics HeNe laser
product line.  With a spec'd output power of 25 or 35 mW (new ones did much
more), their patented "Stabilite" resonator construction, and a hard-seal
plasma tube, it was the laser of choice for holography and similar
demanding applications.  They used to be sold direct from SP as well as
through Edmund Industrial Optics, and elsewhere.  Many photos of the
SP-127 can be found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment
Gallery</A> under "Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".
<p>
The tube assembly used in the SP-127 is the same as the SP-107B described
above, with the side-arm plasma tube itself typically labelled "082-2
(25 mW), 082-3 (35 mW), or 082- (either).
It has optically contacted Brewster windows rather than Epoxy seals,
so it should have essentially unlimited shelf life.  A brick power supply
provides the required 11 to 12 mA at 5 kV, switchable between 115/230 VAC.
The case is similar to those used for SP's ion lasers except that the SP-127
has slots on top to view the cheery glow of the bore discharge. :)  Mirrors
are relatively easily removable and replaceable without requiring major
realignment, and swappable to change wavelengths.  I'm not sure of all the
wavelengths besides red (632.8 nm) that were supported by Spectra-Physics, but
orange (604.6 nm and 611.9 nm), yellow (594.1 nm), and the near-IR lines
(1,152 nm and 1,523 nm) would likely be possible without also replacing
the tube.  However, green (543.5 nm) might require a different gas-fill
and the mid-IR line (3,391 nm) might require a larger bore to get any sort
of reasonable power.
<p>
Unfortunately, SP has stopped manufacturing the SP-127 and sold off their
parts inventory to <A HREF="http://www.cambridgelasers.com/">Cambridge
Lasers Laboratories, Inc.</A>, who will still rebuild these (and other
SP HeNe lasers) - for a price. :)
<p>
The only readily available HeNe lasers with similar output power now are the
internal mirror Melles Griot 05-LHR/P-927/928.  The newer versions of these
are traditional HeNe cylindrical laser heads mounted in a rectangular case,
presumably for added thermal stability - or so they look simlar to the SP-127!

<h3><A NAME="hclsp130">Description of the SP-130 Laser</A></h3>

This is probably one of the earliest self contained portable HeNe lasers ever
sold.  (The original "Model 130 Gas Laser Operation and Maintenance Manual"
I have has diagrams date 1965 and 1966).  It even has a genuine leather
carrying handle. :)  And U.S. Patent #D202710: Gas Laser (drawings only),
covers the design of the case (including the leather carrying handle!).  The
overall construction is superb using precision
machined anodized aluminum for the main structure as well as the covers -
built along the lines of a Sherman Tank.  The laser is cute - about 13.5"(L)
x 4"(W) x 5"(H) and <i>heavy</i> for its size - about 11 pounds.  The SP-130B
uses a HeNe tube with Brewster windows and external mirrors all in a self
contained box.  Some photos can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under
"Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".
</ul>
<p>
The tube inside the lasers in the photos is the typical small Spectra-Physics
side-arm type (like those in the SP-155 and other similar lasers also
shown on the Web page above) but with Brewster windows instead of
mirrors.  However, earlier versions may look a bit different with a
side-arm for the anode as well and really early versions (SP-130, no B)
actually used a heated filament for the cathode (though for some reason,
the schematic of the SP130 with the heated filament is dated slightly
<i>later</i> than the schematic of the SP130B with the cold cathode design).
<p>
Based on the length of the tube, I would have expected its output power to
be in the 2 to 5 mW range.  However, from the specifications in the manual,
it turns out to be only 0.75 mW when used with the hemispherical mirror
configuration (planar and 30 cm radius of curvature), but capable of a TEM00
beam despite its wide bore (2.5 mm).  With a confocal configuration using a
pair of 30 cm mirrors, the beam is multimode (non-TEM00) and output power may
be as much as 1.5 mW.
<p>
When I obtained the first of these lasers (the one in the top two photos),
the tube actually still lit up but there was no output beam.  At first I
thought it might even have a chance of working since the discharge color
looked sort of reasonable, though somewhat less intense than I would have
expected.  Fiddling with the optics didn't yield any positive results.  And
then, when I wasn't looking, the discharge went out! As best I can tell, a
crack must have opened somewhere in the tube and it is now at much higher
pressure or up to air - bummer!  I can find no visible damage or any evidence
of this except that it won't start even on a much larger HeNe power supply and
shows no signs of a glow from an RF source.  So far, the getter hasn't changed
color.
<p>
I don't think this laser was ever really alive - the tube was probably gasy
or helium deficient or something but I still can't explain what happened.  The
only place it could have leaked that I can't see is under the anode connection
which is kind of potted but there shouldn't have been any heat there to cause
such a problem.
<p>
And to compound my disappointment, I dinged the OC removing the tube.  Enough
of it may be left to still work but the optics appear to be soft-coated as the
AR coating came off totally by just barely touching it.   However, that still
hurts.  Sometimes, you just have one of those days. :(
<p>
The laser in the third photo was DOA with an up-to-air tube, seriously
damaged mirrors (coatings mostly gone), and evidence of prior dissection
attempts (cut wires, etc.).  The tube in that one is probably one of the
earliest non-heated filament types with a small cathode and separate side-arm
for the anode.
<p>
However, I have since obtained a third SP-130B which originally had a red/blue
discharge.  But while running for a few hours, the color gradually changed
to a mostly correct white-ish red-orange.  And, with an optics cleaning and
alignment, this SP-130B actually lases.  The output power is not up to spec -
about 0.25 mW at maximum current (it's rated at 0.75 mW) - but that's still a
bit amazing considering its age.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrr130">Reviving a Spectra-Physics Model 130B Antique
Laser</A> for details.  I've had it for over 5 years now (since 2000)
and it's output hasn't changed noticeably.  I run it for a few seconds almost
daily just to let it know that it's loved and that seems to keep it happy.
<p>
The internal power supply accounts for much of the weight and most of the
height of the box and consists of:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A potted high voltage transformer with a single pair of thick output leads.
<p>
<li>A potted block that contains the doubler, filter, and ballast resistance.
<p>
<li>A power rheostat (that knob visible in the first photo) in series with
 the primary of the HV transformer to adjust tube current.
<p>
<li>A low voltage (2.5 VAC, 6 A) transformer for powering the filament of older
 hot cathode HeNe tubes.
</ul>
<p>
There is no actual starter - the open circuit voltage of the power supply is
about 5,000 VDC but drops to around 1,500 VDC under load.
<p>
For more info and schematics, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscspa">Spectra-Physics Model 130 HeNe Laser Power
Supply (SP-130)</A>.
<p>
Now, the question becomes: Do I leave the dead ones intact as examples of
antique lasers or replace their tube and optics with modern 3 mW barcode
scanner tubes (about the largest that would fit height-wise, a 1 inch
diameter tube) to have working lasers?  I guess there's nothing special about
3 mW HeNe lasers so leaving them intact would be the best option.  And, it
would be a shame to only have 3 mW when the power supply is easily capable
of driving at least a 5 mW tube.  In order to do a test with an SP098-2
barcode scanner tube (actual output: 2.8 mW), I had to add 500K ohms of
ballast resistance in addition to what is built into the power supply to
get the current low enough so the adjustment would include the optimum
current setting.  (I can hear the antique connoisseurs
breathing a collective sigh of relief!)  Who knows, maybe someone will
drop replacement tubes and mirrors in my lap someday!  Hint, hint. :)
<p>
There is also an SP-130C laser which is virtually identical in construction
and function, except for the lack of an external current adjust pot.

<h3><A NAME="hclsp155">Description of the SP-155 Laser</A></h3>

The Spectra-Physics model 155 is a basic, bare bones, low power, low cost self
contained HeNe laser probably used in countless classrooms to introduce
uncountable bored students to geometric optics. :)  Its rated power is
0.5 mW (Class II, 0.95 mW max) but when new probably approaches the safety
limit (there is an adjustable glass plate neutral density filter inside to
attenuate the beam if necessary) - a "hot" SP-155 tube might produce 1.25 mW
or more.
<p>
Photos of a typical SP-155 can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under
"Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".
<p>
The HeNe laser tube is the classic Spectra-Physics side-arm design but
with the anode electrode mounted about halfway along the length of the
bore.  The same tube with the anode mounted at the end would produce around
4 to 5 mW.  In fact, the Spectra-Physics 157 (3 mW) and 159 (4 mW) lasers are
virtually identical except for the tube's anode location and the use of a
larger power supply.  (The SP-156 may be similar but I haven't seen one
to confirm.)
<p>
The power supply for the SP-155 is a basic transformer/doubler/multiplier
design with a single transistor current regulator.  The power supply
on later versions of the SP-157 and SP-159 lasers may be a potted brick
instead of a discrete PCB but all of the SP-155 lasers appear to retain
the older quaint power supply design. :)
<p>
Note that other manufacturers sell (or have sold) lasers identical in
appearance to the SP-155.  For example, there is a Uniphase model 115ASL-1
and a Liconix L-388 (even though it is made by Uniphase).  However, these
use a hard-seal Uniphase barcode scanner HeNe tube (similar to a model
098 with a tiny collimating lens attached to its OC to reduce divergence)
rather than the fancy Spectra-Physics side-arm tube we know and love.  But
their power supplies are similar or identical to that used in the SP-155.
(There is also a Spectra-Physics model 155ASL which is physically identical
to the Uniphase and Liconix lasers except for the name on the front.  I assume
it has the same construction though I haven't seen the insides of one up close
and personal.)

<h2>Spectral HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.spectral.it/">Spectral</A> is an Italian company which
manufactures high power HeNe lasers, CO2 lasers, and power supplies, among
others.  Their HeNe lasers have rated output powers of up to 60 mW, but
are all multi-spatial mode.

<h3><A NAME="hclsptcl1">Spectral RMM355 High Power Multimode HeNe Laser</A></h2>

This is a medium length rectangular laser head with separate power
supply box.  The laser head and power supply each weigh about 4-1/2 pounds,
so, the entire rig is very portable.
<A HREF="http://www.spectral.it/">Spectral</A> is an Italian company which
manufactured only the laser head and it does appear professionally built.
But the power supply box that came with it is more along the lines of
someone's science fair project.  It's constructed safely, but shall we
say, rough around the edges.  In fact, while correcting some of its
cosmetic flaws, I found that the front plate had been flipped around
with the original markings covered, something to do with a battery charger. :)
So, the power supply is not from Spectral.
<p>
The RMM355 is multi-transverse mode laser, which in itself is a novelty.
This sample has an output power of about 40 mW 8.3 mA.  (Yes, that's 40 mW.)
The beam is generally circular with what is basically a top-hat profile
(more or less flat with ripples), has a divergence of about 2.7 mR,
and is random polarized.  The model number does include "R" and "MM". :)
The RMM355 (which is an earlier model, not listed on the Spectral Web site)
is rated at 35 mW minimum output power and typically does
40 to 44 mW after warmup.  The current version is the <i>RMM355L</i>
which is rated at 42 mW minimum at 10 mA, and typically does 48 mW
after warmup.  Spectral actually has an even larger model which has a
minimum output power of 60 mW!!.  Wow, darn, I want one! :)
<p>
The laser head is a rectangular aluminum extrusion, capped at both
ends with what look like black Plexiglas plates apparently attached with
adhesive which has so far resisted my best efforts to remove them.
The head is about 2-3/16x2-3/16x34-3/4 inches but the actual tube length
is not known.  There are no screws or mounting holes anywhere.  However,
based on the spec'd longitudinal mode spacing of 175 MHz, the tube in the
RMM355L has a mirror spacing of about 33 inches - nearly the length of the
laser head.  I measured the operating voltage on the RMM355 and it is about
3,380 VDC, within the tolerance limits of the spec'd value for the RMM355L
of 3,300 V, so the tube length is probably the same.  The HeNe laser tube
has internal mirrors and is probably of relatively conventional design,
but with a wide bore.  There is a simple hole in the output cap for the
beam to pass (no shutter) and a hole in the rear plate for the Alden
cable.  I'm sure I could get more power by aligning the mirrors but
it doesn't look like there is any easy non-destructive way of getting
inside at either end.  They seem to be glued all too well. What's the
fun without tweakability! :)
<p>
Thankfully, regardless of the looks of the power supply box,
the actual power supply is a Laser Drive brick, 2900 V at 7.8 to 8.3 mA,
adjustable.  It was set all the way up on my sample.  40 mW at 8.3 mA isn't
too shabby but I tested the laser head using an SP-255 on a Variac and the
it produces about 43 mW at 10 mA and 44 mW at 10.5 mA.  I have since
acquired a power supply that is adjustable via an external pot and goes
up to 12 mA (which is apparently acceptable for this laser, at least for
a short while).  With that, I can get 48 mW at 12 mA. :)

<h2>Uniphase HeNe Lasers</h2>

Datasheets for current models may be found by going to the
<A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase Web Site</A>, then
to "Commercial Lasers", "Products", and "HeNe Gas Lasers".  The
listings below include some older models as well.
<p>
Except as noted, these are all cylindrical laser heads with lab-style power
supplies.  Note that the divergence values for multimode (non-TEM00) lasers,
and even whether some are TEM00 or multimode, may not be correct due to errors
in both the on-line and printed datasheets I've seen.
<p>
I have two sets of specifications here. The first were mostly from the JDSU
Web site as of 2006 but a few may be from other sources:

The "M" versions for the above lasers are apparently multimode but with
incomplete specifications.  (The "M" here is apparently not the same as
for the ones listed below.)

The next set is what are currently found in the .pdf on the JDSU Web site
in 2010.  Most of the specifications are the same except for operating
voltage (maybe JDSU calibrated their HV probes!) but a few models are no
longer present:
