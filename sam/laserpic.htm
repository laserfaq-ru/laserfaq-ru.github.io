<h2>Introduction</h2>

The <b>Laser Equipment Gallery (LEG)</b> is a collection of pages associated
with <A HREF="../lasersam.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ</A> which provides thumbnails
and links to full size photos of a variety of specific pieces of laser
equipment including interior and exterior views and closeups.  Additional
wings will be added as I receive new photos so check back here frequently.
<p>
Due to its size, the Laser Equipment Gallery is NOT part of the
Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ or Sam's Laser FAQ distributions and is not
resident at all of these sites.  See: <A HREF="../samsites.htm">Home and Mirror
Site Locations</A> for other sites with these collections of documents. 
<p>
If you are viewing this page, it probably means you have attempted to access
the Laser Equipment Gallery from a site on which it isn't resident.  Please
select from the links below which take you directly to the collection of
photos at the selected site.  The first three are likely to have the most
recent version as I update them personally.
