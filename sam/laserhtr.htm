<h2>HeNe Problems and Testing</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My Tube is Good?</A></h3>

A variety of faults can result in a HeNe tube not working properly.  These can
be the result of a large number of problems including a bad tube, a bad power
supply, incorrect input voltage (or configuration), incompatibility between
the tube and power supply, bad or incorrect ballast resistor, or defective
wiring.
<p>
If all you have is a HeNe tube but no power supply, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrthlt">Testing a HeNe Laser Tube Without a Compatible
Power Supply</A> for ways to determine if the tube is good.  The following
applies to both bare HeNe tubes and laser heads though some of the inspection
and/or tests will require removing the tube from any enclosure.
<p>
<ul>
<li>If your HeNe tube doesn't start at all (no flashes or anything) or flashes
 periodically (with a momentary laser beam produced at its output), see the
 section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt1">Starting Problems and Hard-to-Start
 Tubes</A>.
<p>
<li>If your HeNe tube starts and lases but is somewhat unstable, see the
 section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt3">Unstable or Flickering HeNe Tube</A>.
<p>
<li>If your HeNe tube starts and the discharge appears normal and stable (see
 below if you don't know what this means), but there is no laser beam or it is
 very weak, see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt2">Possible Causes of
 No Output with a Normal Discharge Glow</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Several types of problems can prevent a HeNe tube from lasing properly or make
it hard to start:
<ul>
<li>Physical damage.  Obviously if the tube arrived in pieces, this is a
 shipping, not a technical problem. :-)
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Chips or scratches (small or large) on the edges of the mirrors are of no
  consequence as long as they don't interfere with the exit location of the
  beam.  For the output mirror, this is roughly the central millimeter or
  just slightly more depending on the power of your HeNe tube.  For the high
  reflector (the other mirror), it doesn't matter at all since the only
  important surface is the inner one.
<p>
  However, such damage could be an indication of a trauma that misaligned
  the mirrors - though this is quite unlikely - see the next paragraph.
<p>
 <li>Fractured capillary.  Normally, the discharge is forced to take place
  within the capillary-bore.  However, if the HeNe tube or head has been
  dropped or subjected to other forms of physical torture, the thick glass
  capillary may break off, usually near its attachment at the anode-end.  The
  discharge then takes the easy route bypassing the broken-off section of
  capillary and you have a nice piece of high-tech art for your family room
  wall. :(  See: <A HREF="henefc.jpg">HeNe Laser Tube With Fractured
  Capillary</A> for glorious photos of one unfortunate HeNe tube. :)
<p>
  Thus, if your HeNe tube appears to be glowing like a neon sign or fluorescent
  lamp (outside the bore) and starts at a very low voltage - perhaps half of
  the normal *operating* voltage specified for the tube - this may be the
  cause.  A way of detecting it without powering the tube if the problem isn't
  obvious by inspection (it is hidden inside a laser head) or from the way the
  tube rattles, sight down the bore of the <b>unpowered</b> tube.  In all
  likelihood, the capillary will now be misaligned enough such that one or both
  ends will be way off-center or not even visible.  And, if it is still held in
  place by any metal spacer(s) that may be present, there will be no clear
  path through from one end to the other.  Unfortunately, there is no way of
  repairing such damage.  Where only a small part of the bore has broken
  off, the tube may still lase weakly if the broken part isn't blocking the
  internal beam path (or it can be jiggled such that this is the case).
  However, power will be way down.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Misaligned mirrors.  Using the tube as a hammer might bend the mirror mount
 at one end or the other.  If one or both of the mirrors are misaligned by
 more than an infinitesimal fraction of a degree, the tube will not lase at
 all.  Even if the mirrors appear to be perfectly aligned, they could still
 be far enough off to prevent the tube from working.  A slight misalignment
 might only result in a decreased power or low quality output beam and this
 can probably be corrected.  However, note that the mirror mounts could
 *appear* to be misaligned but this is actually compensating for mirrors that
 were not attached squarely to the mounts - don't be tempted to correct this
 until you are sure it is actually a problem!  Although mirrors mounts on the
 tubes of some manufacturers are more easily knocked out of alignment than
 others (Aerotech tubes seem to use very soft metal), casually touching them
 won't do it - significant effort would be required to permanently change
 alignment without the use of some sort of tool beyond the human hand.
 However, gentle sideways pressure (use something that is well insulated!)
 will be enough to change alignment enough to affect output power unless
 a locking collar is installed (but it will spring back after release).
<p>
 Note: if you have a high power (long) tube, mirror alignment may not be
 correct until the tube warms up and/or external permanent adjusters may be
 required to stabilize the mirrors.  Without these, there may be no, low, or
 fluctuating power.  Very slightly pressing on the mirror mounts - or even
 on various parts of the tube itself - (with a well insulated tool!) will
 result in a significant variation in power.  There may also be a "This Side
 Up" label on the tube or head indicating the proper orientation for optimal
 performance.  Parts in the tube droop due to gravity (not the electrons,
 ions, or photons!).  This probably applies mostly to HeNe tubes that are
 greater than 15 to 20 mW, are "other-color" (e.g., green) tubes, and possibly
 only some types and condition.  However, there could be some less dramatic
 effects with shorter tubes.  In addition, just touching one side of the tube
 with your hand will cool it which may result in a noticeable power change due
 to the slight contraction which results in a minute but significant bending
 of the tube and chance in mirror parallelism!
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking and Correcting
 Mirror Alignment of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> for more information.
<p>
<li>Internal punch-through.  Symptoms are similar to those of a fractured
 capillary, above.  A (possibly thin) glass barrier at the anode end
 of the tube prevents current from bypassing this path.  However, any breech
 in this barrier - even a virtually microscopic pinhole - will result in the
 discharge taking place outside the bore and at a much lower voltage as with
 a fractured capillary.  And, there is similarly no cure.  Once a pinhole
 develops, the path of least resistance is via this route.  The appearance of
 the discharge will be similar to that of a HeNe tube with a fractured
 capillary (above) except that the point where the glow originates may be an
 almost invisible hole.
<p>
 Aside from manufacturing defects, one way for such a failure to occur is for
 a power supply fault to drive grossly increased current through the HeNe
 tube.  It is possible for this to result in an abrupt termination of the
 discharge inside the bore and an inductive kick and huge voltage spike due
 to the wiring.  With the bore momentarily unavailable, the only other path
 is for an arc through the glass barrier.  Like the failure of a MOSFET gate
 oxide due to electrostatic discharge, once any breech develops, it does not
 heal!  The addition of a spark gap surge protector sized to break down at
 just over the specified starting voltage may represent a prudent precaution
 when driving large expensive higher power HeNe tubes.  Figure about 25 kV
 per inch - though this can vary considerably depending on the shape of the
 electrodes and environmental conditions.
<p>
 This is one reason not to use a power supply much larger than needed for
 your particular HeNe tube.  I found out the hard way when while violating
 my recommendation not to use a microwave oven transformer, this happened
 with a large (35 mW) HeNe tube due to a wrong connection which bypassed
 the ballast resistor.  It was not pretty :-(.  The HeNe tube is now good as
 a sort of high tech neon sculpture but not much else.  I even found a
 defective power supply brick - inadequate start voltage - that powers the
 sculpture just fine.  Now to put it all on a nice polished wood base. :)
<p>
<li>Gas fill problems.  The health of the gas inside the HeNe tube can be
 largely inferred from the color of the discharge.  The normal color inside
 the narrow bore is white-ish red-orange - a somewhat unsaturated version of
 the red-orange glow of a (true) neon sign.  Spectra-Physics (the laser
 company) calls this 'salmon color'.  Since I haven't seen any brightly
 glowing electric salmon lately, I'd rather stick to a physical description.
 The normal color may also vary slightly based any number of factors like the
 manufacturer's secret recipe as well as random chance! :)
<p>
 See <A HREF="henedcol.gif">Color of HeNe Laser Tube Discharge and Gas
 Fill</A> for some not too terrible renderings of a normal tube's bore and
 some typical problems.  (Of course, your computer monitor has to be
 reasonably well adjusted for these to be at all accurate.)  Discharge
 viewing must be through a glass part of the tube, not the mirrors since
 their transmission wavelengths will dominate.  For an enclosed laser head,
 it may be necessary to remove one of the plugs on the side or the anode end
 end-cap (taking care around the high voltage!).  The comments
 about output apply to red HeNe tubes; orange, yellow, green, and near-IR
 HeNe tubes will likely produce no output at all unless the gas fill is
 nearly perfect.  However, to maximize gain, "other color" HeNe laser tubes
 will likely have a slightly different discharge color due to modifications to
 the ratio of He:Ne, the isotopic purity of the gases, and other unknown
 factors.  So, before you blame bad gas, make sure your tube is indeed
 the normal red variety.  As examples of other color tubes:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Green (543.5 nm) HeNe lasers may have a discharge that is more pink
  but just as bright as the normal red discharge.
<p>
 <li>Near-IR (1,523.1 nm) HeNe lasers may have a discharge that is more orange
  and just as bright or brighter than the normal red discharge.
  </ul>
<p>
 Various shades of red, blue, and white are symptoms of gas fill problems.
 Since the total amount of helium and neon in a typical 1 mW HeNe tube is
 much less than a cubic cm - if returned to atmospheric pressure, almost any
 leakage or contamination is significant and will likely prevent lasing.
 Where the tube is 'up to air', no discharge will take place.  And, a state
 of affairs anywhere in between is possible and especially common for old
 soft-seal tubes.  Loss of helium through diffusion is can take place as
 well.  Each of these cases is discussed below.
<p>
 However, without a monochromator or optical spectrum analyzer, you won't
 be able to see slight changes in discharge color and these may be enough to
 kill lasing (though normally, they will be obvious).  The only way to really
 determine if the color is correct where it looks correct and you happen
 not to have fancy instrumentation is to do a side-by-side comparison with
 an identical working HeNe tube.  I say 'identical' because there can be
 subtle variations in the normal gas fill from different manufacturers
 (and from different color HeNe tubes).  It may also be possible to take
 photos (digital or otherwise) of the two tubes (if you don't have two
 power supplies to run them simultaneously) and then compare those, but
 getting good color rendition may be a challenge.
<p>
 Note also that the brightness of the discharge at the same current will
 almost always be lower with gas fill problems.  This may not be immediately
 obvious unless a good and bad tube are run side-by-side but then it can be
 quite striking.
<p>
 If the tube has a getter electrode (see the section:
 <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt1a">HeNe Laser Tubes and Laser Heads</A>), check
 the color of the getter spot on the glass in its vicinity.  The function of
 the getter spot is to combine with any unwanted non-noble gases (mostly
 oxygen and nitrogen) and should generally be black or metallic in appearance
 if still functional.  A milky white, red, or brown color generally indicates
 that significant air leakage has occurred and the tube is probably no longer
 functional.  Sure, it might be on the hairy edge but this isn't likely!
 (Note that sometimes a tube will be manufactured with a getter electrode but
 for whatever reason, it was never activated, the active material remained
 within its structure, or the active material is transparent.  Thus, there
 is no getter spot, good or bad, and therefore no way to know - from this at
 least - whether there has been leakage.  (For example, all normal (non-barcode
 scanner) Melles Griot HeNe laser tubes have a getter electrode but no getter
 spot regardless of gas-fill condition.  So there's really no way to know their
 state of health for the getter.)  It may be possible to reactivate
 the getter electrode by heating it by RF induction or some other means to
 drive off more getter material that may be present but (1) this is definitely
 for the advanced course and (2) the likelihood of helping the HeNe tube at
 this point is small unless the amount of leakage was very very infinitesimal.

<p>
 I have rejuvenated a couple soft-seal HeNe tubes by heating the getters,
 either with a glow discharge or a Solar furnace made with an overhead
 projector Fresnel lens.
<p>
 (From: Sam.)
<p>
 I have also revived both a red and a green Melles Griot HeNe laser tube
 using a jerry-rigged Solar furnace made from a $1, 7" x 10" plastic Fresnel
 lens intended as a reading magnifier.  See the sections:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhldc">HeNe Tube Lases but Color of Discharge
 Changes Along Length of Bore</A> and <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmggr1">Melles
 Griot GreNe with No Output</A> for details.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Loss of gas fill.  This may result in a total inability to start or
  sustain the discharge.  The most likely locations for a leak (assuming
  the glass isn't obviously smashed!) are where the mirrors are joined to
  the tube (metal or glass), other glass-to-metal seals, and the metal sealing
  nipple ("tip-off") if used.  Of course, your power supply could be bad or
  inadequate well.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm2">Testing
  a HeNe Power Supply</A>.
<p>
  Any source of RF power can be used to determine if a bare tube still has a
  reasonably low internal pressure (but not if it will lase).  However, RF
  excitation cannot be used to test enclosed laser heads because it is
  generally not possible to view the inside of the actual HeNe tube and the
  (metal) case would prevent RF penetration or create other problems.
<p>
  This approach can sometimes be an effective way for
  starting some HeNe tubes (even one that is normally hard-to-start) if the
  ionization reaches enough of the bore.  It should certainly be able to
  substitute for the normal high voltage starting circuits for exposed
  capillary type HeNe tubes like those in laboratory lasers like the
  Spectra-Physics 124 and its cousins.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Placing the HeNe tube in the output coil or near the antenna of a low
   power RF source like a radio transmitter or high voltage inverter should
   result in an orange glow inside of the tube.  Use only enough power or
   position the HeNe tube only as close as needed to confirm that there is a
   glow.  Too much power can result in excessive heating or arcing and melting
   of internal structures of the HeNe tube.
<p>
  <li>Applying the output of a <i>small</i> Tesla coil (not that 7 foot
   science fair project!) or similar device to a metal part of the tube
   is very convenient for this purpose and should result in an
   orange glow inside the tube.  A hand-held Oudin coil like a BD-10
   is very convenient for this test and is what I use routinely as a quick
   check of tubes that don't want to cooperate.  (For BD-10 info and a link
   to one manufacturer, see the section:
   <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrbd10">BD-10 Anatomy and Repair</A>.)
<p>
   Note: For metal enclosed laser heads, it will likely be necessary to
   remove one of the end-caps and the wire connection to the tube
   before being able to apply RF to it from a low current source like an
   Oudin coil even if the cable is known to be good.  Otherwise, the
   capacitance of the cable will greatly reduce what reaches the tube
   and there may be no glow even if it is perfectly healthy.
<p>
   CAUTION: Too much voltage will puncture the glass and ruin the tube.
   If using an HV or RF source that has an output terminal like an Oudin
   coil, it is best to attach a couple inches of wire to a metal part of the
   HeNe laser tube (like a mirror mount) and then touch that rather than
   the glass.  And, use the lowest setting.  If it doesn't glow with that,
   it's not going to do any better at 1,000,000 V. :)  DO NOT apply it to
   the glass unless you are sure the voltage is less than about 10 kV.
   The dielectric breakdown voltage for the glass of HeNe laser tubes
   may not be that high!  Use the metal parts and wire extension to be safe.
<p>
  <li>Connecting the output of a small high frequency high voltage source
   (like those based on TV or monitor flyback transformers) to the anode or
   cathode terminal of the HeNe tube will also work.  There is no need to
   even attach the other end of the tube to anything.  It won't lase but, as
   above, there should be an unmistakable orange glow in the vicinity of the
   excited terminal.  The same high voltage circuits as those mentioned
   above may be used for this test.  But see CAUTION, above.
   A couple of easy-to-build circuits can be found in the document:
   <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/samschem.htm">Various
   Schematics and Diagrams</A>.  One of these, specifically adapted for this
   important application is shown in <A HREF="flybkrf1.gif">Flyback Based RF
   Source</A>.  RF excitation may also be to test for gas fill problems in
   other ways.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrssh">Attempting to
   Revive Some Soft-Seal HeNe Tubes</A>.
<p>
  <li>A microwave oven can be used for this test as well.  (However, you didn't
   hear it from me!).  Place the HeNe tube along with a cup of water (to act
   as a load) inside the oven.  (Make sure no part of the tube is, or can come
   near, the walls oven walls.)  Set it to cook for 10 seconds on HIGH.  Now,
   with one finger on the STOP button, press START and watch the HeNe tube.
   As soon as the microwaves start being generated (usually about 2 to 3
   seconds for the magnetron filament to heat), the inside of the HeNe tube
   should glow bright orange-pink (this actually is quite spectacular).  Hit
   STOP as soon as the glow appears.  If there is no evidence of a glow
   inside the HeNe tube at any time (the glow may fluctuate if there is a
   microwave stirrer or turntable in the oven) or all you get is sparking or
   arcing, the tube is likely bad due to a broken seal or really old age
   (non-hard sealed HeNe tubes in particular).
<p>
   CAUTION: Damage may occur to the HeNe tube if the glow continues for more
   than a couple of seconds.  Don't ask me how I found out (portions of
   the glass became hot enough to crack).  Damage may also occur to you if
   your parents find out you were using the family microwave for this
   purpose. :-(
<p>
   If the color is more toward the pink, lavender, or white, the gas fill
   may be incorrect or some air may have leaked in.  Or, the tube may be
   end-of-life with significant sputtering around the cathode.  See the
   additional paragraphs on gas-fill problems, below.
<p>
   More extensive testing and even partial resuscitation of some HeNe tubes
   may also be possible while heating your hot chocolate.  See the section:
   <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmic">Using a Microwave Oven to Evaluate and
   Revive HeNe Laser Tubes</A> for the exciting, but risky, details. :)
<p>
   Note: In case your were wondering, this is not an effective way of
   exciting the tube to lase as the discharge intensity inside the narrow
   bore (capillary) where it counts is way too low.  See the section:
   <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpscao2">RF or Microwave Power Supply for HeNe
   Laser?</A>.  As a point of interest, the inventors of the HeNe laser, Ali
   Javan, William R. Bennett, Jr., and Donald Herriott, of Bell Labs,
   attempted to use a magnetron for excitation of their original laser in
   1960 - and the quartz tube melted!  This approach would probably have been
   quite effective for their wide-bore design if it were not for this minor
   amount of collateral damage.
<p>
   However, since you will no doubt insist on experimenting, (1) do so with
   something other than the family microwave and (2) consider using a Variac
   to drive the primary of ONLY the high voltage transformer of the microwave
   generator (fed from the microwave oven's controller).  For safety, DON'T
   attach it externally, DON'T bypass or disable any door interlocks, and
   make sure the cooling fan is always powered from the full line voltage.
   This modification will allow some control of power (relatively safely) so
   that your experiments will be at least less likely to destroy things too
   quickly.  (However, note that the filament of the magnetron is also powered
   from the HV transformer, so this will limit the useful range and result
   in some time delay for power to stabilize.)  My guess is that adjusting
   the knob somewhere between 60 and 80 percent, and full voltage will result
   in 0 to 100 percent of microwave power (the magnetron is a non-linear
   device which has a threshold voltage below which no output is generated).
   Then, after you have tried basic nuking of your sacrificial HeNe tube, see
   what effect a short length of wire attached to the anode (to act as an
   antenna) will have on excitation of the central bore, add shielding,
   adjust tube position, etc.  Have fun but take care!
  </ul>
<p>
 <li>Incorrect gas fill.  There may be a glow but the laser output will likely
  be weak or non-existent.  The tube may be hard to start.  The normal color
  of the discharge is white-ish red-orange - a somewhat unsaturated version of
  the red-orange glow of a (true) neon sign.
<p>
  Note that if you can sustain a discharge but it is the wrong color, you may
  have one of those really old Epoxy sealed tubes that leak and air has leaked
  in.  The tube is probably not worth repairing but might make an interesting
  wall hanging (power optional).
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Loss of helium (from diffusion through the glass or seals) will result in
   the glow becoming deeper red-orange and less white, and probably less
   intense.  There will be little or no emission at the wavelength of
   helium's spectral lines.  The starting and operating voltages of the
   tube will also be different than what is normal for a good tube of the
   same type.  It probably isn't worth the effort to refill but see the
   section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr1">Rejuvenating HeNe Tubes</A>.
<p>
   If you have a spectroscope (see the section:
   <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henvsl0">Instant Spectroscope for
   Viewing Lines in HeNe Discharge</A>), it is easy to see if this is the case
   as the neon lines in <A HREF="spechene.gif">Bright Line Spectra of Helium
   and Neon</A> will be predominant.
<p>
   One quick test that can be performed visually with a simple diffraction
   grating to compare the brightness of the neon 585.25 nm line and the helium
   587.56 nm line.  These are (or should be) two bright adjacent yellow lines.
   If the mix is correct, these two lines should appear equal in brightness.
   OK, maybe it isn't so simple since finding those lines by eye could be
   a rather large challenge. :)  However,
   they can be seen in <A HREF="spechene.gif">Bright Line Spectra of Helium
   and Neon</A> although the helium line is much brighter in this rendering.
<p>
  <li>A leak which has allowed some air to enter (but where it is not totally
   up to atmostpheric pressure) will result in a glow with a white or pink
   color.  Depending on the actual pressure, the intensity will vary as well
   and there may be striations or 'beads' in the discharge glow.  The color
   may vary along the length of the bore.  This will show oxygen, nitrogen,
   and other spectral lines possibly with little evidence of helium or neon.
   The getter (if present, see above) will also be exhausted.
<p>
   It doesn't take too many of those nasty H2, N2, or O2 molecules to affect
   lasing adversely since they have many energy level transitions much lower
   than the helium transition to get excited.  With just a small amount of
   unwanted gases, there may still be an output beam, though it will probably
   be much weaker than expected.  One unusual characteristic of such a tube
   may be that the discharge color is correct at the anode-end of the bore but
   wrong toward the cathode or may vary in some other way.  See the section:
   <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhldc">HeNe Tube Lases but Color of Discharge
   Changes Along Length of Bore</A>.
<p>
   With incorrect pressure and unwanted gases, the tube voltage could be
   quite different than normal (low or high).  The tube cited above had a
   slightly lower (perhaps 100 to 200 V) operating voltage before having its
   getter activated.  Where the discharge voltage has increased, the tube
   will dissipate more power while operating, and thus may also run hotter
   than normal HeNe tubes.   Small amounts of oxygen and nitrogen may
   increase the starting voltage substantially as well.  If you can measure
   tube voltage (see the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm1">Making
   Measurements on HeNe Laser Power Supplies</A>), compare it with your
   tube's specs (see the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht">Internal
   Mirror HeNe Tubes up to 35 mW - Red and Other Colors</A>).
<p>
  <li>Gas contamination due to end-of-life.  Once the "pickling" (oxide
   coating) on the aluminum cathode has been used up, the tube has perhaps
   100 to 200 hours of useful life remaining.  Without the coating, there
   will be excessive sputtering of aluminum and the discharge color will
   gradually change to a purplish-white hue, probably with an increase in
   operating and starting voltage, and decrease in output power until there
   is none.  Shiny metallic deposits on the glass at the cathode-end of the
   tube are another symptom.  (But don't mistake these for the getter present
   on some tubes.)  For Melles Griot tubes, there will be metallic spots
   opposite the 3 or 4 holes in the aluminum cathode can next to the cathode
   end-cap.  Give it a proper burial (but the mirrors may still be
   salvageable). :)
  </ul>
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Damaged electrodes or mirrors due to running with the power supply polarity
 reversed or greatly excessive current for a prolonged period of time.   Metal
 sputtering from the negative electrode coating the mirror at that end of the
 tube will quickly render the laser useless.  Buy another tube.
<p>
 And, I've seen exactly one (1) HeNe tube that had the mirror coating on one
 (1) of its mirrors totally blown away, most likely due to damage resulting
 from a lose cathode-mirror mount connection and the discharge taking place
 inside the mirror mount tube itself.
<p>
<li>Tubes with many hours on them may have some brownish or metallic deposits
 on the inside of the bore but this is often harmless.  However, such a film
 could also be an indication that serious sputtering has taken place coating
 the mirrors as well once the protective oxide on the aluminum cathode has
 been depleted from long hours of service.  Any significant metallic film on
 the glass <i>not</i> near the getter is probably an evidence of sputtering.
 For example, on many Melles Griot HeNe tubes, there are several small holes
 punched through the cathode can near the mirror mount.  If the glass outside
 these holes has a metallic film, it's probably bad news  Such tubes are also
 not salvageable.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmdim">Damage to Mirror Coatings
 of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> for more details.
<p>
<li>Wiring or electrical leakage problems may make it appear as though a tube
 is hard to start, won't start at all, or runs erratically.  This applies
 mostly to enclosed (e.g., cylindrical) laser heads where everything can't be
 inspected.  The ballast resistors or anode connection can break from thermal
 cycles or even careless manufacturing.  If moisture gets inside the head,
 there may be arcing or corona which prevents the buildup of the starting
 voltage.  If the leakage is really bad, a current meter in the cathode
 return may even show a fraction of a mA even though the tube doesn't start.
 That leakage current is more than enough to reduce the starting voltage
 significantly on switchmode power supply bricks and to near zero on linear
 power supplies with voltage multipliers!
<p>
 This seems to be particularly common with Melles Griot (and similar)
 tubes using a "start-tape" running from the anode almost to the cathode along
 the cylinder wall.  Any condensation will cause problems.  I recommend
 disconnecting the start tape from the anode and removing it entirely
 by carefully tearing it or pushing it way back inside so the end is at least
 an inch away from the anode connection.  I have never seen the start tape
 make <i>any</i> difference in starting time though Melles Griot claims some
 statistical benefit. :)
<p>
<li>A hard-to-start-tube may show no signs of life (but operate perfectly
 normally with rated or better output power if it can be started).  Some HeNe
 tubes do not follow the general rules either from age, abuse, or by design.
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt1">Starting Problems and
 Hard-to-Start Tubes</A> for additional information and testing procedures.
<p>
<li>A tube that starts but seems hard to keep running using the proper
 power supply may have an excessive operating voltage from long use.
 Just as with neon lamps and neon signs, the operating voltage of HeNe
 laser tubes that have been operated for many thousands of hours may have
 increased by 10 percent or more.  On average, the output power may also
 have declined, but not necessarily in a dramatic way until true end-of-life.
 Sometimes, changing the ballast resistance slightly, or using a power
 supply with a higher maximum output voltage may allow the tube to continue
 to work for a long time.
<p>
 Similarly, the dropout current may have increased to the point where
 the power supply current setting is marginal.  Increasing the operating
 current may allow the tube to continue to operate for awhile but it's
 probably nearing the end of its useful life.
<p>
 For more on measurable parameters of a HeNe laser tube that can be used
 to assess its health, see the sections starting with:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrsstl">HeNe Tube Use and Life Expectancy</A>.
</ul>
<p>
It probably doesn't make sense to spend a lot of effort, time, or money to
revive a 1 mW HeNe tube that can be replaced for $15.  However, if you are
ambitious or a new tube cannot be substituted easily (e.g., due to mounting
restrictions), see the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr">Repairing Leaky or Broken HeNe Tubes</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrhthlt">Testing a HeNe Laser Tube Without a Compatible Power
 Supply</A></h3>

First time laser enthusiasts are often confronted with this problem:
Becoming the proud owner of a HeNe laser tube but no HeNe laser power supply
and possibly no specs for the tube or assurance that it is even good.  What
to do?  How can a quick inexpensive test be done to determine if the tube
works?
<p>
First, you need to determine the tube's power connections.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htridc0">Identifying Connections to Unmarked HeNe Tube
or Laser Head</A> if you aren't sure.
<p>
There are many ways to power a HeNe tube for the purposes of seeing if it
produces a beam.  Almost anything that can provide enough voltage to get
a few mA through the tube will result in at least a momentary flash of
laser light out the end if the tube is good.  There won't be any way of
determining output power or whether the tube meets specs, but the knowledge
that it lases at all may be enough to take the next step - the purchase or
construction of a proper power supply.
<p>
It is easy to use the family microwave to see if the tube is gas-intact if
the tube will fit inside.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmic">Using a Microwave Oven to Evaluate and Revive
HeNe Laser Tubes</A>. While this won't tell you if the tube lases, if it fails
this test, there is no need to go further.
<p>
To test for lasing, current must be passed through the bore of the tube.
A couple of options for a quick test power supply are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Small neon sign, oil burner ignition, or other transformer with an
 open circuit output voltage of 3 to 8 kV (depending on the size of the
 HeNe tube), microwave high voltage rectifier, and appropriate ballast
 resistance to limit current to a maximum (peak) of 6 to 10 mA (3 or 4
 mA average for a half wave rectified system).  Higher voltage transformers
 may be usable, especially if you put the entire rig on a Variac.  The power
 source could also be a solid state neon sign power supply instead of an
 iron transformer.  See the next section.
<p>
<li>Any sort of high voltage low current DC power supply including: air cleaner
 or ozone generator, bug zapper, the output of the HV in your TV or computer
 monitor (well maybe not the one you normally use), etc.  Depending on the
 output voltage and available current, a ballast resistor may be needed.  Open
 circuit output voltage will need to be greater than the starting voltage
 requirement of the HeNe tube - 5 to 12 kV depending on size.
<p>
<li>I've even heard of someone who tested a large HeNe lsaer head using a
 shag carpet. :)  He grounded the negative pin of the Alden connector
 and then shuffled across a thick carpet and touched the positive pin.
 The static discharge made the laser head lase for an instant - a faint
 red dot on the wall.  But that's enough to determine that it's gas intact
 and that the mirrors are reasonably well aligned.  Of course, one must
 be wearing the proper kind of shoes with a suitable carpet and very
 low humidity to generate really painful inch-long sparks, or else it
 won't work. :)  This is about as Rube Goldberg as you can get for HeNE
 laser testing. (A tip contributed by Sean Martin.)
</ul>
<p>
Even a high voltage AC supply with appropriate current limiting can be used
safely <b>for a few seconds only</b>.  (I've been sent HeNe laser tubes
which have been operated on AC because the owner copied some power supply
design off the Web and didn't know any better.  The output power (what
of it there was) gradually declined over a few minutes and then there was
none.)  And even with the rectifier voltage, the tube will be restarting
once per cycle which is hard on it so don't run that for too long either.
None of these are suitable to operate a HeNe tube continuously unless
proper filtering and starting circuitry is added to turn it into a proper
HeNe laser power supply.
<p>
Don't go overboard though: Too high a voltage applied in the wrong place
can arc straight though the glass at which point you have a rather boring
high-tech sculpture. :(  A very high current can also damage the tube
very quickly, thus the need for the current limiting ballast resistance.
<p>
With these power supplies driving the tube, if there is <i>any</i> output beam,
even if it is weak or in the form of short flashes, the tube is probably good.
However, there is no way to tell if it meets specs since HeNe laser output
power is only maximum over a narrow range of tube current and these quick
test power supplies are at most controlling only average current, not
instantaneous current as would be the case with a real HeNe power supply.
But, at least you know the tube isn't dead.

<h4><A NAME="htrqdpsu">Quick and Dirty Universal HeNe Laser Test Power
 Supply</A></h4>

The following simple device can be used to confirm that a HeNe laser tube or
head is not totally dead.  It won't be able to help with output power or be
safe to run for more than a few seconds but should produce some coherent
output from any HeNe laser from 0.5 to 40 mW or more.
<p>
It consists of the following components in series:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Neon sign or oil burner ignition transformer 8 to 12 kV.  Almost any
 current rating more than a couple mA.
<p>
<li>High voltage rectifier rated 30 kV PRV or more.  This can be a pair of
 microwave oven HV diodes in series, a HV rectifier from a monitor or TV, or
 a stack of 30, 1N4007s in series.
<p>
<li>Ballast resistance rated 2M ohm, 20 watts, 15 kV.  A stack of 20, 50K,
 1 watt resistors in series would be suitable.  Note that the power rating
 is inadequate for continuous operation but should be fine for a test lasting
 only a few seconds.
</ul>
<p>
Wire the output of the transformer in series with the rectifier(s) and ballast
resistors.  The positive output goes to the anode of the HeNe head or tube;
the negative to the cathode.  It doesn't matter whether the laser has an
internal ballast resistor.  Insulate everything VERY well. :)
<p>
Powering the laser should result in flashes of coherent light, probably at
the power line frequency (60 or 50 Hz).  The amount of light will not be
that impressive even with a perfectly good high power laser since the current
is nowhere near optimal for any length of time, if ever.  However, the
presence of laser output would confirm that there is life.
<p>
WARNING: Since centertap of transformer secondary should be grounded, both
outputs of the power supply will be floating with respect to ground.  Take
care.

<h3><A NAME="htrhldc">HeNe Tube Lases but Color of Discharge Changes Along
 Length of Bore</A></h3>

I've only seen this on a couple of HeNe tubes but the appearance is quite
strange.  At the anode-end of one, which I call the "Northern Lights" tube,
the discharge color is perfectly normal - white-ish red-orange (salmon color),
just as would be expected in any self respecting HeNe tube.  However moving
toward the cathode-end of the tube, the color changes to what appears to be a
much more blue-ish white color (relative to the normal white-ish red-orange,
though in absolute terms it may be more of a pink), typical of some sort of
contamination.  However, having a tube with the behavior provided a way
(as you shall see below) of relating power output to the color of its
discharge.
<p>
In this condition, the tube still lased at a power level which relative to its
rated output, is approximately proportional to how much of the bore has the
correct color.  In this sample, about 2 mW for a tube specified at 4 to 5 mW.
I don't believe the starting or operating voltage has been affected very much.
<p>
The explanation that makes the most sense is that due to the discharge current
in the bore, the few N2 and O2 atoms (and any other party poopers that may
have entered without an invitation) are being ionized and pushed toward the
cathode of the tube leaving the desired helium and neon atoms to play at the
anode-end.  The contamination, whether due to a manufacturing problem or an
air leak, is so marginal that nearly all of the unwanted atoms are swept from
about half the length of the bore.  However, the other HeNe tube I have like
this had the color change in the exact opposite direct - correct at the cathode
but blue-ish-pink at the anode, also reduced power.  I now suspect that it
may have been internal contamination.  More research is needed. :)
<p>
Another unusual characteristic of the Northern Lights tube was that the output
power (what of it there is) peaked at a current somewhat higher than expected
(8 mA as opposed to the 6 or 6.5 mA typical of this size tube).  I don't know
whether this is simply due to the overall contamination or that more of the
nasty unwanted ions being swept from the bore when running at a higher current.
<p>
This tube had an unfired getter which provided a means of cleaning up the
contamination without a refill.  A few weeks later, I got around to making
the attempt.  And the results are....  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrnlt">Repairing the Northern Lights Tube</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrhtt1">Starting Problems and Hard-to-Start Tubes</A></h3>

Some tubes seem to practically start on their own.  Other won't perform even
when you stand on your head, hold your breath, and provide the proper chants
and sacrifices. :-)  Note that this may not be a problem under your control.
Apparently, even the Ph.D. physics types at major laser companies may not
understand why apparently identical HeNe tubes from the same production run
may vary in their ability to start by a large amount.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhsht">About Hard Start HeNe Tubes</A>.
<p>
However, it could also be that your power supply operating voltage, ballast
resistor, and other factors may need modification.  Of course, if the system
used to work reliably and suddenly died, an actual power supply or wiring
problem is most likely though a dead HeNe tube is also possible especially if
the system has been unused for several years.  But don't overlook the
unlikely, but not impossible situation where your line voltage is low
for some reason!  Check it first.  The discussion below is
somewhat oriented to the situation where a HeNe tube or laser head is being
assembled with a power supply (or parts have been replaced) and the
combination just doesn't want to work properly.  However, some of it also
applies to actual failures as well.  Where the power supply itself is suspect,
see the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm">Power Supply Measurements,
Testing, Repair</A>.
<p>
There are several types of possible behavior depending on how well the power
supply, ballast resistance, and HeNe tube are matched up, and if any of these
as well as the wiring, are faulty.  You first need to determine if the
discharge is being initiated at all.  If the starting voltage is adequate,
there will be momentary flashes that may be extremely short and weak and only
visible in a darkened room but operating current may not actually follow.
Under marginal conditions, operating current will flow in response to the
starting voltage but won't be maintained.  These flashes will be brighter and
longer in duration.  The result may be a nice flashing laser.  In fact, this
progression is exactly what will be seen when operating a HeNe laser tube from
a power supply on a Variac as the voltage is increased: Short flashes followed
by longer flashes and at some point, a steady beam.
<p>
WARNING: If your HeNe tube doesn't start after a reasonable length of time
(like a minute), don't leave the power supply on overnight in a futile attempt
to get it going.  Starting is a stressful time for power supply components,
especially some wide compliance designs, and an extended period with the
very high starting voltage on parts of the circuitry may result in total
failure.  It could also result in electrical breakdown (arcing) inside the
laser head or cable.  If the laser is flashing, this may be ultimately bad
for the tube as well.  Turn it off, step back, and try to determine what
is wrong.
<p>
Where the power supply components and/or wiring is exposed and subject to
dirt and grime, first, carefully clean everything to eliminate possible
sources of electrical leakage, which can affect operation, particularly
the very low current starting circuit.  As an experiment, try warming up
the unit (which drives off conductive moisture) with a hair dryer or heat
gun on the 'low heat' setting.  This may enable it to start more easily
confirming the need for some housekeeping. :)
<p>
First, vacuum and/or dust it off with a soft brush, then use mild detergent
and water followed by isopropyl alcohol (rubbing or medicinal is fine as
long as there are no additives).  Give it ample time to dry completely.
The hair dryer or heat gun can be used to help it along.  You may now find
that your starting problems have disappeared!
<p>
If your tube or head has an external starting loop or tape (see the
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt3">Power Requirements for HeNe
Lasers</A>), it must be cleaned thoroughly as well (or maybe it has become
disconnected, is broken, or has shorted to the case!).
<p>
There is also a possibility that something else is shorting out the power
supply, possibly only when enough voltage is applied so it won't show up
with an ohmmeter test.  Sometimes, the ballast resistor inside cylindrical
laser heads will arc to the case.  This can be checked with an HV insulation
tester or more easily for most people, by removing the end-cap(s) and
visually inspecting (as well as smelling!) for evidence of arcing, or
by disconnecting the anode wire and driving the tube directly from the
power supply with an external ballast resistor.
<p>
Assuming none of this helps, there are three types of behavior: (1) No action
of any kind, (2) an occasional flash possibly at random intervals, and (3) a
periodic flashing laser which never settles down to normal steady operation.
However, the behaviors and their causes are not really always independent so
read through all of the possibilities before replacing components or ripping
your system apart!
<p>
<ol>
<li>Tube does not fire at all.  This means that the tube itself appears totally
 dead with no flashes inside and no evidence of a beam, even for an instant.
<p>
 This generally means that the starting voltage is inadequate for the tube
 or isn't reaching it, there are other circuit problems, or the tube is bad.
 In rare cases, shining a light into the tube will allow it to start.
 Tubes with longer and narrower bores (capillaries) will generally require
 greater starting voltage and your power supply may just not be up to the
 task.  While tube manufacturers generally specify a starting voltage of 7
 to 10 kV (or higher), typical tubes will fire with 3 to 5 times their
 operating voltage.  Thus, a tube that runs on 1,700 VDC will probably start
 on 5,400 to 8,500 VDC.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>There may be too much leakage in the anode circuit preventing the buildup
  of adequate starting voltage.  The problem may be in the power supply
  itself or in the wiring to the HeNe tube.  Corona discharge or arcing can
  result from inadequate insulation or component spacing as well as sharp
  points in the wiring or connections.  Dirt and grime may also reduce the
  insulation resistance.  A sizzling and/or ticking sound along with the
  aroma of ozone are indications of this sort of HV breakdown.  Highly
  humid conditions may make the situation worse.  For pulse (trigger) type
  starters, there may be too much capacitance as well.
<p>
  In the case of an enclosed laser head with a HV (e.g, Alden) connector,
  HV cable, and internal (potted) ballast resistor, there may be a
  breakdown in one of these components and it may only show up when
  starting voltage is applied (not with an ohmmeter).
<p>
  Allow the laser to attempt to start for 15 or 20 seconds and turn off
  the power supply.  Immediately pull the Alden connector out of the power
  supply and discharge it on a metal surface.  A nice long (e.g.,
  1/4") spark indicates that the starting voltage is probably
  adequate from the power supply and breakdown in the wiring is
  not likely.  If there is little or no spark,
  either the starting voltage is low or zero, or there is a broken
  connection between the connector and the tube resulting in not much
  capacitance to store a charge.
<p>
  Here are two more tests for this situation:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Remove the negative connection from the ballast resistor assembly
   entirely - float it so the starting voltage cannot arc to anything.
   Connect the negative directly to the cathode of the HeNe tube or laser
   head case as appropriate.
<p>
  <li>Disconnect the anode of the HeNe tube and substitute your own ballast
   resistor and wiring.
  </ul>
<p>
  If the tube now starts, one of the original components was faulty (most
  likely the potted ballast resistor assembly if the negative connection
  runs through it) and this will need to be replaced.
<p>
 <li>There may be an open ballast resistor or break in the wiring inside an
  enclosed laser head.  Check with an ohmmeter (with power off and
  the tube capacitance  discharged!) all the way from the power supply or
  Alden connector to the tube terminals or mirror mounts (as appropriate).
  Don't forget to check the negative (return) connection and cathode ballast
  resistor (if present).  Some laser heads have the wires simply
  clipped on or use little push-on connectors to attach to the tube
  mirror mounts, exhaust tip-off, or through-glass pins, and these have been
  known to pop off in shipping.
<p>
 <li>If you need to increase the input to start or obtain any sort of response
  but then must back it off substantially to reduce the tube current to the
  proper value, low starting voltage or one of the other related problems
  is indicated.
<p>
  Assuming the power supply and wiring check out and the tube is good, the
  only solution is to boost the starting voltage or use a different type of
  starting circuit (inverter instead of voltage multiplier, for example).
<p>
 <li>You may have an extremely hard-to-start tube.  Whether this is just
  normal for your particular model tube or this particular sample, is due to
  it being old or unused for a long time, it is just tired with many hours
  under its belt, or some other problem, the result is that the specified
  starting voltage does not have any effect.
<p>
  Note that newly manufactured tubes requiring more than a second or so to
  start using a compatible power supply are usually rejected as defective and
  may end up in the hands of surplus dealers who may sell them as 'new' even
  though they don't meet specs.  Thus, you may be more likely to end up with
  one of these hard starting tubes!
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a particular tube doesn't start right away because the tube itself
   is hard starting, cycle the power supply on and off a few times at about 1
   second intervals.  If it's going to start, it usually will by the third
   or forth try.  I suppose the rapid rate of rise of the starting voltage
   does something useful. :)  (How well this works will depend on the actual
   tube and power supply but most power supplies should survive the abuse.)
   While probably not a long term solution, if the tube starts, at least you
   know it isn't dead.
<p>
  <li>If the voltage doesn't discharge in a reasonable amount of time after
   powering down due to a lack of bleeder resistor, it may help to discharge
   the capacitance of the tube and power supply manually with a <i>well
   insulated</i> high value resistor (a few hundred k ohms to a few M ohms)
   before attempting to restart.  Again, the rapid rate of rise of the
   starting voltage helps to ionize the gas.  Where the tube starts
   reliably when this is done, it may be possible to add a high value (e.g.,
   several hundred M ohm) resistor permanently across the power supply output.
<p>
  <li>For HeNe laser tubes with exposed bores like Spectra-Physics side-arm
   tubes, touching various glass parts of the tube (NOT the high voltage
   connections!) might also provide a capacitive path for the starting pulse.
   This applies more to pulse starters or those with s substantial component of
   high voltage AC, not the typical voltage multiplier with a DC output.
   Older Spectra-Physics exciters tend to have up to 50 percent of the starting
   voltage in the form of an AC waveform.  Double check that the laser head
   case is grounded - a missing ground may result in starting problems.  (More
   on this below.)
<p>
  <li>Shine a light on the bore in various places to see if that has any
   effect.  On high mileage (probably) tubes, as with high mileage neon
   lamps or fluorescent lamp starters, a few photons can help ionize the gas.
   This isn't that common but is easy enough to check.
<p>
   And, it may not only be high mileage tubes.  I recently discombobulated
   (translation: disassembled to harvest its organs) a vintage HeNe laser-based
   LaserDisc player and found a little incandescent lamp buried near the
   bore of the laser tube.  It is even documented in the service manual
   (which includes the assembly procedure for the optical pickup),
   but there is no discussion as to its purpose.  However, the way it's wired
   in suggests that the lamp is not in the original design.  The
   only possible explanation is that it was there to help a possibly hard
   starting HeNe laser to start.  It must have been included to
   be able to use tubes that otherwise would fail to start quickly enough.
   I've seen this before with an HP-5501B, and later with several HP-5517Bs,
   that had a similar quirk: With the cover off, they would start.  But
   with the cover on, they could take a minute or more to start.  Nonetheless,
   for a manufacturer to deliberately add a light bulb to aid starting
   in a production unit is so strange.  Well, I did have a professor
   whose motto was "If it works, use it". :)  That's also my motto
   for repairing the HP lasers!
<p>
  <li>Another test is to try the tube with reverse polarity on its input.
   Connect the positive output of the power supply to the ballast resistor
   (don't omit this!) and then to the cathode (can electrode) end of the
   HeNe tube.  Connect the negative of the power supply to the anode of the
   tube.  You are only doing this for testing!  Do not be tempted to leave
   the tube wired this way permanently should it actually start.
<p>
   Based on tubes I have tested, the starting voltage is much lower with the
   anode and cathode connections interchanged.  However, the voltage drop
   across the tube when running with reverse polarity is much higher than
   with correct polarity.  Thus, the tube may not run within the normal
   operating voltage range of your power supply even if the discharge is
   initiated - more likely it will just pulse.
<p>
   Nonetheless, even if it just pulses, at least you know the tube is not
   totally dead.  If the tube is otherwise undamaged, there should also be
   an indication of (at least weak) laser output from the business end of
   the tube.  Perhaps, all you need is a power supply with higher starting
   and/or operating voltage.  An inverter type starter using a flyback
   transformer appears to be particularly good for hard-to-start tubes.
   Unfortunately, I do not know of any reliable way of determining the
   likelihood of success without actually trying it.
<p>
   I have one 5 mW HeNe tube that requires (depending on its mood) as much
   as 15 to 20 kV to start (it should be less than about 10 kV).  However,
   once started, it runs with a normal operating voltage of about 1,800 VDC.
<p>
   WARNING: Do not let the HeNe tube run for any length of time with reverse
   polarity as damage may occur due to heating and sputtering at the anode
   end of the tube.
<p>
  <li>Carefully heating the tube (with a hair dryer, NOT a propane torch!) may
   help to get it started in some cases.  I've only heard of one instance of
   this and have not tried it myself but it should be easy to experiment.  A
   tube that responds to this treatment is probably one what just has trouble
   starting the first time after being off for awhile but restarts easily
   when warm.  However, what may really be going on is that you are heating
   the power supply circuit board nearby reducing leakage in the anode
   circuit (see above) or bringing a ground in close proximity to the tube
   (see below).
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <p>
<li>Tube flashes occasionally for the very briefest of instant, possibly at
 random intervals.  There may or may not be a laser beam accompanying the
 flashes.  Depending on the situation, it may just appear to give up and
 revert to (1), above.  This may be a protective feature of certain power
 supplies or an indication that the starting pulse is being diverted by
 an electrical leakage path, corona, or arcing somewhere.
<p>
 This sort of behavior is probably more likely with a pulse type starter but
 can occur with other types as well.  What is likely happening is that the
 energy is insufficient to fully ionize the gas inside the bore of the HeNe
 tube so the discharge doesn't 'catch'.
<p>
 In addition to the other possibilities listed above and below:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Check for missing grounds.  Where a pulse starter is used or a marginally
  compatible power supply where the high rate of rise of the starting voltage
  is needed to start it is possible that like many fluorescent lamp fixtures,
  a grounded metal plate is needed near or in contact with the tube to provide
  a capacitive path to aid initial ionization of the gas.  Operating the laser
  (or fixture) on an ungrounded outlet, not installing a foil shield or not
  properly grounding it, or replacing the HeNe tube with one that doesn't
  have such a 'feature', might result in erratic starting - perhaps no action
  at all or maybe an occasional flash but not actually remaining on or taking
  a long and random time to 'catch'.  If putting your hand on the tube
  (carefully avoiding the high voltage terminals!) results in consistent
  starting, lack of proper grounding would be confirmed.  (This applies to
  uncooperative fluorescent fixtures as well.)  Add a wrap of aluminum or
  copper foil and attach it to earth ground.  I have only heard of one case
  that might have been due to a missing ground so I suspect this is quite
  an unlikely scenario!
 <p>
 <li>Make sure the anode leads are as short as possible to minimize stray
  capacitance.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Tube flashes momentarily - longer than an instant possibly up to a second
 or two - but does not 'catch'.  During the time the discharge is on, there
 is a laser beam.
<p>
 What happens is that the discharge is initiated but the voltage drops too
 much at the tube anode and the discharge goes out.  This cycle repeats
 resulting in a flashing HeNe laser.
<p>
 To produce a stable discharge, the following must be satisfied:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The sum of the effective resistance of the power supply and the ballast
  resistor and the (incremental) negative resistance of the tube (dV/dI at
  the operating point) must be greater than 0.
<p>
 <li>The voltage across the tube must be above the minimum for the tube at the
  operating current.
<p>
 <li>The current must be above the minimum for the tube/power supply/ballast
  resistor combination.
 </ul>
<p>
 These factors are not independent.  Since the negative resistance and
 sustaining voltage of the tube are not normally specified and depend on
 current, some amount of trial and error may be required to achieve
 consistent stable operation but in most cases it really is very easy.
<p>
 Cycling behavior can be due to several factors:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Poor power supply voltage regulation or excessive ripple.  Until the
  tube fires, there is essentially no load on the supply resulting in much
  greater voltage than under load.  Except for a high compliance type of
  design where this is needed to produce the starting voltage, minimizing
  this difference will improve stability and reduce the voltage needed for
  stable operation.
<p>
  If the transformer or inverter drops too much under load, the tube voltage
  may fall below the minimum for the tube/ballast combination as soon as it
  starts.  This cycle will repeat continuously or it occasionally may catch.
<p>
  Use a higher voltage and larger ballast resistor, and/or increase the uF
  value of the main filter capacitor (and/or the one in the DC supply to an
  inverter type supply as well if it isn't regulated).
<p>
  Minimum capacitor values for less than 5 percent voltage ripple (typical
  voltage and current requirements):
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Line operated supplies: .5 to 1 uF (2000 V, 5 mA).
  <li>Inverter output: .005 to .01 uF (10 kHz, 1,800 V, 4 mA).
  <li>Unregulated inverter input: 15,000 to 20,000 uF (12 V, 1 A).
  </ul>
<p>
  Actual ripple in the current to the tube may be several times greater
  than this since it depends on the change in voltage with respect to the
  total effective resistance of the PS+tube+ballast resistor combination).
  However, the resulting ripple in the optical output power will be 2 to 10
  times lower than the ripple in the current depending on operating point.
  The lowest will occur around the tube's optimal current specification.
<p>
 <li>Ballast resistor too large for the operating voltage.  The operating
  current falls too low resulting in increased (magnitude of) negative
  resistance.  Once the total system resistance goes negative, the
  discharge becomes unstable and goes out.  The result is a flashing laser
  like a neon bulb relaxation oscillator.
<p>
  For an unregulated power supply, increase the operating voltage and/or
  decrease the ballast resistance.
<p>
  For a regulated power supply, decrease the ballast resistance so that the
  voltage for the desired operating current falls within its compliance range.
<p>
 <li>Too much stray capacitance and/or inductance in anode circuit.  The
  system is behaving like a relaxation oscillator as the capacitance
  charges and then discharges through the tube.  The wiring inductance
  causes the current from the main supply to lag too far behind the
  starting current and the discharge goes out.
<p>
  Shorten the wiring - minimize the distance between the power supply
  and ballast resistor, the ballast resistor, and tube anode, and don't
  use long runs of high voltage coax (which may have higher capacitance).
  Increasing the energy of the starting circuit slightly may help as well.
<p>
 <li>For laser heads in particular, the additional capacitance resulting from
  the metal case may increase the minimum stable tube current by up to 1 mA
  or more - and thus require changes in the power supply and/or ballast
  resistor.  So, if you tested the HeNe tube and power supply on your
  workbench but the enclosed system is unstable, this may be the reason.
<p>
 <li>Power supply polarity is reversed.  The voltage drop across a HeNe tube
  operated with the cathode and anode interchanged is higher than under
  normal conditions.  However, required starting voltage is much lower.
  The result is likely to be a pulsing laser.  Double check your wiring
  and terminal connections.  I have also seen commercial power supplies
  mislabeled!  See the section <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm1">Making
  Measurements on HeNe Laser Power supplies</A> if you need to actually
  test for reverse polarity.
 </ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrhsht">About Hard Start HeNe Tubes</A></h3>

As noted elsewhere, apparently identical HeNe tubes made on the same
production line may differ widely in their starting performance.  While one
sample may start absolutely instantly, another one that is indistinguishable
may take several minutes to wink on.  A newly manufactured HeNe tube that
requires more than a second or so to start using a compatible power supply is
generally rejected as defective.  Guess who may end up with these - surplus
dealers, and ultimately, you!  The condition may get worse with use so some
high mileage tubes could indeed be a lot worse in this department - possibly
to the point of being virtually impossible to start even if they were within
spec when new.
<p>
As far as I can determine, the fundamental physics behind this phenomenon may
not even be well understood by the major laser companies.  The only meaningful
data is statistical, because even a give tube with a given power supply will
have dramatically different start times from attempt to attempt, as will tubes
built side-by-side through the entire production process.
<p>
Tubes that are kept in dark cold environments for long periods of time don't
tend to start well.  But, once one of these tubes is started successfully,
restarts will likely be instantaneous, or at least reasonably quick.  However,
left overnight, they will revert to being uncooperative.
<p>
Also lower fill pressures and cleaner tubes make for hard starting - not to
mention power supply variables.
<p>
Some manufacturers (e.g., Melles Griot) use a conductive 'start-tape' running
the length of the tube attached to the anode electrode to aid in starting.
It's not even really <i>proven</i> that this improves performance (and I've
found that it can be a source of electrical breakdown problems.  I've never
noticed any difference in the speed of starting after removing the start-tape).
Uniphase had a pointed electrode inside the anode mirror sleeve to aid in
starting but it isn't obvious that it made any statistical difference either.
There has even been talk of using a trace of radioactive gas (as used to be
common in neon indicator lamps and glow tube fluorescent starters), but this
of course would probably not be a popular idea today!
<p>
A given production line may still have hard-start related yield problems from
time to time (which kind of suggests the Ph.D physicists don't understand it).
Funny thing is, no one can tell anything that's different on a hard-starter
versus a regular one.

<h4><A NAME="htraasw">Adding a Start Wire</A></h4>

As noted elsewhere, many HeNe laser heads have some type of starting wire or
start tape running from the anode along the tube to the vicinity of the
cathode.  In most cases, this actually has little or no effect on starting,
and may end up becoming a problem where electrical leakage can cause
starting problems.  The reason it doesn't usually help is that with
the common coaxial tube construction with a full length gas reservoir,
the electric field produced by the high dV/dt of the initial starting voltage
rise can't be anywhere near the bore, where it's needed.  This is particularly
bad with Melles Griot and Aerotech tube construction since the discharge path
is not near the glass surface anywhere.  On Hughes and NEC tubes, there is a
location near the cathode where the center of the tube is exposed.
<p>
For some hard start tubes that otherwise run well without current drop out
problems, adding a start wire directly from the anode with a few turns wrapped
around the tube near the cathode may help starting dramatically.  For example,
on Spectra-Physics side-arm laser tubes, there is a section next to where
the cathode attaches to the main bore where adding a start wire may work
quite well.  This allowed an SP-155 which would almost never start at
normal line voltage to start instantly first time every time.
<p>
Use a well insulated wire connected before the ballast resistors.
Wrap the end a few times around the narrowest section of the tube near
the cathode or use a metal clip.  Some experimentation may be required.
Just try not to zap yourself excessively during testing. :)
<p>
However, if used with a some linear power supplies having a voltage multiplier
starter (probably without a final diode/filter stage), the tube must run
stably substantially above its lower current dropout point or else the
start wire will tend to turn the tube off as well as turn it on and the
result will be a flashing laser, which is usually not a good thing.
Adding a HV diode in series with the start wire might help, but I haven't
tried it.
<p>
As added protection for you and the power supply, instead of connecting
the start wire directly to the raw high voltage output, install a series
capacitor with bleeder.  I would suggest 1 nF with a 100M ohm resistor
across it.  Both should be rated for the peak starting voltage
available from the power supply, typically 8 to 15 kV.

<h3><A NAME="htrhtt2">Possible Causes of No Output with a Normal Discharge
 Glow</A></h3>

Where the HeNe tube starts - there is a stable glow discharge and it is the
correct color (bright white-ish red-orange, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My Tube is Good?</A>), there
are a few possibilities that are not due to a bad HeNe tube or laser head:
<p>
<ul>
<li>For a laser head, the shutter may be closed.  Open it. :)
<p>
<li>Your HeNe tube current may be way too high due to a faulty power supply
 regulator, incorrect setting of your Variac, or a defective current meter.
 An increase of 25% beyond optimum may just reduce the beam power somewhat.
 However, if the current is too high by a factor of 2 or 3 or more, there may
 be no output at all.  Very low tube current can also do this but it isn't
 usually possible to maintain a stable discharge at much below the optimal
 current.
<p>
<li>You may actually have an IR HeNe laser tube.  The beam is just not visible
 (which makes for a really boring light show).  However, acquiring one of
 these isn't that likely as IR HeNe tubes are pretty rare compared to the
 common red variety.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht1">HeNe
 Tubes of a Different Color</A>.  One way to tell is by the color of the
 mirrors: Mirrors for normal red HeNe tubes have a gold or copper color (by
 reflection) and appear blue/green by transmitted light (viewed through the
 ends of an UNPOWERED tube!).  IR mirrors may appear quite transparent by
 comparison with a neutral coloration.  In fact, they may just look like
 pieces of clear glass!
<p>
<li>Some long high power visible HeNe lasers may require a series of magnets
 along the side of the tube to suppress spectral lines that do not contribute
 to gain at the lasing wavelength.  If these magnets are not present, output
 power may be reduced or conceivably there may be no output beam at all.
 However, I would not expect magnets to be required for common HeNe tubes
 under 15 mW although some smaller lab quality lasers may also use magnets,
 possibly to stabilize the optical output or polarization of the beam.  See
 the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henmag">Magnets in High Power or Precision
 HeNe Laser Heads</A>.
</ul>
<p>
And, for other-color HeNe tubes which have much lower gain for a given length
than red HeNes, all of the above may apply.  The following comments were
prompted by questions about a non-lasing short green HeNe tube (similar to a
Melles Griot 05-LGR-024, 215 mm in length:
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
Those things are touchy, touchy, little SOBs.  They usually have an almost
flat HR and OC combination.  If it does lase, it will probably be a few tenths
of a mW at best.  Probably have to walk the beam AND tweak both ends for any
hope.  Try some magnets too, for 3.39 micron suppression.  In general, low
power greens are a bitch to tweak.
<p>
Note that the green discharge is more 'pink' (red tubes more 'orange').  Fill
mixture is a little different, but the different color mostly due to lower
fill pressure - which is why greens have shorter lifetimes than red.

<h3><A NAME="htrhttl">Possible Causes of Low Output with a Normal Discharge
 Glow</A></h3>

Where the discharge color is normal and the tube current is known to be
reasonably correct but the output is weak, there can be a variety of causes.
(Of course, most of this also applies to <i>no output</i> but this is covered
in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt">HeNe Tube Problems and
Testing</A>.)  The following applies when the output power just isn't
as great as expected:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Need for mirror alignment.  Over many temperature cycles, mirror alignment
 can change enough to cut down output power substantially.  I've found a 50
 percent reduction to be not terribly unusual.  Careful mirror tweaking can
 often restore the tube to near new performance.
<p>
<li>Damage to bore supports.  A tube that has been dropped may suffer from
 a malady whereby the metal spider or other structure that keeps the bore
 centered is pushed out of line.  The bore will no longer be centered and
 may even be slightly warped.  It may be possible to whack the tube in such
 a way to get it back in line but probably not that likely.  Realigning one
 or both mirrors might help some if the warp isn't too great.
<p>
<li>Broken bore.  Part of the bore - capillary - may have fractured and may
 be found rattling around inside the tube.  What's remaining may still permit
 the tube to lase at reduced power if the broken part isn't blocking the beam
 path but there's no hope of repair.
<p>
<li>End-of-life tube.  Over the course of a HeNe laser tube's life, the power
 will change.  If the tube was slightly overfilled, it may actually
 increase for a period of time before gradually decreasing until near
 end-of-life, at which point it may drop to zero within a few hundred hours.
 It is actually not that commone to find a tube that lases weakly due to
 end-of-life, even on the surplus market.
<p>
<li>Damaged mirror due to sputtering or overheating.  This is quite possible
 for a near end-of-life tube.  It may also occur from operating with reverse
 polarity (or with the negative output of the power supply to the mirror mount
 instead of cathode terminal for Hughes style tubes) for more than a couple
 minutes either overcoating the mirror or overheating and damaging the coating
 of the mirror near whatever structure is acting (incorrectly) as the cathode.
 I've seen this happen on a SP-084 tube driven from an ignition coil AC power
 supply.  It may also occur due to a bad internal connection between the
 cathode-end  mirror mount and cathode can.  Then, the discharge takes place
 inside the mirror mount eventually damaging the mirror.
<p>
<li>Neutral density filter.  It's a feature, not a bug. :)  Some HeNe laser
 heads actually have filters built into the output end-cap to cut down on
 power.  Why?  The customer's specifications probably called for a maximum
 power rating for some regulatory reason (for their particular application).
 Since there is no way to change the output power of a HeNe laser electrically
 over a wide range, an easy solution is to just cut it down with a filter.
 That way, even a lively batch of tubes can be used - the manufacturer doesn't
 have to construct weak tubes on purpose.
<p>
 For example, I found that some recent samples of the popular Melles Griot
 05-LHR-911 HeNe laser head, rated at 1 mW minimum power output, were all
 made with neutral density filters to assure that the <i>maximum</i> power
 output was less than 1.5 mW.  With the filters removed, it jumped to between
 1.8 and 2.1 mW!  Apparently, the filters were individually selected to get
 the lasers as close as possible to 1.5 mW without exceeding it since their
 attenuations were not all the same and the weakest laser in the batch (with
 the filter) actually ended up having the hottest tube.
<p>
<li>Other symptoms of a tube that have no cure include: Peak output power
 (what of it there is) occurs for an operating current significantly above
 the rated optimum current due to low fill pressure (red tubes only; for
 some "other color" tubes, this may be normal) and output power declines
 as the tube warms up even with confirmed good mirror alignment.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrdoug">Doughnut Mode Beam from TEM00 HeNe Laser</A></h3>

Occasionally, a HeNe (or other) laser designated as TEM00 will actually
output a beam which looks like a doughnut or torus - with a hole in the
middle.  It's running with a not quite TEM00 mode structure - a doughnut mode.
Since this should be a TEM00 laser with a single transverse mode Gaussian
beam profile, that's normally considered a bug.  If it's outputting
decent power (compared to its specifications), the cause isn't likely
to be dirt inside the tube or imperfect mirror alignment.
<p>
More likely, the manufacturer accidentally used too large a bore for the
length of the resonator and the mirror curvature.  For example, if this
is a green (543.5 nm) HeNe laser, they may have used a bore sized for a
red (632.8 nm) HeNe laser by mistake resulting in a mode diameter that
is too large.  Or, it might have been designed on the hairy edge, size-wise,
in an attempt to get as much power as possible out of the tube and
the engineers weren't lucky that day.  With a correctly sized
bore, slightly incorrect mirror alignment would result in lower power but
maintain a TEM00 beam profile.
<p>
If you had been the original owner, the laser might have been replaced
under warranty.  As it is, you now have what I generally call an
"interesting" laser. :)  Or, since the specifications are often only with
respect to "95% mode purity", if the hole represents less than 5 percent
of the power, maybe it's considered acceptable, though I can't imagine
anyone being entirely happy with a laser that's supposed to be TEM00
having a hole in the middle of the beam unless all they care about is
the number of photons per second!
<p>
However, even with too wide a bore, it may be possible to adjust the
mirror alignment to obtain a TEM00 beam.  Gain access to the cathode-end
mirror mount (to avoid a shocking experience) and allow the laser to
warm up completely in the orientation that will be used.  Aim the laser at a
screen of some sort like a white business card, and gently press sideways
on the mirror mount from orientations every 45 degrees or so (top,
bottom, left, right, and the diagonals).  Closely
examine the spot shape to see if it pops into TEM00 at any time while
still maintaining near-maximum power.  If it does, it should be possible to
adjust the alignment as described in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>.
A power meter will be useful to assure that the output power is
still near maximum.  It may in fact end up being maximum with the
TEM00 beam, though some other beam profile when cold.  Very likely,
the alignment will be very critical.  Several attempts with multiple
warmup cycles (to allow the metal mirror mount stems to settle in) may
be needed to achieve consistent behavior.  I adjusted a green
HeNe laser head that formerly had a doughnut beam.  It now starts out
TEM01 but becomes a beautiful TEM00 once it warms up, and significantly
exceeds spec'd power.  But I haven't decided whether a consistently interesting
doughnut beam or a boring high quality TEM00 beam only when warmed up is
preferable. :)  CAUTION: You could make the laser worse or dead
by attempting mirror alignment.  So unless you've done this successfully
before, it may be best to leave well enough alone and enjoy the unusual
behavior.  There's nothing else you can do about it!

<h3><A NAME="htrhtt3">Unstable or Flickering HeNe Tube</A></h3>

Where your HeNe tube starts and lases normally but is unstable, flickering or
going out and then restarting whenever the power line voltage dips slightly or
for no apparent reason, the problem may be power supply or HeNe tube related.
It is also not unusual for this to start happening after the system has been
on for awhile due to characteristics of one or more of the components changing
slightly.  The following are not mutually exclusive:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The power supply's specifications may not match the requirements of the
 HeNe tube.  Operating voltage may be marginal, the current may be too low,
 the ballast resistor may be incorrect, capacitance between the power
 supply/ballast resistor and the HeNe tube anode may be excessive, or an
 additional cathode ballast resistor may be required for stability (mostly
 larger lasers mounted in metal exclosures).  If there is a current adjustment
 on your supply (including 'bricks'), try turning it up slightly - this may be
 all it needs!
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsrtc0">Basic HeNe Laser Power Supply
 Considerations</A>.
<p>
<li>The input to the power supply may be incorrect or inadequate.  You may be
 feeding only 115 VAC to a unit configured for 230 VAC, sharing the AC line
 with a whole-house air conditioner which causes major line dips when its
 compressor kicks in, only providing 9 VDC to a 12 VDC brick, or using a
 simple wall adapter when a well filtered or regulated DC source is required.
 So, first check the input to the power supply before ripping everything
 apart!
<p>
<li>For laser heads in particular, the additional capacitance resulting from
 the metal case may increase the minimum stable tube current by up to 1 mA or
 more - and thus require changes in the power supply and/or ballast resistor.
 So, if you tested the HeNe tube and power supply on your workbench but the
 enclosed system is unstable, this may be the reason.
<p>
<li>Also for mounted tubes and laser heads, arcing may be taking place inside
 the potted ballast resistor (in the end cap), elsewhere inside the tube
 enclosure, power supply, or even in the connecting cable - listen carefully
 for a snapping or sizzling sound at all these locations.  With a fault of
 this type, the tube would likely not start reliably or at all, but erratic
 operation once started is possible as well.  Note that this type of problem
 may have been caused originally by extended attempts at starting a very
 hard-to-start HeNe tube - the insulation may not have been capable of
 handling the 10+ kV starting voltage continuously.  Sometimes, that
 infamous "starting tape" that Melles Griot is so fond of might arc
 to the cylinder.  Just peel it off of the anode mirror mount and push
 what's left down inside where it can't do any harm.  You won't miss it.
<p>
 However, a faint clicking or snapping sound may actually be normal during
 starting if the power supply uses a pulse starting technique or is cycling
 a PWM controller attempting to start.
<p>
 Also see the sections: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My
 Tube is Good?</A> and <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt1">Starting Problems and
 Hard-to-Start Tubes</A>.
<p>
<li>There may be a bad connection in the wiring between the power supply
 and the tube.  Even with a small gap in the wire, the power supply may appear
 to start and run the laser but it's working hard and very likely, erratic
 behavior will be the result.  The laser may not be stable at the spec'd
 current, may not run except at a higher input voltage to the power supply,
 may drop out and restart randomly, or may just flicker.  Sometimes, ballast
 resistors fail open, possibly due to having run at a higher than normal
 current.  For laser heads, the problem may be inside the head itself or in
 the Alden connector, its connections, or even corroded or loose contacts.
 The potted ballast resistor(s) may be bad.  I've seen cases
 where the anode wire came loose and was just hanging near the anode of
 the tube and where the ballast resistors had overheated and were open,
 but the laser still ran - sort of.  It may also smell bad after running
 this way for awhile. :)
<p>
<li>The power supply current setting may be too low.  If you are attempting to
 run a HeNe tube rated for 6 mA on a power supply providing only 3 mA, the
 discharge may be unstable.  Some are adjustable (or can be easily modified).
 Increasing the ballast resistance (but this will also increase the
 opearing voltage) and/or moving the ballast resistors closer to the
 tube anode may also help.
<p>
<li>The power supply operating voltage may be too low.  It may be possible to
 boost this by using a Variac (0 to 140 VAC) or by selecting a different tap
 on the power transformer.  Sometimes, adding some additional main filter
 capacitance will help since this will reduce ripple and raise the valleys of
 the operating voltage.
<p>
<li>The ballast resistance may be too low (more common) or too high (less
 common).  Although most HeNe laser tubes will be happy with around 75K
 ohms, some are quite finicky. :)  On a healthy tube, increasing the
 ballast resistance will often result in a dramatic decrease in the dropout
 current - the lowest current at which the discharge will be stable.  So,
 if the recommended or nominal current setting (for maximum output power)
 results in a laser that flickers, sputters, or constantly restarts,
 increasing the ballast may help.  Similar problems may occur is the
 ballast resistance is too high.  Measure it to see what's actually
 there.  Perhaps a tube that inhabited this laser head previously needed
 a larger ballast, or the ballast stack has overheated due to some other
 fault and changed value.
<p>
<li>The ballast resistance may be too far from the anode.  A distance of
 2 to 3 inches from the anode terminal to the last resistor is usually
 acceptable, but some tube/power supply/cylinder combinations may benefit
 from putting it closer - 1/2 inch or less if possible.
<p>
<li>The power supply may be broken.  This could be due to component failure or
 degradation (i.e., dried up electrolytic capacitors), or even from excessive
 current leakage due to very high humidity).  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm2">Testing a HeNe Laser Power Supply</A>.
<p>
<li>The gas fill pressure of the HeNe tube may be incorrect due to age, use,
 or manufacturing error.  This will affect the operating voltage so that even
 a supposedly compatible power supply may not work reliably.  Behavior may
 change with warmup.  In fact, the operating voltage on good HeNe tubes may
 increase slightly as they warm up so instability may only appear after
 running for a few minutes if the tube and power supply aren't quite matched
 or if the power supply isn't set up correctly even if the tube is fine.
<p>
<li>High mileage HeNe tubes may require a higher operating (and/or starting)
 voltage than when new (think of all those flickering neon indicator lamps on
 your ancient ham rig or not-so-old outlet strips).
<p>
<li>The tube may be connected backwards or incorrectly!!!!  Reverse polarity
 will often result in an unstable discharge (even though the tube will lase).
 The tube may start more easily, but will be ruined in a very short time.
 Or, if this tube has wire terminal connections like those from Hughes,
 one or both mirror mounts may NOT be where the power is supposed to attach!
<p>
<li>There may be a bad internal connection between the HeNe tube's cathode
 and the adjacent mirror mount.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhspu">Sputtering or Erratic HeNe Tube</A>.
</ul>
<p>
A different power supply or slight adjustments or modifications may make your
HeNe tube happy, at least temporarily.  However, where the HeNe tube is an
inexpensive vanilla flavored variety, replacement may be the easiest solution
if it turns out to be marginal. :-)

<h3><A NAME="htrspu">Sputtering or Erratic HeNe Tube</A></h3>

This behavior is somewhat similar to the some of the compatibility problems
described above.  However, it could be much more random and may only occur
during warmup.
<p>
The symptoms are that the tube may start normally but then go off and restart,
possibly quickly and unpredictably.  One possible cause is a bad internal
connection between the cathode can and its attachment to the mirror mount
where the negative lead of the power supply is hooked up.  The type of
construction susceptible to this malady is where a 'nipple' on the end of the
aluminum cathode can is swaged (pressed/squished) into the mirror mount rather
than actually being attached by spot welding or via a spring contact.  After
many thermal cycles, the swage can loosen resulting in intermittent contact
especially as the tube heats and parts expand.  (This is sort of the same
problem that aluminum house wiring can have if improper termination techniques
or devices are used, but in that case, the consequences
can be much more disastrous!)  Any sort of high resistance
increases the required tube voltage since the mirror mount has a higher
'cathode fall' voltage drop.   The discharge will likely go out and the power
supply will then attempt to restart.  In some cases, the discharge may strike
to the mirror mount itself (look for a glow near the mirror) and if this
persists, will eventually destroy the mirror.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmdim">Damage to Mirror Coatings of Internal Mirror
Laser Tubes</A>)  After the tube warms up sufficiently, since aluminum expands
faster than steel or Kovar, the problem may disappear once the connection
tightens.  However, until then, the intermittent contact and many restarts is
hard on the power supply and nearby mirror.
<p>
Assuming the power supply and tube are properly matched and the power supply
isn't defective, this is a defective HeNe tube.  No cure is possible.  This
is a relatively unusual problem (I've only seen it in two (2) HeNe laser tubes
so far) so first check external connections and make sure your HeNe tube and
power supply are properly matched.  If its maximum voltage is marginal, as
the tube heats up, the voltage drop may increase just enough to result in
erratic behavior.  However, one possible difference between this and a bad
cathode connection is that with the latter, the condition may clear up once
the tube heats up since the expansion of the aluminum cathode will improve
contact.  The marginal voltage situation will just get worse.  The power
supply itself could also be defective.  The easiest way to determine which
is at fault is to swap the PSU and/or tube with known good units.
<p>
I've seen this malady on a few older Melles Griot HeNe lasers.  On newer ones,
a thin metal conductor has been added - presumably in response to this type of
failure - connecting the spider/bore support (which is in good contact with
the cathode can) directly to the end-cap.  It is spot welded at both ends.
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt3">Unstable or Flickering
HeNe Tube</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htraldp">Alden Connector Problems and Repair</A></h3>

While Alden connectors rarely give problems, a loose or
corroded contact inside the plastic shell can result in all sorts of
intermittent behavior including hard starting and repeated restarts or
flickering, as well as possible power supply failure.
Though rare, arcing is also possible from a damaged cable,
generally where a HV coax enters the Alden shell.  Any heating of the
Alden connector - even if NOT accompanied by 6 foot flames - is an
indication of trouble with the contacts as there
should be absolutely no detectable power dissipation in the connector! :)
So, before you blame the laser head or power supply, make sure the Alden
connections are secure.
<p>
The male pins can be cleaned with a file or fine sandpaper.  The female
contacts can be tightened by wedging a small flat-blade screwdriver inside
the connector between the side and the plastic contact support.  Entire
replacement Alden connectors are readily available or can be salvaged from
dead laser heads or power supplies.  To avoid the possibility of arcing
or a shocking experience, use at least 2 layers of heat-shrink tubing for
insulation with a minimum of 3/4" beyond the bare wire sections, and stagger
the splices.  Add another layer of heat-shrink over the completed splices.

<h3><A NAME="htrhtt4">Cyclical Variations in Output Beam Power</A></h3>

A HeNe laser that is in good condition will produce an output beam that is
quite stable and will have no visible (at least by eye) variations in output
power though a laser power meter will show fluctuations over various time
scales of a few percent even after warmup unless it is high performance
amplitude stabilized laser.  A typical laser tube will have a "mode sweep"
specification of between 2 and 20 percent depending on type and size (smaller
tubes typically have poorer performance).  As the tube warms up, this
cycling will start out slowly, speed up and peak, and then taper off as
the system stabilizes thermally.
<p>
Note that if the discharge is actually going on and off, the cause is entirely
different - an incompatibility with the power supply, incorrect ballast
resistor, low line voltage, etc.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt3">Unstable or Flickering HeNe Tube</A>.
<p>
However, sometimes you will find a laser that exhibits significant periodic 
variations in output intensity even where the discharge is perfectly stable.
There are two types of phenomena depending on the period of the power cycles:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cycle time of a few seconds possibly with fluctuations that are quite erratic.
 One mechanism for this is longitudinal mode hopping - the same mode
 cycling effect mentioned above but with greater consequences due to thermal
 expansion of the resonator - the distance between the mirrors is gradually
 changing which results in favoring different modes.  The cause is usually
 low resonator gain.  Possible reasons for this include:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Loss of helium or other gas fill problem.
 <li>Misaligned or damaged (sputtered) mirrors.
 <li>Grossly incorrect (usually very high) discharge tube current.
 <li>Weakened or missing stabilization magnets (long or high precision lasers).
 <li>Low gain or end-of-life (especially "other color" like  yellow and green)
  laser.
 </ul>
<p>
 These result in fewer longitudinal modes having sufficient gain to sustain
 the lasing process.  As the resonator length changes, these lines move with
 respect to the gain curve of the lasing medium.  Where there is cyclic
 variation in output power, only a very few lines are of sufficient gain to
 sustain lasing and then only when they are near the peak of the gain curve.
 The tube stops lasing entirely when there are no lines with sufficient gain to
 sustain oscillation.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoo1">Longitudinal Modes of Operation</A>.
<p>
 High mileage tubes with low gas pressure and tubes that are leaky (usually
 soft-seal but not always) with a contaminated gas fill may produce a very
 weak beam that comes and goes in a similar manner.  (Such a tube may also
 be hard starting or erratic on its normal power supply independent of the
 slow fluctuation in in output power.)  Very short and very long tubes are
 more susceptible to these effects.  Short tubes have fewer possible
 longitudinal modes available so as the gain falls off with use, the
 variations become more pronounced.  Similar behavior may be present
 with some yellow and green tubes since their gain is so low to start
 with and everything is critical.
<p>
 For longer HeNe lasers, in addition to the mode sweeping at the output wavelength,
 there may be a longer period power variation due to power stealing by the unwanted
 3.39 um line if it isn't adequately suppressed by bore/mirror design or magnets.
 This would occur at a rate of 0.632.8/3.391 as fast as the 632.8 nm mode cycling
 (for a 632.8 nm laser).  If the laser output power is recorded over time, one would
 see the effect of the 3.391 um superimposed on the shorter one but it won't show up as a
 smooth variation - more like mountain peaks appearing within rolling hills. :)
<p>
 To confirm, try adding some medium strength magnets along the tube or head.  Experiment
 with the number and orientation of the magnets but a half dozen with alternating polarities
 along one side of the tube are typically adequate.  If the magnets reduce the amplitude of
 the 3.391 um fluctuations (and probably increase the average output power by up to 25
 percent or more), poor design is the likely cause.  Among other things, the mirrors are too
 reflective at 3.391 um.  Aside from installing the magnets permanently, there isn't much
 that can be done.
<p>
 A similar sort of varying intensity behavior will result if a polarizing
 filter is placed in the output beam of a randomly polarized HeNe tube or a
 HeNe tube that is supposed to be linearly polarized but isn't working properly
 because its internal Brewster plate has fallen off or its polarizing magnets
 have weakened or are mispositioned.  However, in this case, what happens is
 that as the laser switches between longitudinal modes and/or the mirror
 alignment shifts ever so slightly, the polarization angle and thus the output
 intensity of the beam may change significantly.  This is perfectly normal for
 a randomly polarized tube but indicates a problem with one that is supposed to
 be linearly polarized.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrurp">Unrandomizing the Polarization of a Randomly
 Polarized HeNe Tube</A>.
<p>
 (From: Daniel Lang (dbl@anemos.caltech.edu).)
<p>
 <blockquote>
 "The typical HeNe laser's gain curve is wide enough for 2 or 3 longitudinal
  modes to oscillate simultaneously.  As the laser warms up, the cavity
  expands, causing the modes to decrease in frequency.  When a mode gets too
  low with respect to the HeNe linewidth, it goes out and after a bit, a new
  one appears on the high side of the linewidth.  This typically has a period
  of 3 to 10 seconds.  I suspect that an old laser that is doing this is down
  to 1 or 2 modes due to reduced gain and may be approaching 0 or 1 mode,
  causing a visible intensity modulation.
<p>
  I noted a similar problem when using a HeNe for Laser Doppler Velocimetry.
  In this case we were seeing a low level intensity modulation that would start
  at approximately 60 Khz, sweep through zero and back to 60 Khz and then
  disappear for several seconds before starting again.  The entire cycle
  repeated in approximately 5 to 10 seconds.  The longitudinal mode spacing for
  our laser was 385 MHz.  The sweep between 0 and 60 kHz only appeared when the
  laser was operating in 3 modes.  The frequency difference between modes 1 and
  2 was not quite the same as the difference between modes 2 & 3 except when
  exactly symmetrical (amplitude of mode 1 = amplitude of mode 3).  We were
  seeing the difference of the differences!  The longer interval free of
  intensity modulation occurred when only 2 modes were oscillating."
 </blockquote>
<p>
 For more information on this phenomenon, see the section:
 <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henlmpl">Longitudinal Mode Pulling</A>.
<p>
<li>Cycle time of a few minutes with smooth, though possibly random variations.
 This may be due to thermal gradients from improper mounting and/or room air
 convection resulting in unequal heating of various portions of the tube,
 slight warping, and changes to mirror misalignment.  The longer the tube, the
 more likely this will be if it is not mounted properly in a thermally isolated
 environment like a cylindrical laser head.  The effect is easily
 demonstrated - let your favorite long HeNe tube warm up sitting on the bench
 while monitoring its output power.  Then, while watching your laser power
 meter, rest your hand on one side of the tube.  Almost immediately, output
 power will change - up or down depending on how well the mirrors were aligned
 in the first place and which side of the tube you touched!  HeNe tubes longer
 than 15 inches seem to be much more susceptible to this phenomenon.
<p>
 A simple test to confirm thermal gradients as the likely cause is to gently
 press on each mirror mount (careful: high voltage!), or perhaps even in the
 center of the tube if it is supported at each end.  If power can be restored
 to near normal no matter what its value by doing this (the direction and force
 required will not be constant), it is likely a thermal problem.
<p>
 Therefore, it is important to mount long higher power HeNe tubes both at the
 recommended locations (usually by gently clamping the glass near the ends of
 the tube) and in a case to promote temperature uniformity and isolate it from
 convection currents.  The alternative is messy: Active feedback to monitor
 output power and tweak the mirror mounts with a servo system. :)
 Long yellow and green HeNe laser tubes are particularly susceptible to
 very erratic behavior as a result of thermal effects.  If not mounted in
 a suitable enclosure, it may not be possible to achieve mirror alignment
 that results in stable output power and fluctuations of 100 percent could
 result.  In other words, the beam may vary in output power even to the
 point of disappearing entirely over a period of a few minutes.  In fact,
 Melles Griot will not even sell yellow, green, or other low gain HeNe
 laser tubes by themselves (not mounted in an enclosure) as standard products,
 at least in part for this reason.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrhtt5">Reasons for Short HeNe Tube Lifetime</A></h3>

As noted, sealed HeNe should last many thousands of hours with no noticeable
degradation in performance.
<p>
If you are experiencing excessively short life (e.g., a month instead of
years), the first things to check are operating current and polarity.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm1">Making Measurements on HeNe Laser
Power Supplies</A>.  Of course, if you omitted the ballast resistor, life will
likely be very short. :-(
<p>
If the HeNe tube and power supply are mismatched, one can damage the other.
For example, running a 1 mW HeNe tube on a power supply designed for a 35 mW
HeNe tube may not only result in too high a current by design (e.g., 8 mA
instead of 3 mA) but may also result in much higher current if the compliance
range of the power supply is exceeded (i.e., the voltage across the HeNe tube
is much lower than the power supply can handle).  Conversely, attempting to
power a 5 mW HeNe tube using the power supply from a barcode scanner (designed
for a .5 to 1 mW HeNe tube) will likely result in a blown power supply.  Just
because the high voltage connectors mate and/or the tube lights up doesn't
imply anything about compatibility!  Also note that maximum optical output
occurs at the optimum operating current - too high or too low and it goes down.
(Operating current for yellow, orange, and green HeNe tubes is even more
critical than for the common red variety so setting these up with an
adjustable power supply or adjusting the ballast resistance for maximum output
is recommended.)
<p>
New and even used HeNe tubes and power supplies from reputable surplus dealers
will generally last a long time if not abused.   But, much of what you get at
swap meets and hamfests has been pulled from equipment for one reason or
another.  So, the problems you are experiencing may have nothing to do with
your setup!
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
Speaking as a non-physicist....
<p>
There are so many variables in a gas discharge, it's a game of averages.
That's why the power supply business can be so tricky - and why, for the
power supplies you can look inside of, you see so many modifications.  That,
and the rate at which electronic components go obsolete keeps it in a
continuous state of flux (no pun intended).
<p>
Reasons for the variability in lifetime and failure mechanisms from design to
design revolve around design fill pressure and gas mix, operating current,
distance from capillary bore-end to cathode, optical design (some designs
are more sensitive to misalignment than others).  Also power supply
variability, ballast resistor value differences, operating current
tolerances (often set at, say, +/-0.2 mA).
<p>
Gas lasers can be a pain, but for a lot of applications, they're
still the most cost effective solution -- in some cases the only solution.

<h3><A NAME="htrpvdl">Power Variations Due to Lack of Mirror Substrate Wedge</A></h3>

The only surfaces of a HeNe laser cavity that should be aligned are those
of the two mirrors.  Any others that are perpendicular to the optic
axis will cause reflections that can affect the power and stability
of the laser by forming a Fabry-Perot etalon - a secondary resonant
cavity.  (Note that the following discussion does *not* deal with
the stability aspects of reflections - which is a very complex subject
unto itself - but only with how they affect the waste beam and main beam
output power.)  Perhaps surprisingly, the outer surfaces of the mirror
glass or substrate are a possible source of reflections that can cause
peculiarities, if not actual problems, in the laser's power stability.
Both the HR and OC mirrors can be at fault and affect the power from
the main beam out the front of the laser as well as the waste beam out
the back.  But it is power variations of the waste beam that are usually
most dramatic, except for some cases of goofups in manufacture, mostly
of "other color" lasers..
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>HR mirror:</b>
 The outer surface of the HR mirror of most HeNe laser tubes is ground
 and polished, but not AR coated.  With most higher quality HeNe lasers,
 the HR mirror inner and outer surfaces are ground at an angle - called
 wedge - to assure that the reflection of the waste beam from its outer
 surface won't go directly back into the laser cavity.  It's easy to tell
 if this is present on any given laser as there will be a very faint ghost
 beam at a slight angle (a few degrees) to the already faint waste beam.
 If there is no ghost beam, there is no wedge.  The result can be somewhat
 peculiar behavior, though usually it doesn't affect the overall performance
 of the laser by enough to matter since
 the most dramatic effect is usually to cause the waste beam power to
 vary dramatically as the tube warms up.  But there can be exceptions.
<p>
 If the HR mirror substrate was ground without any wedge, the coated
 mirror surface and the outer surface of the HR mirror glass will form
 a Fabry-Perot etalon or second resonant cavity whose transmission
 will depend both on the exact lasing wavelength (which is changing
 due to mode sweep) and its thickness (which is changing due to
 thermal expansion.  When the distance between the two surfaces of the
 HR mirror is a multiple of 1/2 wavelength (possibly plus 1/4
 wavelength since the outer surface is to a lower index of refraction)
 of a lasing mode, the reflection will be a maximum.  This will
 modulate the effective mirror reflectivity by a surprisingly large
 amount resulting in a corresponding variation in the waste beam
 power, as well as an inverse variation in main beam power.  For a
 normal red HeNe laser where the waste beam is perhaps 30 uW and the
 main beam is 1 mW, if the waste beam power changes by 100 percent (30
 uW to 60 uW), the main beam power will change by approximately 3
 percent.  So, this might go unnoticed under normal conditions.
 However, some applications use the waste beam to monitor the lasing
 modes, and for those, a tube with this malady is next to useless.
<p>
 So, now for the analysis.  (Don't worry, this isn't too bad.)
 As the laser tube heats up and expands, there will be the normal mode sweep
 for the resonator formed by the two mirrors as the longitudinal modes
 drift under the gain curve.  This results in a change of frequency within
 the Doppler-broadened neon gain curve over a range of about 1.5 GHz
 corresponding to a change in wavelength of roughly 2 picometers.  The
 total power of the main (output) beam then varies slightly due to differences
 in gain for the modes depending on their position on the gain curve.
<p>
 But, there will also be a smaller
 increase in the thickness of the HR mirror glass so there will be its own
 slower change in behavior.  For most HeNe lasers, the HR mirror has a
 reflectivity very close to 1 - 99.9% is typical.  The uncoated outer surface
 will have a reflectivity of around 4%.  If there is wedge, then the 4%
 reflection from the outer surface does little more than create the ghost
 beam.  But if these two surfaces are parallel, they form
 a Fabry-Perot etalon which can have an effective variation in transmission of
 up to 2.25:1 (if everything is perfect, more below), and this will cause a
 similar power variation in the waste beam and inverse power variation in
 the main beam.
<p>
 The relevant calculations are (1) to determine how the transmission function
 of the weak etalon of the HR mirror varies with temperature and (2) to
 determine the approximate number of variation cycles based on temperature
 rise.
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>
 The general transmission equation for a Fabry-Perot (plane parallel) etalon
 with arbitrary mirror reflectivities is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
                (1-R<sub>1</sub>)(1-R<sub>2</sub>)
  T = ---------------------------------
       [1-(R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>+4(R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>sin<sup>2</sup>(&phi;)
</PRE>
<p>
 Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>T = power transmission (Pout/Pin).
 <li>R<sub>1</sub> = reflectivity of mirror 1.
 <li>R<sub>2</sub> = reflectivity of mirror 2.
 <li>&phi; = phase shift for a round trip.
 </ul>
<p>
 This equation reduces to the more common one found via a Web search if
 R=R<sub>1</sub>=R<sub>2</sub>.  And indeed, since Tmax/Tmin for an etalon
 with R<sub>1</sub> very close to 1 and an arbitrary R<sub>2</sub> is the
 same as for an etalon with the reflectivity of both mirrors equal to
 R=sqrt(R<sub>2</sub>), solving one of those equations for
 R=sqrt(R<sub>2</sub>) will return a nearly identical result
 (though, of course, the actual transmission will differ dramatically!).
<p>
 So, for R<sub>1</sub> being the HR mirror with 99.9%R and
 R<sub>2</sub> being the outer surface with around 4%R, the equation
 reduces to:
<p>
<PRE>
                      0.001 * 0.96                           0.00096
   T = --------------------------------------------- = -------------------
        [1-(0.999*0.04)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>+4(0.999*0.04)<sup>1/2</sup>sin<sup>2</sup>(&phi;)     0.64+0.8*sin<sup>2</sup>(&&phi;)
</PRE>
<p>
 So, T varies by a factor of about 2.25 (Tmax/Tmin) due to the sin function
 going from 0 to 1 as phi changes due to thermal expansion of the mirror
 glass.  Note that the exact reflectivity of the HR doesn't
 alter this result by a significant amount as long as R<sub>1</sub> is close
 to 1.  Thus, that ratio of 2.25 for the maximum variation in HR transmission
 (1-R) will be essentially the same for any HeNe laser with a non-wedged but
 ground and polished HR mirror.
<p>
<PRE>
    Condition          Relative T
  ----------------------------------
    Min (&phi;=90&deg;)           0.67
    No Etalon             1.00
    Max (&phi;=0&deg;)            1.50
</PRE>
<p>
  But depending on the actual parallellism of the HR surfaces, and the
  condition of its outer surface, the ratio of 2.25:1 may not be achieved.
<p>
  Note that where the reflectivity of the HR is much closer to 1 than the
  reflectivity of the OC as with most red (632.8 nm) HeNe lasers, the power
  of the small waste beam will vary by a ratio of up to 2.25:1 but the power
  of the much larger main beam will only show very small inverse ripples.
  And the total power from both ends will be essentially constant.
  However, if the reflectivities of the HR and OC are similar - the power
  from both ends will vary significantly, though by much less than that
  ratio of 2.25:1.  For a very low gain laser, the total power will
  also get somewhat smaller as the HR transmission gets higher
  since it is running very near the lasing threshold even under
  the best of conditions.
<p>
<li>The number of power variation cycles during warmup is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
      Lm * n * (Cex + Cn) * (Tf - Ti)
 N = ---------------------------------
                  2 * &lambda;
</PRE>
<p>
 Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>N = number of power variation cycles.
 <li>Lm = physical length (thickness) of mirror substrate.
 <li>n = index of refraction.  (n = 1.517 for BK7 at 633 nm.)
 <li>Cex = temperature coefficient of thermal expansion for the mirror
  substrate. (Cex = 7.1x10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C for BK7.)
 <li>Cn = temperature coefficient of absolute index of refraction for the
  mirror substrate.  (Cn averages approximately 2x10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C
  for BK7 in the around 40 &deg;C.)
 <li>Tf = final temperature.
 <li>Ti = initial temperature.
 <li>&lambda; = vacuum wavelength of lasing line.
 </ul>
<p>
 Assuming the temperature of the mirror climbs from 20 &deg;C to 70 &deg;C
 during warmup, for a 4 mm thick mirror substrate, the optical length will
 increase by about 2.76 um or 8.7 half-wavelengths at 633 nm.
<p>
 Using a similar approach, the number of mode cycles for the main tube
 will be:
<p>
<PRE>
                                     Lc * Cex * (Tf - Ti)
            Number of Mode Cycles = ----------------------
                                            2 * &lambda;
</PRE>
<p>
 Where:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Lc = Distance between the (cavity) mirrors.
 <li>Cex = Temperature coefficient of thermal expansion for the tube.
  (Cex = 3.25x10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C for borosilicate glass.)
 </ul>
<p>
  For the same temperature rise, a laser head like a 05-LHR-171 with
  Lc of 400 mm, the distance between the mirrors will
  increase by about 65 um, corresponding to 205 cycles at 633 nm.
<p>
  For a bare tube, the temperature rise will be less, so both the number
  of mode sweep cycles and power variation cycles will be smaller.
</ol>
<p>
 It's easy to measure the power variation with any sort of optical power meter
 or even simply a silicon photodiode and a multimeter on the uA range.  There
 is no need to wait for the tube to warm up on its own to do this.  A small
 blow-dryer can be used alternately on the heat and no-heat settings to vary
 the temperature of the HR mirror mount up and down.  Or, if the waste beam
 is from the cathode-end of the tube, even finger warmth will work.  But
 trying this on the anode-end will result in a shocking experience!
<p>
 I built a little widget with a ThermoElectric Cooler (TEC, Peltier device)
 to do this more precisely for barcode scanner tubes, which tend to suffer
 from lack of HR wedge much more so than higher quality and larger HeNe laser
 tubes.  The TEC is clamped between a small plate which is soldered to a
 mirror mount clip, and a transistor heatsink with small fan attached.
 A 10K ohm thermistor is glued against the clip to monitor the temperature
 and the outside of the clip is covered with hot-melt glue to add some
 thermal insulation.  Everything weighs in at only 20 or 30 grams
 and clips on the mirror mount without detectably changing alignment.
 Currently, this rig can only be used on the cathode
 end mirror because it isn't electrically insulated for the high voltage
 present at the anode.  But this is sufficient for dealing with the HR
 mirrors of barcode scanner tubes, which are all anode-end output.  (At
 least the ones I have are.)
<p>
 Applying negative or positive current via a pair of switches (one for
 on/off and the other for polarity) to the TEC allows the mirror's
 temperature to be ramped up and down.  It should be possible to use
 a TEC controller to maintain a constant temperature, though I haven't
 tried this.
<p>
 Here are some specific examples of tubes with major waste beam power
 variation.
<p>
 Siemens LGR-7641 red HeNe laser tubes are apparently made
 without wedge in the HR mirror (at least some of them).  For a red tube
 with its much higher gain and lower OC mirror reflectance, there will be
 virtually no detectable variation in output power due to interference in
 the HR mirror, but waste beam power could still change significantly.
<p>
 <A HREF="si7641m1.gif">Plot of Siemens LGR-7641 HeNe Laser Tube With Waste
 Beam Power Variation During Warmup (Uncorrected)</A> shows the behavior
 of a healthy fully to spec tube.  The tube was enclosed in a thermal
 blanket (a bunch of thin packing foam) so that its temperature increase
 would be higher and similar to that of a cylindrical laser head.  Several
 complete cycles of dramatic power variation is clearly evident.
<p>
 The cause being due to the etalon was confirmed by putting a dab of 5 minute
 Epoxy on the outer surface of the mirror.  The Epoxy is smooth and clear
 enough to pass sufficient power for the photodiodes (though the power is
 lower).  But the Epoxy is lumpy enough to greatly reduce the power variation.
 The glass and Epoxy are fairly closely index matched
 so that the dominant reflection is no longer from the planar glass surface
 but from the lumpy surface of the Epoxy.  So there is minimal reflection
 directly back along the optical axis and thus minimal etalon effect.
 There is still a small amount of variation that doesn't track the
 output power in the main beam but it is greatly reduced.  The residual
 long term fluctuations are at least in part due to the imperfect index
 matching of the glass to the Epoxy.
<p>
 I expected that an optical wedge would virtually elminate it.
 But, adding a Brewster plate from a Melles Griot polarized HeNe
 laser tube glued to the HR at an angle using Norland 63 UV
 cure optical cement to attach it and fill the gap resulted
 in almost no change.  The wedge assembly looks a lot better than
 a glob of Epoxy, but doesn't work any better and may in fact
 be very slightly worse.  Admittedly, the index of refraction of Norland 63
 (n = 1.56) isn't quite the same as that of optical glass (n = 1.50 to
 1.53) so some improvement should still be possible.
<p>
 Running the numbers for a few residual reflectance values using an Excel
 spreadsheet, it can be seen that even a 0.04 percent reflectivity for the
 outer surface of the HR would result in around 8 percent variation in waste
 beam power, similar to what is shown in the two plots of the tube with
 correction:
<p>
<PRE>
   Residual R   Pmax/Pmin
  ------------------------
     10.00%      3.7028

      0.004%     1.0256
      0.001%     1.0127
</PRE>
<p>
 The Fresnel equation for normal incidence reflection for
 materials with index of refraction n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> is:
<p>
<PRE>
           n<sub>1</sub>-n<sub>2</sub>
     R = (-------)<sup>2</sup>
           n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>
</PRE>
<p>
 Plugging in n<sub>1</sub>=1.50 and n<sub>2</sub>=1.56, the result is
 just about 0.04 percent.  How about that. :)  So, going to Norland 65
 with n=1.52 could reduce the reflection by about a factor of 8
 and the ripples by a factor of 4.  Stay tuned.
<p>
 Finally, the results of re-glueing the
 angled plate with Norland 65 (n = 1.524) are shown in
 <A HREF="si7641m2.gif">Plot of Siemens LGR-7641 HeNe Laser Tube
 With Waste Beam Power Variation During Warmup (Corrected)</A>.
 For this plot, the tube was enclosed in an insulating blanket so the
 final temperature went much higher and there are more ripples.  They
 may be a reduced in amplitude but there is
 no dramatic decrease.  However, observe the phase relationship of the
 waste beam ripples to the main beam ripples: They are in phase.  This
 suggests that the cause of the residual power variation at this point
 may actually be an etalon effect from the OC AR coating rather than
 lack of wedge in the HR.  More on this below.  Also, the number of cycles
 has increased which would be consistent with an OC mirror problem if its
 temperature rise was greater.  They would have been present in the previous
 run, but drowned out by the HR-induced ripples.  Both runs were made
 under identical conditions and the number of mode cycles is about
 the same, so the overall temperature increase of the tube is about the
 same.  But the temperature increases of the HR and OC mirrors can differ
 significantly.
<p>
 Another tube with a similar malady (at least from our point of view) is
 shown in <A HREF="up098m1.gif">Plot of Uniphase 098 HeNe Laser Tube
 With Waste Beam Power Variation During Warmup (Bare, Uncorrected)</A>.
<p>
 To further confirm this explanation, I installed the 098 tube
 in a cylinder to thermally insulate it.
 With the bare tube and the low operating current (3.5 mA),
 the HR mirror really doesn't get that warm and the tube is very
 near thermal equilibrium at the end of the plot, above.  Installing the
 tube in a semi-insulated enclosure permits the HR mirror
 (and the entire tube) to increase in temperature by a much
 greater amount.  Now, <A HREF="up098m2.gif">Plot of Uniphase
 098 HeNe Laser Tube With Waste Beam Power Variation During
 Warmup (Insulated, Uncorrected)</A> shows nearly four complete cycles of
 waste beam amplitude variation over the course of more than
 1.5 hours.  A close examination of the Total Power (Output)
 shows small dips representing the power being stolen by the waste
 beam from main beam!  The measured output power is about 1 mW.  The
 amplitude of the waste beam power variation for this tube is from about
 5 uW to 10 uW.
<p>
 Indeed, many 6 inch barcode scanner tubes have variable waste
 beam power.  Two classic cases are shown in <A HREF="lhr006m1.gif">Plot of
 Melles Griot 05-LHR-006 HeNe Laser Tube #1 With Waste Beam Power Variation
 During Warmup (Insulated, Uncorrected)</A> and
 <A HREF="lhr006m2.gif">Plot of Melles Griot
 05-LHR-006 HeNe Laser Tube #2 With Waste Beam Power Variation During
 Warmup (Insulated, Uncorrected)</A>.  These are bad but neither
 has the theoretical maximum waste beam power variation ratio of about 2.25:1.
 The cause of the differences is not known as they all had their HR mirror
 carefully cleaned and were run under identical conditions.  Perhaps the
 HR mirrors of #2 and #3 had a very very slight amount of wedge after all,
 accidentally introduced during manufacture.  They are the identical model
 number.  And note the scale change for the waste beam power
 on the left of the plots between #2 and #3.  The output power differs slightly
 as well, but in the opposite direction!  When snugly enclosed in a head
 cylinder, they go through 5 to 6 full power variation cycles in a shorter
 time than for the 098.  This is partially due to there being a similar power
 dissipation but in a smaller volume, so the equilibrium temperature can
 go higher.  For the worst case, #1, the peak waste beam power is almost
 60 uW and it varies by 30 uW.  But for all three, the "stolen" power is
 clearly visible as ripples in the output.
<p>
 Some other very similar Melles Griot 6 inch tubes have wedged HRs
 and are relatively well behaved as shown in
 <A HREF="lhr006m3.gif">Plot of Melles Griot 05-LHR-006 HeNe Laser Tube With
 Minimal Waste Beam Power Variation During Warmup (Insulated,
 Uncorrected)</A>.  It's apparently a coin toss even for tubes with
 identical part numbers.  For example, the two Melles Griot 05-LHR-006
 tubes with no wedge had actual part numbers of 50-03400-014B and I have
 at least 2 others like that.  The one with wedge above was 05-LHR-006-360.
 But I have since found several 50-03400-014Bs as well as several
 50-03400-014 with varying amounts of wedge.  A genuine 05-LHR-006 (no
 suffix) also has a bit of wedge.
<p>
 Uniphase model 1007 tubes come in both flavors as well.  One
 sample behaved even better than the 05-LHR-006 as shown in
 <A HREF="up1007m1.gif">Plot of
 Uniphase 1007 HeNe Laser Tube With Minimal Waste Beam Power Variation
 During Warmup (Insulated, Uncorrected)</A>.  But another identical model
 tube from the same model barcode scanner had among the worst case of this
 problem as shown in <A HREF="up1007m2.gif">Plot of Uniphase 1007 HeNe Laser
 Tube With Large Waste Beam Power Variation During Warmup (Insulated,
 Uncorrected)</A>.  The amplitude of its waste beam power variation is
 close to that theoretical maximum of 2.25:1.  Both these tubes has
 part numbers of 1007-726.
<p>
 Some Siemens 6 inch tubes like the LGR-7659 may have no wedge.
<p>
 And tube used interchangeably with the LGR-7641 and 098 may be almost
 totally free of any waste beam variabiilty as shown in
 <A HREF="sp088m1.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 HeNe Laser
 Tube During Warmup</A>.  (For this plot, only total power from
 the main beam is shown.)
<p>
 However, the residual waste beam power variation for tubes with even a small
 amount of wedge is  likely due to some other cause, specifically, similar
 reflection problems with the OC mirror.  More on this below.  It should take
 very little wedge to totally eliminate the power variations.
<p>
 Awhile later, I acquired several Zygo HeNe laser tubes used in  one of
 their stabilized HeNe lasers, possibly the 7702.  Two of the three
 tubes had a thin coating of clear silicone on the surface of the HR
 mirror in front of the polarization beam sampler assembly.  When the
 silicone was removed, it was found that the HR had no wedge.
 The third tube lacked the silicone and had wedge.  So, this stunt has
 been used to correct at least one commercial "oops". :)
<p>
<li><b>OC mirror:</b>
 The OC mirror outer surface is generally AR coated so its reflection is
 much less than the 4 percent of uncoated glass of the HR mirror.
 A residual reflectivity of somewhere between 0.1  and 0.5 percent is
 typical.  Since the OC mirror is generally curved and its outer surface
 may also be curved, the alignment of the front and back is not guaranteed
 even if there is no wedge, as this will depend on the centering of the
 mirror with respect to the tube bore, and the actual mirror alignment.
 In addition, the finesse of the etalon that is formed with curved surfaces
 will be lower.  But there can still be problems unless the OC mirror
 substrate is also ground with wedge, as is often the case with higher
 quality lasers.
<p>
 Assuming planar surfaces (since that's all I can deal with!), the variation
 in effective reflectivity will vary from perhaps 10 to 30 percent (compared
 to up to 125 percent for the HR).  However, the effects of this variation
 will be more subtle.  Why?  Ignoring losses, a modest change in OC
 reflectivity will change the intracavity power almost in proportion
 to the change in reflectivity, so that the output power will change
 only slightly.  But the waste beam power will vary in direct proportion
 to the effective reflectivity change.  The calculations for the
 transmission function and number of cycles with temperature are
 similar to that for the HR mirror except that the reflection
 from the OC mirror's outer surface is much smaller and thus the
 variation in waste beam power is smaller.  The variation in main beam
 power will be very small.
<p>
 I initially somewhat confirmed this effect on the 05-LHR-006 tube with HR
 wedge (and therefore supposedly without HR etalon problems)
 by alternately heating and cooling only the OC mirror with a blow
 dryer and damp cotton swab.  The waste beam power could be made to change
 noticeably while the output power remained nearly constant.  If what was
 actually changing was mirror alignment, the output power should also
 have gone up and down, but it did not.
 And when I added a blob of 5 minute Epoxy to the
 HR mirror of the same 05-LHR-006 tube, there was essentially
 no change in the amplitude of the ripples.  Had it been reflections from
 the wedged surface, they should have gotten smaller.  So the culprit is
 almost certainly a similar lack of wedge for the OC mirror.  Adding
 a blob of Epoxy to the OC mirror actually made the ripples larger.  Then
 to be sure I added an angled plate to the OC using Norland 65 UV cure
 adhesive which should have matched the index of the glass quite closely.
 But with the AR coating stuck in between, there is a discontinuity and
 the result is shown in <A HREF="lhr006m5.gif">Plot of Melles Griot
 05-LHR-006 HeNe Laser Tube With Moderate Waste Beam Power Variation
 During Warmup Due to Messed Up OC AR Coating (Insulated, Uncorrected)</A>.
 This is essentially identical to the result with Epoxy.  That the variation
 would get worse is expected since it's not possible to index
 match to an AR-coated surface without removing the AR coating.  So, the
 reflection there would increase.  But note the relationship of the waste
 beam ripples to main beam ripples: They are now in phase, just the opposite
 of what happens with HR wedge problems!  This suggests that the reflectivity
 of the OC mirror on this 05-LHR-006 is below that for optimum performance
 since when the effective reflectivity of the OC is maximum (at the peaks of
 the waste beam plot), the output power is also a maximum.  Interesting. :)
 To confirm that the increased ripple amplitude was solely due to the
 increased reflection, I did another run after removing the angled plate
 and cleaning the OC mirror.  The result was identical to that with the
 unmodified tube.
</ul>
<p>
So, here are some tests to determine the source of the ripples:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ghost beams:</b> Check the waste and main beams for faint ghost beams
 at a few degrees off to the side.  Mirror with ghost beams either have wedge
 (intentional or inadvertent), or have the effect of wedge due to alignment.
 With any hint of ghost beam, the mirror in question should not have problems.
 It doesn't take much of a wedge angle to greatly reduce or kill the etalon
 effect.
<p>
<li><b>Amplitude of waste beam power variations:</b> Anything more than about
 10 percent for a tube with an intact clean OC AR coating is due to a problem
 with the HR mirror.  Below 10 percent is likely due to the OC mirror.
<p>
<li><b>Number of ripples:</b> For a specific glass thickness and the same
 temperature change, the number of power variation cycles should be similar.
 Put a heatsink on the mirror mount or have a small fan blowing across it
 or provide some other means of affecting the temperature to determine
 if the number of cycles changes.
<p>
<li><b>Index matching:</b> Put a dab of 5 minute Epoxy, optical adhesive,
 index matching fluid, or even corn oil :) on the suspect mirror.  If the
 amplitude of the power variation greatly decreases, that mirror has a
 problem.
<p>
<li><b>Temperature:</b> Touch a damp cotton swab (Q-tip) to the side of the
 mirror glass.  If the power of the waste beam changes significantly (up or
 down) but the power of the main beam changes at most only very slightly,
 that mirror likely has a problem.
<p>
<li><b>Phase of waste to main beam power variations:</b> Where the reflectivity
 of the HR is much higher than that of the OC as is the case for most
 properly designed and manufactured lasers, the ripples will always be
 out of phase if the problem is with the HR.  They can go either way if
 the problem is with the OC, or the main beam ripples can even be "rectified",
 depending on where the resonator loss is with respect to the optimum.
 Where the reflectivities are similar, problems with either will result in
 an out of phase relationship of waste beam to main beam ripples.
</ul>
<p>
Of course, looking for ghost beams or the "dab of Epoxy" (or index matching
fluid) test will be conclusive.  And, it's always possible that there are
problems at both ends of the laser!
<p>
The only conclusion here can be that while it's easy to reduce the power
variation due to a non-wedged HR significantly (even a smudge or fingerprint
on the glass will do a fair job!), built-in wedge with absolutely no parallel
surfaces to reflect directly back into the tube is really essential for both
the HR and OC mirrors to achieve perfection.
Index matching cement will still leave some reflection at the boundary
and even 0.01 percent - which would be very good - will still result in
a 4 percent variation in output power!  That such a low reflectivity
can produce this much of an effect is quite counter-intuitive. :)
There is no easy solution for the OC mirror at all.
<p>
One possibility that will work for both mirrors is regulated temperature
control of the mirror itself.  This is used in some Laboratory for Science
stabilized HeNe lasers which include active circuitry in a little widget
clamped to the OC mirror to maintain its temperature such that the etalon
transmission is maximum.  But simply temperature controlling the tube
isn't adequate since even if locked to a particular mode, there is no
guarantee that the mirrors themselves will be maintained at a constant
temperature.
<p>
The variation in output power for either HR or OC etalon effects is small
and might go unnoticed for most applications.  The variation in waste beam
power, though typically a much greater percentage of the average waste beam
power, is even more likely to go unnoticed since it's, well, usually wasted.
Whatever waste beam peculiarities may be present with one sample
of any model tube doesn't necessarily mean they all will behave similarly
since what happens at the back of the tube or even the slight output beam
ripples would not impact the laser's important specifications.
<p>
But where the waste beam is used for something like implementing a
stabilized HeNe laser, a laser tube without this malady should be selected
if possible.  Adding an external wedged optic to the HR is also a possibility
but unless the index matching of the glue is essentially perfect, there will
always be some residual reflection and even 0.001 percent will still result in
more than a 1 percent in waste beam power variation.
<p>
For a particularly interesting case study where this did matter, see the

With Variable Output</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrsstl">HeNe Tube Use and Life Expectancy</A></h3>

You often hear that lasers like to be run to keep them healthy and maximize
life.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Soft-seal HeNe laser tubes (older ones and some large-frame HeNe lasers
 with Brewster window tubes) are supposed to benefit from being run frequently
 in terms of extending tube life or just keeping them alive.  Although this is
 the party line - and is true of some ion lasers (but for reasons unrelated to
 the type of seals), to what extent it applies to soft-seal HeNe lasers seems
 to vary based on type of sealant and other unknown factors.
<p>
 The only simple explanation that makes sense for this need to run soft-seal
 tubes periodically is the cleanup mechanism: Running a HeNe tube with slight
 contamination (through the soft-seals) for an extended period of time
 (several hours or several days) may clean it up as the cathode acts as a very
 slow getter and removes the unwanted gas molecules.  It has been suggested
 that allowing the tube run from a cold start only until the output power
 peaks and then starts to decline (assuming it bahaves this way) may be better
 than operating continuously, and power cycling in general seems to speed
 up the revival process (minutes or hours, not seconds).  However, once the
 tube is too far gone (having been left in storage unpowered, for example) it
 won't even start.  Thus, this sort of cleanup cannot take place.  Or if it
 does start, the weak getter effect will be insufficient to provide any
 benefit.  Then, the only hope is activating the actual getter electrode (if
 present) by some other means.
<p>
 I had several dozen ancient soft-seal HeNe barcode scanner tubes, the
 majority of which have survived just fine lying dormant for an unknown, but
 substantial number of years - probably 20 or more.  Most of the remainder
 were too far gone to be useful for anything but salvaging the mirrors.  (See
 the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt6">An Older HeNe Laser Tube</A>.)
<p>
 I do know that my SP-130B, probably dating from the mid-1960s, continues
 to lase at about the same power level as when I got it a few years ago.
 I try to run it for a few seconds daily.  Unfortunately, I don't have a
 similar laser that isn't being run daily so this isn't really conclusive.
<p>
<li>Most hard-seal HeNe tubes do not degrade significantly from sitting idle -
 at least, not on a time scale that matters.  The only effect that might
 be seen after a long period is an increase in the starting voltage - the
 tube becomes harder to start.  (Where a hard-seal tube starts to lose power
 in conjunction with a change in discharge color, it is almost certainly due
 to a leak - a cracked/defective frit seal or exhaust tube.  See the sections
 starting with: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr">Repairing Leaky or Broken HeNe
 Tubes</A>.)  Thus, there is usually no need to run modern hard-sealed HeNe
 tubes periodically.  They can be powered up as needed for the particular
 application.  While starting may cause some wear and tear (how much
 depends on the type of power supply), a reasonable number of starting
 cycles (not once a second for five years!) should have a minimal impact
 on tube life.
<p>
 However, low gain "other color" (e.g., yellow or green) HeNe tubes - even if
 hard-sealed - may show some loss of power from years of non-use.  Since
 gas purity is so critical with these, even very slight internal contamination
 or diffusion of unwanted gas molecules through the glass may dramatically
 impact performance.  As with soft-seal tubes, running them for a few hours
 or days may help restore power.
</ul>
<p>
For both types of HeNe tubes (as well as other lasers), power and beam quality
will peak only after some warmup period.  So it makes sense to keep the laser
energized continuously over the course of an application where these are
critical but this has no bearing on any need to turn the laser on just to keep
it healthy.
<p>
Here is a chart of <i>very rough</i> guidelines for evaluating HeNe lasers.
This is based solely on my observations with only minimal input from those
who should know about this sort of stuff like major laser companies:
<p>
<PRE>
 Characteristic            New      Middle Age    High Mileage    End-of-Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------=----------

 Brown crud in bore (6)    None        Some           Much            Much
</PRE>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Most tubes will start easily, at well below the spec'd maximum starting
 voltage.  However, there are exceptions, which hopefully end up in the
 dumspter, or more likely, the surplus market. :)  Starting <i>may</i>
 become more difficult as the tube is used, though not always.  But, at
 end-of-life, it could be almost impossible.

<li>When new, the tube operating voltage will be close to the spec'd value.
 As the tube is run, it will increase gradually until end-of-life where
 it may become dramatically higher.
<p>
<li>Dropout current on a new tube should be well below the operating current
 but will gradually increase with use until it may reach the operating
 current.  Then, the tube will start but not remain on, flashing
 or flickering.  Increasing the ballast resistance with a good portion of
 it very close to the tube anode may reduce the dropout current substantially
 on a healthy tube, but will have little effect on a high mileage one.  For
 example, the following data were measured for a healthy Zygo 2 mW tube:
<p>
<PRE>
     Ballast     Dropout
    Resistance   Current
  ------------------------
       68K       4.75 mA
       80K       4.5  mA
       90K       4.25 mA
      107K       3.75 mA
      134K       3.25 mA
      161K       3.0  mA
      188K       2.75 mA
</PRE>
<p>
 For this tube, adding about 36K ohms very close to the anode enabled the
 laser to be stable at the fixed power supply current of 4.5 mA allowing it
 to be retrofitted into a Spectra-Physics laser head.  With
 the original 75K ohm ballast, this was marginal and the discharge became
 unstable after warmup.  Of course, the operating voltage increased by
 about 160 V, so the power supply needed to be capable of dealing with that.
<p>
<li>Output power on average may actually increase during the early stages of
 the tube's life due to initial overfill, but will then decrease gradually
 until end-of-life, where it will nose dive.  Output power may also change
 as a result of slight mirror misalignment caused by multiple thermal cycles
 but this is fully correctable.
<p>
<li>With use, the gas pressure inside the tube decreases resulting in a trend
 toward becoming more pink.  But at end-of-life, sputtering results in
 a tendency to become more white or purple.  By then, output power may
 have droped by 95 percent, if there is any output at all.
<p>
<li>Brown crud develops with use, though not all tubes will have any.  Where
 present, in many cases there will be very distinct striations in the brown
 crud, indicating plasma oscillations, but this appearance alone may not imply
 much of anything about the tube's health.
</ol>
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmg640">Case Study of 145 Melles
Griot 05-LHR-640 HeNe Laser Tubes</A> for an example of the behavior of
one specific model.  I do not know to what extent these data apply to
other HeNe lasers.

<h3><A NAME="htrhltg">HeNe Laser Tube Gas Pressure and End-Of-Life</A></h3>

The most significant mechanism is causing aging in a HeNe laser tube run
under normal operating conditions (rated current, reasonable number of
starting cycles), is cathode sputtering which traps gas molecules under/in
the metal film and gradually reduces the gas pressure inside the tube.
Since sputtering is more severe at low pressure, beyond a certain point,
this process accelerates leading to a rapid deterioiration in performance
near end-of-life.  The "pickling" of the aluminum cathode surface to
reduce its work function can only do so much.
<p>
In addition to the discharge color becoming less intense and pinker,
the increase in operating voltage, and eventually, the decline in
output power, at least three other measurable values can be indicators
of low pressure:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Output power versus tube current:</b> At the normal pressure at which
 most HeNe laser tubes are filled, the output power peaks at the nominal
 operating current, and then declines with increasing current.  However,
 as gas pressure decreases, the current at which the peak occurs will
 increase, and eventually output power will simply increase with increasing
 tube current.
<p>
 However, there are some strange situations where mirror alignment can
 <i>appear</i> to affect the nominal operating current.  And, wide bore
 multimode HeNe lasers may have a recommended operating current which
 is below the current for maximum power to extend tube life.
<p>
<li><b>Dropout current:</b> This is the lowest current where the discharge
 will be stable, regardless of the ballast resistance and wiring/tube
 capacitance.  For new red (632.8 nm) HeNe tubes, it's usually lower than
 75 percent of the nominal current, with some down below 50 percent.
 However, as the gas pressure decreases, the dropout current goes up.
 When it reaches the nominal operating current, the tube may be unusable
 even if the output power is still decent.  Increasing the operating current
 may extend the life somewhat but it's probably time to look for a
 replacement tube.  (Of course, a high dropout current could also be
 due to power supply, ballast, or wiring problems, so check for those
 first!)  On a healthy tube, adding ballast resistance (25K or 50K ohms)
 very close to the tube anode may reduce the dropout current enough to
 make the laser usable, but this will also increase the operating current
 required of the power supply.
<p>
<li><b>Spectral line ratio:</b> The ratio of the intensities of two emission
 lines in the discharge spectra can be used as an indicator of the tube
 gas pressure, more or less independent of the He:Ne fill ratio.
 When the ratio of 501.6 nm to 587.6 nm (both He lines) exceeds about
 0.5, the pressure is declining below the range where most new to mid-life
 laser tubes are operating.  By also measuring the Ne line at 585.3 nm,
 it should be possible to tell even more about the laser tube's health.
 Of course, even if you can find these lines with a diffraction grating,
 a monochronometer and sensitive amplifier will be needed to make the
 measurements.  (See the section:
 <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liamono">Monochromators</A>)
</ol>
<p>
For more on evaluation of HeNe lasers using these techniques, see <A HREF=
"http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/232/ibmrd2302D.pdf">Nondestructive
Analysis for HeNe Lasers (IBM Research Report)</A>.  This 1979 paper
includes several graphs showing the relationship of these quantities to
gas pressure.
<p>
Note that since green, yellow, and some "other color" HeNe laser tubes are
filled at reduced pressure to achieve maximum gain, their life expectancy is
generally lower than for red ones, and the measurable quantities will be
correspondingly modified.  It will be interesting to look at their spectral
lines as well.

</PRE>
<p>
<ul>
<li>ID#s 1 and 2 are a healthy Melles Griot (MG) short barcode scanner HeNe
 laser tube and a sick PMS tunable laser.  I'm not sure what this means since
 the numbers are almost identical for the first two lasers even though the
 MG is a perfectly healthy lively barcode scanner tube but the PMS has a
 noticeably less bright discharge and almost no gain.  H<sub>2</sub>
 contamination was originally suspected for (2) but none was detected
 at the normal gain setting of my monochromator/detector.
<p>
<li>The AO 3100 (ID# 2) is a very old laser from the late 1960s or
 early 1970s which is weak and getting weaker as it runs.  (The life
 expectancy of these early lasers was typically only around 100 hours anyhow
 and I've used up at least 10 percent of that just in testing!)
 It clearly has dramatically different measurements.  But since it has a
 wider bore with a heated filament-cathode, separate cathode and
 anode side-arms, and likely filled at a much lower pressure, the significance,
 if any, of these off-the-chart values is unclear.  Further
 study will be required. :)
<p>
<li>The Aerotech LS4P (ID# 4) is also a very old tube (1970s) and weak (1.7 mW,
 should be 4 mW) but of a modern design.  However, it has been growing
 stronger with running time, though I don't think much more improvement
 is likely.  Its discharge color now appears normal but had been a sickly
 pink hue at first.  More on this tube can be found in the section:
<p>
<li>The Aerotech LFT250-55 (ID# 5) is an old high power tube with
 a side-arm cathode.  It started out with a weak pink discharge.  After
 running for several days, it now has a somewhat better complexion but the
 discharge color is still more pink and less intense than a healthy tube.
 It should output over 20 mW but continues to produce exactly 0 mW.
 The cause is almost certainly residual hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the
 tube.  Spectral analysis (using a Verity monochromator/detector) shows
 strong emission at the most intense hydrogen lines:
<p>
 <PRE>
         NIST Database       Measured
     Wavelength  Intensity   Intensity
   -------------------------------------
      410.2 nm (H2)  30          20
      434.0 nm (H2)  60          60
      486.1 nm (H2) 160         250
      656.3 nm (H2) 300        1000

      501.6 nm (He)  -          137
      585.3 nm (Ne)  -          217
      587.6 nm (He)  -          325
 </PRE>
<p>
 The intensity numbers are just relative to each other and I'm not sure they
 really have much significance since many factors influence the wavelength
 balance.  But, the dominant line in the spectrum by far is that of
 H<sub>2</sub> at 656.3 nm and the other H<sub>2</sub> lines shouldn't
 be there either!
<p>
 H<sub>2</sub> probably comes originally from water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O)
 contamination.  The H<sub>2</sub>O is dissociated by the discharge resulting
 in free hydrogen and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).  There is no evidence of the
 presense of any residual O<sub>2</sub>, though there may have been some
 originally (before running the tube for several days).   No nitrogen, argon,
 or krypton have been detected either.  Apparently, the gettering process
 is very poor at removing hydrogen.
<p>
 To be sure, as noted above, I also determined that He and Ne don't
 have lines very close to any of these H<sub>2</sub> wavelengths to confuse the
 measurements.  As further proof, I looked for spectral lines at these
 hydrogen wavelengths in the healthy barcode scanner tube (ID# 1) and
 found none.
<p>
 Also of interest is that despite the large H<sub>2</sub> contamination, the
 relative intensities of the He and Ne lines are similar to that of the
 healthy tube Melles Griot tube.
<p>
<li>Later, I did a complete spectral scan of ID# 2, the first PMS LSTP-1010.
 I had originally suspected H<sub>2</sub> contamination for this tube, but
 there was essentially nothing detectable at 656 nm at my normal
 monochromator/detector gain setting.  (In retrospect I probably
 should have turned up the gain and
 double checked.)  As noted above, the ratios of He:Ne are nearly
 identical to that of the very healthy Melles Griot tube.  The discharge
 color looks relatively normal, though slightly weak.  No other contaminating
 lines were detected.  However, a similar PMS/REO tube did recover after
 running for 100 to 200 hours so it's possible there is low level H2
 contamination and that got cleaned up.  I will be running the LSTP-1010
 to see if that can be cured.
<p>
<li>ID# 6 is a PMS-style tube from an Ohmeda Raman anasthesia gas analyzer.
 (See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henorga">The Ohmeda Raman Gas
 Analyzer PMS One-Brewster Laser</A>.)
 While it didn't have any obvious contamination based on a spectral scan,
 the original discharge was somewhat pink.  However, running this tube for
 between 100 and 200 hours resulted in what appears to be complete recovery.
 So, it may have had H<sub>2</sub> or other gas contaminaion.
<p>
<li>I also did a complete spectral scan of ID# 7, another PMS LSTP-1010, which
 has a broken bore and has not been run in an unknown number of years.  The
 ratios for He and Ne differ slightly from the other PMS tubes, but this one
 shows significant H<sub>2</sub> contamination.  It would be an interesting
 experiment to run this tube for an extended period of time simply to see if
 the H<sub>2</sub> contamination will get cleaned up when it is originally
 so large.  But from past experience, any H2 contamination sufficient
 to interfere with lasing won't clean up within the lifetime of the
 Universe.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrbrwn">Brown Deposits Inside HeNe Tube Bore</A></h3>

Many surplus HeNe laser tubes - both hard-seal and soft-seal - will have
various amounts of a brown material coating portions of the inside of the
bore, usually toward the anode-end.  The presence of these unsightly
deposits has no significant impact on operation or power output directly,
but is an indication that the tube has seen a lot of use.
And, on average, tubes with a lot of brown crud may be harder
to start and require higher voltage to run - but that's more related to
the high mileage than the preseance of brown crud in the bore.
On high power lasers with IR suppression magnets, the brown stuff will
generally collect near the magnets with obvious effects of N and S polarity.
I've yet to see an explanation for this phenomenon in any laser reference.
One suggestion from someone from a major HeNe laser manufacturer was that
it was material sputtered off the anode but the one below makes more sense.
<p>
(From: Chris Leubner (cdleubner@ameritech.net).)
<p>
The usual cause is silicon being freed from the oxygen in the glass
due to the intensely hot plasma on it. The ionized oxygen ends up reacting
with the getter or cathode leaving elemental silicon film behind causing
that brown look. In some tubes it will make a zebra or tiger stripe pattern
on the bore that is a dead giveaway of both long use and plasma oscillation.
On larger tubes that use magnets for IR suppression (Zeeman splitting), the
magnetic fields smash the plasma into the tube wall and increases the rate
of dissociation of the glass. The oxygen, which is a gas, will disperse
throughout the tube and combine with the more reactive materials in it,
namely the getter or cathode. The silicon will remain behind wherever it was
separated because it is not volatile and relatively difficult to ionize.
I do not know why it appears first on the anode end. My guess is probably
due to the larger number of negative ions there reacting with the silica
in the glass via this reaction:
SiO<sub>2</sub>+2Ne-1=SiO+O-2+2Ne.  Then SiO+2Ne-1=Si+O-2+2Ne.

<h3><A NAME="htrcssh">Care of HeNe Laser Tubes</A></h3>

The often quoted party line is that soft-seal HeNe lasers should be run
periodically to maintain their health and that this is not necessary for
hard-seal tubes.  The true story is a bit more complex.
<p>
All modern internal mirror HeNe laser tubes use hard-seal construction where
everything but the mirrors (where the required high temperatures would
destroy the coatings) use glass-to-metal seals.  Mirrors are either sealed
with frit (low temperature glass powder which acts as a sort of solder for
glass), optical contacting, or are fully enclosed inside the glass envelope.
None of these seals leak on any time scale that matters unless the processing
was defective.  Melles Griot quotes a 12 year shelf life but in reality, it's
virtually unlimited.
<p>
Note that frit is quite soft compared to even optical glass so don't
unnecessarily abuse the mirror seals.  Those with large amounts of frit
like Melles Griot and Siemens are fairly robust.  But the mirrors on
those with only a thin frit line like Aerotech and Uniphase may pop
off if whacked the wrong way.  Unless your intent was to salvage the
mirrors, this would be bad news.  However, even those robust Melles Griot
globs of frit can be cracked (which is just as bad) by a metal tool like
a pipe used in an attempt to adjust mirror alignment.
<p>
However, there are still many external mirror HeNe lasers that use soft-seals
for the Brewster window(s) and these show up surplus with varying degrees of
leakage.  Tubes of the same age may differ greatly in their condition,
apparently due to large variations in the rate of leakage.  Where the discharge
color is still a pastel but quite bright - somewhat more pink than normal,
even with a bluish tinge - just running the tube for a few hours or days may
clean it up irrespective of the condition of the getter because the cathode
itself acts as a getter - a very slow one but good enough to scavenge a small
amount of contamination.  The typical discharge color that is still salvageable
would be the "Minor" examples in <A HREF="henedcol.gif">Color of HeNe Laser
Tube Discharge and Gas Fill</A>, perhaps slightly worse.  Even a HeNe tube that
doesn't lase at all may benefit from this simple treatment.  Periodically
running soft-sealed HeNe laser tubes without getters or with exhausted
getters is recommended.  A few hours every month is probably adequate and
this will extend their life considerably, possibly indefinitely.  This is
much preferred compared to restoring power once it's gone.  Note that
<i>any</i> detectable (by eye) change in discharge color will be accompanied
by a significant drop in output power.  As the tube is operated, the discharge
color will gradually approach the correct one.  The last place where a normal
color appears will be the expanded regions of tubing (e.g., in the glass tube
that joins the side-mounted cathode to the bore in a Spectra-Physics laser).
Here, the normal color is a nice orange but will tend toward pink or
pinkish-blue with contamination.
<p>
Remarkably, for a soft-seal tube, the bottom of the "Minor" samples may
actually be easier to salvage by running for a few hours.  I've revived
both a very old SP-130B as well as a not quite so old SP-120 using this
simple treatment.  Both these lasers were discarded because based on the
color of the discharge, the original owners thought they were too far gone
for there to be any hope.  The SP-130B only recovered to about one third its
rated power (but it is over 30 years old!).  Running it every few days for a
couple minutes appears as though it will maintain that power indefinitely.
(I actually run it for less than a minute daily.)  The SP-120 was restored
to essentially new specifications, as was a PMS tube from a Raman gas
analyzer.  (See the various case studies in the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhos">Reports from Sam's HeNe Laser Hospital</A>.)
<p>
However, if the discharge color is highly saturated red or blue (the bottom two
examples in the above diagram) and/or there are visible striations of the
discharge in the expanded regions of tubing, all hope is probably lost as no
amount of operation or getter reactivation will make enough difference to
matter.  But there is nothing to lose by running the tube for awhile to see
if a miracle occurs. :)
<p>
When powering a HeNe tube with an off-color discharge, keep in mind that the
operating voltage may be quite different than normal especially initially
and may overstress the power supply if it doesn't have enough compliance.
A brute force unregulated power supply on a Variac can also be used, adjusting
the Variac to maintain a more or less constant current at the rated value for
the tube.  It's also nice to monitor the laser's output (assuming there is
any eventually!) with a laser power meter to keep track of how the patient
is responding to treatment. What may happen is that the power will initially
increase, then decrease as the tube heats up and internal parts outgas,
then gradually decrease again as the cathode acting as a getter scavenges
the contaminants, and then level off.  This process may take several hours
or days.  Powering the laser on successive occasions may result in increasing
power levels if the process wasn't complete and this seems to work better
in general than simply running the laser continuously.  One theory is that
the power declines because parts of the tube become hot enough for previously
trapped gases to go back into circulation.  In some cases, this results in
a permanent *decrease* is power which is not recoverable.  In other words,
your mileage may vary.
<p>
Hard-seal red (632.8 nm) HeNe tubes generally will not respond to these sorts
treatments since there should be essentially no leakage over any time scale
that matters.  The gain - as modest as it may be - is suffient that any
improvement may be detectable only by careful power measurements
before and after.  But there can be exceptions.  I did have a
modern Melles Griot internal mirror HeNe tube that had an off-color discharge
and low power.  Running it for several hours didn't help at all but activating
the getter with my Solar furnace rig completely cured it permanently (it's been
over two years now with no degradation in discharge color or output power so
this tube isn't a "leaker" but must have not have been properly processed at
the factory).  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrnlt">Repairing the
Northern Lights Tube</A>.
<p>
However, for "other color" HeNe lasers, particularly yellow and green ones
which have very low gain (about 1/20th of red), running even a hard-seal
tube for a few hours *before* thinking about touching mirror alignment can
make the difference between nothing and something, even if that something
is small.
<p>
I've found some hard-seal HeNe laser tubes where the gas fill was obviously
contaminated on the shelf.  One example was the HeNe laser tube from a
Hewlett Packard 5501A two-frequency (Zeeman split) laser head that
hadn't been used in about 15 years.  It wouldn't lase at all when
first powered up.  After running for a total of about 12 hours,
it has recovered probably to essentially normal output.  This
type tube is of very high quality construction and no doubt
was very expensive with glass-to-metal seals for electrical
connections and mirrors fully enclosed inside the glass envelope.
Leakage is unlikely so it must have been internal outgassing
over time.  Thus, even hard-seal tubes can suffer from soft-seal
maladies! :)  After being idle for about 2 years, the power had again
declined, but only to about 25 percent of the recovered level.  Running
for awhile again restored it, with a rapid recovery to about the
50 percent level in a minute or so and back to 100 percent in
a few hours.
<p>
Note that end-of-life tubes will often show an off-color discharge which may
be mistaken for leakage.  Output power will be low or zero and there will
often be evidence of shiny metallic sputtering deposits on the glass near
the cathode can - a dead giveaway that the tube is end-of-life.  They will
also likely be hard to start with a very high operating voltage.  On Melles
Griot tubes, there will be shiny metallic deposits on the glass opposite the
three or four holes at the rear end of the cathode can.  On Hughes-style tubes,
it will be on the glass at the cathode end of the tube.  These tubes will
not respond to any known treament.

<h3><A NAME="htrtipo">Tip-Off Comments</A></h3>

The following ONLY applies to metal exhaust tubes; those made of glass
have obvious issues of their own but if there's any problem with them,
it's generally obvious!
<p>
The metal exhaust pipe that was used to evacuate and back-fill the tube
on most HeNe and small ion lasers, colloquially called
the "tip-off" or "pinch-off", is sealed by a special very expensive tool
that squeezes the pipe shut with incredible force and then severs it
entirely.  The objective is to cause the metal to cold-weld and thus be
vacuum-tight.  This is not like a metal compression fitting in plumbing
where the connection doesn't leak simply due to cold flow of the metal and
a tight fit; the two sides of the exhaust pipe metal actually become one.
<p>
Usually, it takes a deliberate effort to actually get the tip-off to leak,
requiring filing or cutting with a hacksaw or bending over with a BIG wrench.
Doing the latter is more likely to crack the glass-to-metal seal rather than
affecting the integrity of the tip-off.  Squeezing the exhaust tube with a
pair of pliers to open it up probably won't work either.  In rare cases,
where some speck of something got in between the two halves of the tube
while being sealed, there might be a slow leak or a weak spot subject to
failure with minimal abuse, but this is somewhat unusual.
<p>
On most Melles Griot HeNe laser tubes, there is a glob of Epoxy or
something similar covering the end of the tip-off.  It's there to prevent
the sharp edge from attacking unsuspecting humans, not so much to protect
the tip-off from damage.  Other manufacturers who care about your flesh
might put a piece of heat shrink tubing or a rubber protector over it.
Still others haven't had enough law suits and don't bother covering it
at all. :)
<p>
However, don't be tempted to file the edges of the tip-off to smooth them.
On some tubes, even a small amount of filing will result in a leak.  Put your
own glob of Epoxy over the end if desired.

<h3><A NAME="htrteml">Troubleshooting an External Mirror HeNe Laser</A></h3>

In addition to all of the problems of internal mirror HeNe tubes, external
mirror lasers are subject to dirty optics and much more prone to have
misaligned mirrors.
<p>
Like their internal mirror counterparts, the general appearance of the output
when non-lasing will be a diffuse blue, blue-green, or purple spot but no red
light.  If there is <b>any</b> evidence of a red beam, something may be
marginal but it is lasing.
<p>
If it won't start, then the tube could be up to air or there could be a power
supply problem.  Try another power supply if available.  Or, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My Tube is Good?</A> for info
on using a low level RF or microwave source to check for ionization.
<p>
Assuming the tube lights up, follow the steps below to narrow down the cause:

<ol>
<li>If possible, check the tube current.  Though unlikely, a discharge current
 much much greater than optimum will result in low or no output beam (as well
 as overheating of the tube, ballast resistor(s), and power supply components.
<p>
<li>Compare the color of the discharge in the narrow bore/capillary with
 <A HREF="henedcol.gif">Color of HeNe Laser Tube Discharge and Gas Fill</A>.
 The comments about output apply to red and maybe orange HeNe tubes; yellow
 and green HeNe tubes will likely produce no output at all unless the gas
 fill is nearly perfect.  The normal appearance is a white-ish red-orange
 generally described as "salmon color" though there can be a fair range
 from more orange to more pink for a good tube depending on the exact gas
 fill He:Ne ratio and pressure.  Lower pressure tends toward pink and may
 be normal for low gain non-red HeNe tubes to boost gain at the expense of
 tube life.  Some of these may also be even more of a white-ish shade.
 To confirm, check the discharge spectrum, preferably with a
 spectroscope but a diffraction grating or prism may be adequate.  It should
 be similar to the combination of the helium and neon spectra in
 <A HREF="spechene.gif">Bright Line Spectra of Helium and Neon</A>.  If the
 color inside the bore appears normal, check the color of the discharge where
 it isn't as constricted - the color should be quite orange.  (This can be
 seen in the funnel area near the anode on most internal mirror tubes or the
 expanded tubing sections on those like Spectra-Physics side-arm cathode
 tubes with exposed capillaries.)
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Where both these colors are correct (salmon and orange), gas fill is
  probably not the immediate problem.
 <p>
 <li>If the discharge color in the expanded areas is the same as the bore or
  more towards white or blue, the gas fill is somewhat contaminated and
  marginal - lasing may not occur (definitely not for yellow and green HeNe
  tubes).
 <p>
 <li>A slightly more pinkish discharge in the bore but with the normal orange
  color elsewhere may indicate low gas pressure and near/at end of life.
  There is no cure (but as noted above, this may be normal for some tubes).
 </ul>
<p>
 Firing the getter (if any) or just running the tube for an extended period of
 time may clean up any slight contamination (but won't help low gas pressure).
 However, if it is very pink, blue, purple, or white, a significant amount of
 air has leaked in over time, probably via the soft-sealed Brewster windows,
 and the only cure is likely to be a tube transplant.  This is probably the
 most common problem with older external mirror HeNe lasers.  Unfortunately,
 it isn't cost effective to refill them and replacement tubes are likely to be
 very expensive - if they are available at all.
<p>
<li>Check the mirrors, Brewster windows, and any other intra-cavity optics
 for damage and clean them if necessary using the proper optics cleaning
 technique.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrcln">Cleaning of Laser Optics</A>
 for the recommended procedure.
<p>
<li>The only remaining cause of a non-lasing laser with a proper discharge
 color and clean optics is mirror alignment.  If the laser was dropped (Ack!)
 or someone decided the alignment screws were loose and tightened them, see
 the section: >Sam's Approach for Aligning an External Mirror Laser with the
 Mirrors in Place</A> or the more general procedures starting in the section:
 <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrail">External Mirror Laser Cleaning and Alignment
 Techniques</A>.
<p>
 Of course, this assumes that the optics are correct for the laser or that
 someone didn't remove a mirror for use in their science fair project!  Note
 that alignment is super critical, especially for a long HeNe laser.  Thus,
 if misalignment is found to be the problem, it may require a lot of patience,
 determination, and the proper jigs, to remedy it.  You won't succeed by luck
 alone (though luck may play a part)!
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="htremhc">External Mirror HeNe Laser Health Checklist</A></h3>

When considering the acquisition of a large-frame HeNe laser, here are
some specific things to look at or questions that can be asked of the
owner which will help to determine if the laser is likely to be functional
near original specifications.  The following applies directly to external
mirror Spectra-Physics HeNe laser tubes with minor modifications for other
manufacturers/models:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tube integrity:</b> Obviously, a broken tube probably won't lase. :)
 The one exception is if the ballast resistor tube of Spectra-Physics model
 120, 122, 124, and some others is fractured.  This is isolated from the
 main tube and gas reservoir so does not affect performance, though proper
 insulation will be required.
<p>
<li><b>Hard versus soft-seal:</b> A hard-seal tube will have Brewster windows
 that have been either attached with frit seals (smaller tubes) or optically
 contacted.  Optically contacted seals are best if done properly.  The tube
 bore or extension is cut at the proper angle and then lapped and polished.
 The polished Brewster window is contacted to this in a clean room environment
 after both pieces have been thoroughly cleaned.  If the two surfaces are
 optically flat, the result should be a gas-tight low stress seal.  A small
 bead of adhesive is then applied simply for added mechanical strength but
 doesn't need to be gas-tight.  Like hard-seal internal mirror laser tubes,
 the shelf life of an optically contacted tube should be nearly infinite and
 is thus more desirable (and likely newer).
<p>
<li><b>Getter:</b> Spectra-Physics HeNe laser tubes have a getter spot which is
 normally a dark silvery color.  As it is used up, it either turns milky-white
 or disappears altogether.  Thus, a tube with no evidence of a getter spot
 near the getter electrode (at the end of the cathode bulb) or only a milky
 deposit, is likely to be dead or on its way out.  However, if on the
 borderline, running the tube for a few hours may restore it to almost
 spec'd power (but it probably won't be as "hot" as a new tube).
 One with a very small amount of remaining getter may still be functional.
 Running this or a revived tube periodically should keep it there, possibly
 indefinitely.
<p>
<li><b>Brown deposits in bore:</b> These will likely be most obvious near the
 IR suppression magnet poles.  The brown deposits in themselves don't imply
 anything about the performance of the laser but are an indication that it
 has been run for thousands of hours.
<p>
<li><b>Mirrors:</b> Depending on storage conditions, the mirrors may be dirty
 or damaged.  A careful visual inspection should be performed from either end.
 DO NOT remove the Brewster covers unless you are sure optics cleaning is
 needed.  The space between the mirror and Brewster window is fairly well
 sealed and should remain quite clean unless the cover is removed.
</ul>
<p>
Once the laser can be powered up, check the discharge color in the bore.
It should be similar to the bright white-ish red-orange or 'salmon' color
at the top of <A HREF="henedcol.gif">Color of HeNe Laser Tube Discharge
and Gas Fill</A>, or of any other fully functional HeNe laser tube.  If it
does not, either the tube is soft-seal and has leaked, or it has been
very totally abused.  See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrsstl">HeNe Tube Use and Life Expectancy</A>.
If the discharge color looks good, then very likely mirror alignment is
all that is needed to achieve at least a substantial fraction of full power.

<h3><A NAME="htriopw">Can I Increase Output Power Using the Waste Beam from
 the HR?</A></h3>

When operating a bare HeNe laser tube, you've no doubt noticed the weak beam
that exits from the supposedly totally reflecting mirror (the HR or High
Reflector).  (This assumes it isn't covered with tape or paint.)  So, could
the power from the output end of the laser be increased by putting another
mirror behind the HR?
<p>
The quick answer is that this might be possible in theory.
<p>
The practical answer is: forget it.
<p>
The long answer is too involved to go into here but if the extra mirror were
properly aligned AND an exact multiple of 1/2 wavelength of 632.8 nm from the
other mirror AND if there were no losses from the non-AR coated HR surfaces,
part of the wasted power might appear at the output.
<p>
But, in the end, all you would gain at most would be the couple microwatts
that escapes out the HR. :)  The lost power isn't much on most tubes.  For
those occasional tubes where the output is significant from the HR (either
because of a mistake in manufacture or by design), there might be more benefit
but as a practical matter, there is no way to satisfy all the conditions in a
stable manner without a fancy feedback loop, if at all.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Assuming it's a standard TEM00 mode HeNe and not a multimode laser, you'd
see little tiny increases and decreases in the power on a very sensitive
power meter as the mirror was translated toward and away from the existing 
rear mirror. But you would not really recover any of the rear beam, in fact
you'd confuse the lasing going on inside the main cavity somewhat, and at
certain possible "magic" combinations of external reflector and distance,
cause lasing to actually cease. In practice, HeNe lasers tend to run by
default at their maximum possible  gain for a given combination of tube
optics. 
<p>
If you want to see one wink out or flicker, precisely anchor it to a
stable bench and then use a third flat mirror some distance away on a
precision mount to reflect the output back down the bore. When the
reflected beam is 180 degrees or so out of phase with the wave in the
cavity, it will wink and flicker. 
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I wonder about this...
<p>
To actually interfere with lasing in a typical HeNe laser may be more
difficult than Steve claims.  While flickering and apparent instability
will be seen if this experiment is done with a common HeNe tube, it may only
be a result of the output beam interfering with itself outside the cavity when
reflected back to the OC.  This could appear to be confusing lasing but may
actually not cause any substantial effect inside the cavity.  Monitoring the
waste beam (as noted below) can be used to determine whether the behavior is
due to external or internal interference.  If it's only external, the waste
power will be almost unaffected (just the portion of the reflected output
beam that gets back through both the OC and HR).  This is likely to be less
than 0.1 percent of the output power or a couple percent of the waste beam
power at most.  However, if actual lasing is being affected, the waste beam
power will fluctuate significantly - up to (as Steve suggests), total
wink-outs. :)
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
On a somewhat related side note, there is at least one commercial instrument
I know of that focuses the output of a HeNe laser onto a surface, and has a
highly sensitive photodetector behind the HR of the laser (the arrangement
Steve mentioned, but in reverse).  As the surface the light is focused on
moves back and forth in relation to the laser, the photodiode detects changes
in output power out the back end.  Basically, this is a form of a Fabry-Perot
interferometer which can be used to very precisely measure small distances.

<h3><A NAME="htrroph">Reducing the Output Power of a HeNe Laser</A></h3>

Anyone who asks to do this is generally referred to a good therapist :) but
there can be valid reasons to limit the output power from a laser to a fixed
maximum.  One such reason would be to fall within a particular laser safety
classification like Class IIIA (5 mW).  There are a variety of techniques
to reduce the output power of a HeNe laser but only some are reversible:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>External optical filter:</b> This is certainly the lowest risk approach
 since it doesn't require messing with the mirror alignment or anything else
 that could cause damage.  Lasers are often shipped with red or neutral density
 filters mounted at a slight angle (to prevent back-reflection and etalon
 effects) in the output beam.  For example, the Melles Griot 05-LHR-911, a
 common laser that had been used widely for patient alignment in medical
 scanners, may have a little square piece of neutral density of varying OD
 factors glued inside the output end-cap of the laser head.  It was cheaper
 to do this than to guarantee that any given tube would be low enough power
 to meet the Class II (less than 1 mW) requirements.  An adjustable
 (variable density) filter provides even more flexibility.
<p>
<li><b>Mirror alignment:</b> Over a range of several 10s of percent, slightly
 misaligning one of the mirrors can drop the output power while not affecting
 the TEM00 mode, pointing accuracy, or stability.  With care, this is a simple
 and reversible procedure so that when the output power drops after many hours
 of use, the power may be at least partially restored.  It's usually least
 shocking to do this at the cathode-end of the tube. :)
<p>
<li><b>Reverse polarity sputtering:</b> Where there will *never* be any desired
 to regain the lost power, running the laser tube with reverse polarity will
 sputter overcoat the anode-end mirror very quickly with power declining in
 minutes and exactly 0.0 mW after around 15 minutes.  However, despite this
 actually being employed by laser companies at times, it is consider cruel
 and unusual punishment for the poor laser.
<p>
<li><b>Operating current:</b> The optimal tube current also often results in
 maximum output power (at least for most healthy red HeNe lasers).  So, it
 may be possible to run the tube on slightly lower current to reduce output
 power.  However, some tubes, particularly those with high mileage, will have
 a dropout current close to the operating current so the range will be rather
 limited.  And, optimal performance with respect to minimum optical noise also
 usually coincides with the nominal tube current so that would also be a
 consideration.  The maximum range will be order of 20 percent or less in
 any case.
</ul>

<h2>Connections, Electrical Characteristics, Output Power</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htridc0">Identifying Connections to Unmarked HeNe Tube or Laser Head</A></h3>

Where you can visually inspect the wiring, this is trivial as we all know
that the large aluminum 'can' electrode is the cathode (negative) terminal.
<p>
CAUTION: While most modern HeNe tubes use the mirror mounts for the high
voltage connections, there are exceptions and older tubes may have unusual
arrangements where the anode is just a wire fused into the glass and/or the
cathode has a terminal separate from the mirror mount at that end of the tube.
Take note of the cathode arrangement in particular because the tube will still
lase perfectly if you attach to the mirror mount but instead of the actual
cathode but that will result in sputtering near the mirror which is about the
worst place for this - similar to running the tube on reverse polarity.
(Miswiring the anode might result in no or weak lasing but probably no
permanent damage.)
<p>
<b>Alden high voltage connector</b>
<p>
The two pin Alden is by far the most common connector used for attaching
HeNe laser heads to HeNe laser power supplies.  They are used by
almost all manufacturers and for lasers almost all sizes.  The shorter
(narrower) side goes to the anode (positive) and the longer (fatter) side
goes to the cathode (negative).  When such a connector is present, there
will also be a ballast resistor (typically about 75K ohms) built into the
HeNe tube assembly or laser head between the Alden's positive terminal and the anode.
<p>
<PRE>
                              ________-__

</PRE>
<p>
Or see <A HREF="alden.gif">High Voltage Cable with Male Alden Connector</A>.
This one is built with separate wires and appears to have a ballast resistor
built into the anode (red) lead (or maybe it's just a wart!).  Many use coax
similar in thickness to RG58U for the HV cable instead.
<p>
Note: Genuine Alden brand connectors will have the name stamped on the plastic.
Some power supplies may come with Alden compatibles without identification.
This probably doesn't matter in any way, shape, or form, except as an
indication that the power supply manufacturer installed the connector onto
existing wiring or saved a few cents. :)  For complete info, go to
<A HREF="http://www.aldenproducts.com/">Amphenol Alden Products Company</A>.
Go to "Products", "High Voltage Connectors and Cable Assemblies".
<p>
<b>Three pin in-line high voltage connector</b>
<p>
Some larger HeNe lasers (mostly from Siemens and Spectra-Physics) use a
connector somewhat similar to the standard Alden but it is more rectangular
with 3 pins instead of 2.  And, the pins on both of the connectors (male
and female) are recessed to avoid the shocking experience of touching
the pins on a recently detached laser head and getting zapped!
<p>
CAUTION: The pinouts for Siemens and Spectra-Physics lasers have the
HV pins swapped!  Using the wrong one may result in very rapid destruction
of laser head and/or power supply, not to mention a possible shocking
experience!
<p>
<PRE>
  Pin Location     Siemens     Spectra-Physics
 ----------------------------------------------
  Square end     Earth Ground   Earth-Ground
  Middle         Cathode (-)      Anode (+)
  Round end       Anode (+)      Cathode (-)
</PRE>
<p>
For these large laser heads, there may also be a small ballast resistor
in series with the cathode lead.  Bypassing it will reduce operating
voltage requirements and the laser will probably still work fine though
the claim is that stability will be better with it when used with the
recommended power supply.
<p>
<b>Three pin round High voltage connector</b>
<p>
Some Spectra-Physics lasers use a special 3 pin round connector (view
is looking toward power supply):
<p>
<PRE>
               O  Positive (Anode)
               1
      GND  O 3   2 O  Negative (Cathode)
           
               o  Interlock Prong
</PRE>
<p>
The GND may not actually be present on some power supplies.  In most cases, it
is already connected to the negative elsewhere.  The interlock prong
activates a microswitch in the power supply to complete the primary-side
circuit only if the power supply and laser head are securely attached.
This provides protection for the power supply but isn't present on all
models.  (If your laser refuses to lase and there is no interlock prong, it's
possible that the power supply requires it.  It's either fallen or broken
off, or the power supply isn't the one intended for your laser head.)
<p>
<b>No standard high voltage connector</b>
<p>
However, suppose the whole thing is sealed and all we have are some dangling
wires or an unusual unmarked connector?  Here are some guidelines.  Try to
obtain agreement on several of the following tests as no single one is
necessarily a guarantee of correct identification:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The anode connection will be the center conductor if the cable is a coaxial
 type, the fat wire if they are not the same diameter, or the red one if they
 are color coded.
<p>
<li>If there is an expanded section on one of the wires, this is probably the
 ballast resistor and the wire thus connects to the HeNe tube anode.
<p>
<li>The cathode (but never the anode) may be electrically connected to the
 metal case of a laser head or through a small (e.g., 10K) resistor.  Check
 it with an ohmmeter.  There is a single partial exception to this rule:
 The Spectra-Physics 119 laser has the laser tube anode attached to the
 chassis via an 80K ohm ballast resistor in series with a 4400 ohm sense
 resistor with the cathode floating at a high negative voltage.  This is
 an artifact of the vacuum tube-based (!!) used in the SP-119 HeNe laser
 power supply and it is extremely ancient - almost pre-Jurrasic. :)  (See
 the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp119">SP-119 Laser
 Head with SP-259 Exciter</A> for general info.
<p>
<li>Measure the capacitance between each of the connections and the case (if it
 is metal) or a sheet of aluminum foil wrapped around the HeNe tube itself or
 the case (if it is non-metallic).  Since the cathode electrode has a large
 surface area and is connected directly or nearly directly to the negative
 input, it may test with a higher capacitance to the case or foil.
<p>
<li>If there is a rubber potting compound preventing you from getting at the
 electrode connections but you can identify which end of the tube is which, a
 straight pin can be carefully inserted through this material to check
 continuity to the external wiring:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If possible, do this at the cathode-end to avoid any possibility of
  future problems from the hole you leave behind (since the electrode is at
  ground or a relatively low voltage with no starting voltage to worry about
  arcing).  There there should be continuity or a low resistance (e.g., 10K)
  between your pin-probe and the negative connection.  A piece of electrical
  tape over the hole should provide adequate insulation.
<p>
 <li>If inserted at the anode-end, there should be either continuity or the
  value of the ballast resistor (around 75K) to the positive connection.
  To insulate from the starting voltage, two layers of electrical tape are
  probably adequate or use a glob of RTV silicone.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>If all else fails, attach the HeNe tube (don't forget the ballast
 resistor!) or laser head to a variable HeNe laser power supply - flip a coin
 to determine polarity for this test ONLY.  I have found that HeNe tubes will
 often start more easily when the connections are REVERSED but will then have
 a higher effective series resistance.  In other words, the tube will come on
 at a lower input voltage but it will then need to be cranked up higher for
 the same discharge current.  Try it both ways and then select the one with
 the higher starting voltage and lower operating voltage.
<p>
 CAUTION: Do not run the HeNe tube with reversed polarity for more than a
 few seconds!  While red tubes may survive for a few minutes with reverse
 polarity before the power decreases significantly,
 "other color", particularly yellow and green ones may be totally ruined
 due to their low gain.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htridc1">Getting the HeNe Tube Out of a Laser Head
 Intact</A></h3>

If the tube is bad and won't be salvaged, more drastic means can be used.
However, assuming you want to extract it intact and with a chance of being
reused, the choices narrow dramatically.
<p>
With rectangular laser heads, the actual HeNe tube will probably be mounted in
a sane fashion - with screws and clamps for example.  So, no problem if you
have the correct screwdrivers.  In rare cases (particularly for modern
large ones, you may find that there is a cylindrical laser head inside!
And some (like those from Spectral) seem to be glued together.
<p>
For cylindrical laser heads, the tube may be mounted in a variety of
ways.  Just getting the end-caps off can be a fun experience as well.  They may
be mounted with screws or set screws (for which Murphy's law states you won't
have the correct hex wrench), rivets (some drilling required), just glue (which
will likely be hard and brittle by the time you need to do this - probably an
advantage).  As for the tube, there may be (plastic) set screws at 3 or 4
points around the outside in two locations - front and back.  In this case,
loosening the set screws should allow the tube to be slid out of the housing.
If it still doesn't move, check for additional anchors or wiring connections
at either end.  If it still doesn't move, there may be some RTV, hot melt
glue, or other adhesive in a hidden locations still securing it.
<p>
Often, you will find that the tube itself has been set in place with Silicone
RTV forced through holes on the side to keep it there.  Unfortunately, removing
these tubes intact appears to be right up there with dropping bare eggs from
10th story windows and having them survive unbroken in the level of difficulty
department. :)  However, it can be done without dynamite.  (But, before
going through any of the following RTV removal gymnastics, determine if the
adhesive is actually something less stable than RTV, see below.)
<p>
As we all know, Silicone RTV, a.k.a. GE Bathtub Caulk, be it white, black, or
clear, is impervious to virtually everything but a good sharp blade.  If there
is enough clearance around the tube, it may be possible to slip a thin strip
of metal in there and carefully slice the RTV from each end.  I've done this
to extract a couple of HeNe tubes intact.  The first was dead (up to air) so I
wasn't too worried about breaking it.  I used thin aluminum strips (e.g., roof
flashing) from either end and through the fill holes to grind away at the RTV
until the tube could be removed - surviving with just a few scratches as
aluminum is softer than glass!  This literally took HOURS!  However, there is
often not even enough clearance for this to be possible.  For my laser head,
this was the case on *opposite* sides at each end even for the .015" aluminum.
Only when enough RTV had been removed on the side with more clearance could it
be worked loose.  (In addition to the tube being dead, it had been mounted
skewed in its cylindrical prison - someone must have had a really bad day when
this thing was put together!)  The second tube was weak (putting out only
about 1/3 mW when it should have been 2 mW).  It came out quite easily (still
putting out only 1/3 mW) as the adhesive was localized and could be sliced
with a single pass of my 'tool' for each small glob of RTV.
<p>
Sometimes a hard non-RTV type adhesive is used in a similar manner to the RTV.
For this, a narrow coping saw or model maker's saw blade between the tube and
housing should work quite well.
<p>
If you don't care about saving the housing, very carefully use a hacksaw to
remove it as close as possible to the adhesive clumps (near the ends of
the HeNe tube).  This will make it easier to get at the glue with a thin
knife, saw, razor blade, or that roof flashing.  A copper tubing cutter may
even work for this but go real slow or the distortion of the housing may
crunch the tube. :(
<p>
One might think a chemical exists capable of dissolving RTV that isn't totally
toxic and disgusting.  Such a substance would make this task a whole lot
easier.  Is there?
<p>
(From: Mark Schweter (schweter@mail.bright.net)).
<p>
Short of ashing the assembly (which will strip your wires for you too!), not
really. (Considering the NON_toxic, NON_disgusting requirements - assuming
you mean Silicone RTV, fuming HF or HNO3 comes to mind!)
<p>
Fully cured RTV is fairly stable, unfortunately.
<p>
You might try a NaOH solution to digest the RTV, if nothing else, it'll take
the aluminum 'can' off! (NO smoking in the area PLEASE - HYDROGEN is released!)
<p>
A thought occurs to me....  Get a 'slitting saw' or 'burr' and slice the
aluminum can lengthwise, several times.  Use a hot-knife to peel away the
RTVed sections.  Then use the hot-knife to pare RTV off glassware.  My Weller
soldering gun used to have one.

<p>
I have successfully removed an old Hughes HeNe tube from such a head by using
an old piano wire (violin, cello, etc., as long as the wire was wound, it
would work).  (You hated the practicing, anyhow! :) --- Sam.)
<p>
Pass the wire down the side of tube, anchor the end, say in a vice and slowly
work the tube back and forth pressing the caulking against the wire.  The wound
wire cuts away at the caulking and after not too much time you should free the
tube.

I have yet to have a problem removing end-caps from the Melles Griot HeNe
laser heads I have had after my tried and true tested method. :-)
<p>
Fill a coffee cup about 3" high with BOILING hot water and let the head sit 
in it for about 10 min's. Repeat 3 times and the cap pops off by hand no 
problem. After it is removed, run your thumb around the inside to remove
the remaining glue.  Use a hair dryer to clear up the condensation inside
the head from the process.
<p>
Repeat for the other end. This has worked for most of the PMS and Uniphase 
heads as well.
<p>
Removing a tube from ANY head is a cinch (if you're willing to sacrifice the
aluminum cylinder) by using a hacksaw.  There is no need to remove the
end-caps in this case.  First remove any set-screws.  In Melles Griot heads
there are usually two sets of 3 (alternating with glue-only holes).  Use
a sharp blade or Dremel(tm) tool to cut a slot in the plastic and then just
unscrew them (COUNTER-CLOCKWISE!).  Next roll the head across a table while
making a mark around the middle of the head to follow with the hacksaw.  Saw
slow and carefully as not to nick the tube.  The metal is soft and wont take
too long to cut.  When the cut is finished, squeeze some liquid dish-washing
detergent (Ivory, etc...) into the head followed by some water.  Give it a
shake and then twist one way with the left hand and twist the other way with
the right and the glue will give way most easily. :-)  Make sure there are
no set-screws hidden in the RTV or whatever it is. Once one end of the case
frees up, cut the wires and pull it off.  From here do the same for tube in
one hand and half of head in the other.  Once the tube is free and still
soapy, pick off the rest of the glue and "starter tape".  Then wash 
off the tube with fresh water and use a hair dryer to dry it off to
prevent any trace of rust.
<p>
I have done this over and over again without any problems or stress to the 
laser tube.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
CAUTION: If all you have removed using the hot water trick is one or both
end-caps, DON'T attempt to run the tube until you are sure all moisture is
gone from inside the head.  Otherwise, there may be corona/arcing at various
places which at the very least, will make it hard to start and may cause
damage to the head and/or power supply.
<p>
I have simplified this tube removal technique a bit if the end-caps have been
taken off and don't need to cut the cylinder at all.  Remove the six (6) nylon
set-screws by first scribing with a sharp knife or Dremel cutoff wheel and turn
COUNTERCLOCKWISE.  Then carefully use a paper clip or knife blade to dig
out the hot-melt glue in the other six (6) holes.  (This helps to free up
the attachment to the inner wall.)  Put the head into hot water for a couple
of minutes.  Hot water from the tap is probably adequate and a bit of
dish washing liquid won't hurt to make it slide easier.  The heat also expands
the aluminum faster than the glass.  Then, finger pressure alone on
the metal cathode end-bell should be sufficient to break any remaining
attachment of the hot-melt glue and slide the tube a fraction of an inch
inside the cylinder.  Then, just push it back out from the other end.  It
may take several applications of hot sudsy water to loosen the tube but if
the set-screws have been removed and the hot-melt glue holes cleared, it
should work eventually.  I've done this with several heads without damage
to the tube inside.
<p>
CAUTION: Since this is basically a fragile glass bottle you're trying to get
out with some force (though hopefully not much), accidents can happen.
Therefore, provide some protection between the tube and your fingers when
pushing.
<p>
I know this works with hot-melt glue-mounted tubes.  This includes most or all
newer Melles Griot tubes but some older Aerotech tubes use generous amounts
of very resilient RTV which may not loosen up at all.  If you're real lucky,
your tube is just held in place with set-screws, like NEC.  And some Aerotech
heads have minimal blobs of RTV with set-screws doing most of the work.
<p>
Long Uniphase HeNe laser heads (e.g., 1145/P) have 4 sets of RTV holes.
But even after gouging out all the RTV, the tube may still be held securely
with some sort of rubber padding leaving the tube still locked
in place.  Trying to push it out is made more
difficult by the rock-hard poured-in-place ballast resistor assembly at
the anode-end which only leaves the mirror mount exposed.  Trying to push
on the mirror mount at that end is asking for trouble because that's about
the weakest part of the tube where the glass structure is only about 1 inch
in diameter and relatively thin.  The hacksaw approah may be the only option
if you want the tube intact.
<p>
But, the following would appear to be the definitive word on dealing with
Melles Griot and other HeNe laser heads that use a non-RTV type rubber
for mounting the tubes.  Test a bit of the adhesive to determine if some heat
will soften it - if so, your task is much easier.

<h3><A NAME="htrrhnt">Replacing the HeNe Tube in a Melles Griot Laser
 Head</A></h3>

So you found a new tube with 10 times the output power of that tired,
bedraggled, worn old one taking up space inside a cylindrical laser head and
it would be nice to replace it.  This <b>is</b> possible as noted above but
the following is perhaps the semi-official way of doing it and applies
directly to most Melles Griot cylindrical laser heads but others may be
similar.
<p>
Note that some of the recommeded procedures will stink up the house so you
may want to do this somewhere else like someone else's house. :)
<p>
(From: Lynn Strickland (stricks760@earthlink.net).)
<p>
The HeNe tube is usually mounted and aligned using nylon screws, then potted
with RTV Silicone or hot-melt glue, and then the screws are cut off.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Take off the end-caps (if it has any) by first clamping the head lightly
 in a vice.  Heat the ends of the housing with a heat-gun, one at a time, and
 when the epoxy starts to smell, pull the end-caps off with a pair of locking
 pliers.  Piece of cake, but don't burn yourself.  Oh, some heads have
 pressed-in metal end-caps. If it does, you're on your own. (I have been known
 to use a pipe cutter though).
<p>
<li>Look at the head and find the potting holes.  Half will probably be Nylon
 screws.  Heat up an exacto blade and melt a small slot into the screws.
 Then unscrew them, and save them for later.
<p>
<li>If the alternate holes are hot-melt (and they probably are), put the
 entire head in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes to soften the hot-melt, then
 push the tube out of the housing. It kind of smells up the kitchen if
 you're not careful, and I take no responsibility if you burn down your
 house.
<p>
<li>Suspend the new tube inside the housing, using Nylon screws.  (You saved,
 them, correct?)
<p>
<li>Ideally, you would then re-tweak the mirror alignment once it's mounted
 inside the housing.  A filed down hex wrench can be used on the locking
 collar at the cathode/output-end but it isn't easy and you'll probably be
 okay to skip it.  A better method is to carefully drill access holes for
 a hex wrench opposite each of the three adjustment screws in the side of
 the cylinder.  Tweaking the anode-end mirror without getting shocked is
 the real challenge though and I would definitely recommend skipping it!
 Putting the end-caps back might help stabilize it a bit more, but you've
 won most of the battle already.
</ol>

To disassemble, I first remove the screw in plugs by slicing into them with a
hobby knife and then unscrew them.  After that, I put on a pair of thick
gloves and heat them in front of a ready heater until they're hot enough to
push the tube out of the aluminum housing.  Then, I clean the melted rubber
off of the glass.
<p>
I also have heads here that I reassembled. I put the centering plugs back in,
screwed them all down flush leaving the tube snug and centered.  Then, I
inject black RTV Silicone into the other holes.  After the RTV it cures then
I trim the plug with a razor blade to leave a smooth fill level with the
aluminum.  Just looking at it, you can't tell they were ever disassembled.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
So with RTV, the <i>next guy</i> to attempt to disassemble the head will
be using all the 4 letter words. :)

<h3><A NAME="htridc2">Determining Electrical Characteristics of Unmarked HeNe
 Tube or Laser Head</A></h3>

So, you found this fabulous HeNe laser in the dumpster and would like to power
it.  There are no markings of any kind - not even the manufacturer is known.
If it is a laser head, the tube itself may be labeled - if you can get to it
nondestructively.  Where even the tube is unmarked, start by narrowing down
the range of expected electrical characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Attempt to match its physical size to the HeNe tubes listed in the section:
  <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht0">Typical HeNe Tube Specifications</A> or the
  catalogs of HeNe tube manufacturers.
<p>
<li>Use the following very approximate rules of thumb:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Operating Current = Tube bore diameter in mm * 6 mA.
 <li>Operating Voltage = Tube length in mm * 6 V.
 <li>Starting Voltage = 3 to 5 times the operating voltage.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
The rest is experimentation.  You will need an HeNe laser power supply capable
of handling a tube with the worst case voltage and current based on its size.
Make sure you include a 75 K ohm ballast resistor of adequate wattage (10 W
will be sufficient for anything up to 10 mA).  A laser head will usually have
an internal ballast resistor.  Make sure the polarity is correct - see the
section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htridc0">Identifying Connections to Unmarked
HeNe Tube or Laser Head</A>.
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using a regulated power supply with a variable current control,
  set it to the guestimate from the equations, above.  Make sure its compliance
  is adequate should your HeNe tube turn out to be at the low end of the
  operating voltage range.
<p>
<li>If you are using an unregulated power supply and Variac, start low and work
  your way up until the tube starts.
</ul>
<p>
Once you get the tube to light, adjust the current for maximum beam intensity.
Running at slightly higher than optimal current won't do any immediate damage
but shouldn't be allowed to continue for too long.  It's best to do this with
a laser power meter but your standard complement of eyeballs will be close
enough for most purposes.  If using a meter (you probably won't notice the
following effects visually), give the tube a few seconds to stabilize after a
change in current - sometimes the power output may initially increase but then
settle back to a lower level and you might as well operate the tube at the
lowest current that results in maximum output.  Then, label the HeNe tube
or laser head with your findings so you will know how to deal with it the next
time you pull it out of the cabinet. :-)

<h3><A NAME="htrmnrh">Measuring the Negative Resistance of a HeNe Tube</A></h3>

This is probably more of an academic exercise than anything else.  However,
a change in the tube's voltage versus current characteristics could indicate
a problem with gas fill composition or pressure, or damaged or deteriorated
electrode(s).  A comparison between the suspect tube and an identical model
that works could be revealing.
<p>
For currents within and well beyond the normal operating range, a HeNe tube
acts as a negative resistance - reducing the current results in an increase
of tube voltage and vice-versa.  Reducing current also results in an increase
in the magnitude of the incremental negative resistance.  Below 2 mA or so for
a typical small HeNe tube, this magnitude rises so quickly that it is
impossible to maintain a discharge even with very large values of ballast
resistance.  Going the other way, at some very large current (probably
measured in amps), the incremental resistance turns positive (just before the
tube melts or explodes!).  For any given HeNe tube, power supply, and ballast
resistor combination, there will be a range of current over which the
discharge will remain stable.  This is roughly the range over which the
negative resistance of the tube plus the effective resistance of the ballast
resistor, power supply, and regulator (if used) remains positive.
<p>
Measuring resistance, negative or otherwise, is just a matter of determining
the relationship of voltage to current for the device.  It is trivial for
common electronic components but more complicated for HeNe tubes due to the
high voltage (particularly the starting voltage) produced by the power supply.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsspm1">Making Measurements on HeNe
Laser Power Supplies</A>.)  However, if you have a high impedance high voltage
probe for you DMM or VOM, or a high voltage meter, it can be left attached even
during starting without fear of a melt-down (though even its high resistance
and small capacitance may alter tube behavior and/or prevent starting).
<p>
One straightforward approach will require the following:
<ul>
<li>A HeNe laser power supply with a variable output current that will drive
 the tube in question.  This can be a regulated supply with a current adjust
 pot or an unregulated, but well filtered supply with a Variac for the input.
 A wide current range will result in a nice complete graph of tube resistance.
 However, even a 5 or 10 percent range - as long as it includes the nominal
 tube current - will permit the resistance at that point to be determined.
<p>
<li>A voltmeter with a known input resistance (e.g., a 20,000 ohm/volt VOM on
 its 1,000 V range - 20 M ohms).  A DMM can be used as well (usually 10 M ohm
 input resistance).  However, they may be more susceptible to damage from
 excessive high voltage (e.g., the starter kicks in unexpectedly!).  A basic
 meter movement (say, 100 uA) and suitable current limiting resistor (rated
 for the high voltage) can also be used.
<p>
<li>A 1M ohm or greater value resistor rated for the maximum operating voltage
 of the power supply (e.g., 10, 2M resistors in series).  This isolates the
 meter's lead and input capacitance from the tube anode.  Otherwise, the tube
 would drop out at the instant the meter was connected.  (If you are measuring
 the voltage prior to the starter and your meter has a high enough voltage
 range, this can be eliminated.)
<p>
<li>A nice piece of graph paper or a PC and suitable software. :)
</ul>
A typical circuit is shown below:

</PRE>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a sealed laser head which prevents convenient access to the
 tube anode, put Rm and the VOM at the output of the power supply prior to the
 ballast resistor (Rb) and subtract the value of Rb (usually 75K ohms) from
 what you compute for R(n) at each point.
<p>
<li>If you can get to a point in the power supply prior to the starter, the
 risk to your meter goes down greatly and you can leave it connected at all
 times - no S1 is needed.)  As above, subtract the value of Rb and any other
 resistors in series with the tube from what you compute for R(n).
</ul>
<p>
Note: Where the VOM or DMM is connected after the starter (to the tube or
head), a power supply with a high impedance parasitic voltage multiplier
starting circuit is recommended to minimize the risk of damage to your meter
should the tube drop out during the tests.  The load of the meter will prevent
such a circuit from developing significant damaging voltage.  See the chapter:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe Laser Power Supply Schematics</A>
for some suitable designs.
<p>
To provide additional protection for your meter, consider putting a series
stack of neon bulbs (NE2s, about 90 V each) across its input to bypass any
voltage greater than the expected value while the tube is lit.  For example,
if the maximum range of your meter is 1 kV, use 11 or 12 NE2s.
<p>
For the following, I assume the circuit above.
<ul>
<li>Connect everything up with the VOM disconnected from the HeNe tube until it
 has started!  Else, either the tube won't start due to the load of the meter
 OR the meter may be damaged due to excess voltage!
<p>
<li>Adjust the current to the minimum value at which the tube remains lit and
 stable, or the minimum of the available adjustment range, whichever is
 greater.
<p>
<li>While WELL INSULATED, close S1. (I assume that unless you are expecting to
 evaluate a few dozen tubes, S1 is just a clip lead!)
<p>
<li>If the HeNe tube goes out, open S1, increase the current slightly, and
 try again.  At the very low end of the range, almost anything will cause the
 tube to go out!
<p>
<li>Open S2 to put the VOM in the circuit.
<p>
<li>Record the voltage for every .1 or .2 mA over as wide a range as is
 available - up to 50 percent above nominal tube voltage if possible.  (The
 tube won't be damaged during the few seconds required to take the readings
 at the higher than normal current.)  Don't forget to correct for the effect
 of the isolating resistor, Rm, on the VOM's sensitivity.  In this case,
 multiply by 2.
<p>
<li>Plot V(n) versus I(n).  This shows the actual V-I characteristic of the
 HeNe tube.  The slope of this curve is the resistance.  Note that it does
 have a negative slope indicating negative resistance - increasing current
 actually decreases the voltage across the tube.  Of course, unlike a normal
 positive (linear) resistor, the curve is only valid over a portion of the
 current range - there is no 0,0 intercept!
<p>
<li>Compute the incremental (negative) resistance, R(n), at each point from:
<p>
 <PRE>
                             V(n+1) - V(n-1)
                     R(n) = -----------------
                             I(n+1) - I(n-1)
 </PRE>
<p>
<li>Plot R(n) versus I(n). This shows the incremental negative resistance as a
 function of tube current.  What is the value at the nominal current for your
 HeNe tube?
</ul>
<p>
I ran some tests on several small HeNe tubes using the following slightly
modified circuit:

Depending on the voltage requirements of the tube, I used either
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat1">Aerotech Model PS1 HeNe Laser Power Supply
(AT-PS1)</A> (most tubes up to 1 mW), <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat2">Aerotech
Model PS2B HeNe Laser Power Supply (AT-PS2B)</A> (tubes above 1 mW), or
a Melles Griot 05-LPM-379 (for the 05-LHR-640 tube).  Current
control was via the adjustable internal regulator when using AT-PS1 or
05-LPM-379 but with a Variac for AT-PS2B (its regulator is currently
disabled).  Both of the Aerotech units have parasitic voltage multiplier
starters and with the circuit wired as shown above, even if the tube cuts
out, the maximum voltage doesn't go above about 2.5 or 4 kV for the AT-PS1
and AT-PS2B, respectively (maximum of 400 V at the DMM itself).  The output
of the 05-LPM-379 may go somewhat above 400 V under these conditions but
the Radio Shack DMM I'm using doesn't seem to mind.

<p>
The '*' denotes the approximate recommended operating current for the tube
(more or less guessed if the data wasn't available!).  Below the lowest
current listed for each tube, the magnitude of the (negative) resistance
increased beyond the point where stability could be maintained with the 75K
ballast resistor and the tube would not remain lit.  It is interesting that
the two lowest power tubes (both 12.5 cm long, bore approximately 0.5 mm) have
their operating points close to the dropout current. Rb for these tubes is
typically increased to 100K or more to assure stability.
<p>
The LHB-570 is a wide bore multimode one-Brewster HeNe tube so the 4 mW is
actually only valid for a particular OC mirror.  Note the low operating
voltage and magnitude of of the negative resistance for this tube.
<p>
I'll add other tubes as the opportunity presents itself.
<p>
Due to the effects on the V-I characteristics with temperature, there was some
drift in the readings.  For example, going to the highest current listed above
for a particular tube and then back to the lowest current resulted in perhaps
a 1 to 2 percent change in voltage until the tube cooled down.
<p>
More sophisticated analysis is left as an exercise for the student. :)

<h3><A NAME="htridc3">Determining Output Power</A></h3>

This would be easy with a laser power meter.  However, most of us are not so
fortunate as to own such an instrument.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm0">What Makes a Laser Power Meter So
Expensive?</A>.  There are two aspects of this same problem:
<p>
<ol>
<li>What is the specified power output of a given HeNe tube?
<li>Is your tube really producing its specified output power?
</ol>
<p>
Note: There will often be a CDRH safety sticker (usually yellow or white) on
the HeNe tube or laser head.  The wattage listed on this sticker is NOT a
reliable indication of output power.  It is an upper bound and may be much
higher than either the rated or actual output power.  For example, a .5 mW
laser will likely have a safety sticker value of 1 mW; a 1 or 2 mW laser will
show 5 mW; and a 12 mW laser may show 15 or 25 mW.  Some unscrupulous or
careless HeNe laser or tube resellers will list this as the power output of
the device - buyer beware!  Few people can or will check this.  If it sounds
to good to be true, it probably is. :-(
<ol>
<li>There are a few ways of determining the tube's specified output power:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Some manufacturers code the (usually minimum) output power into the model
  number.  For example, Aerotech tubes and laser heads have a model number
  that is of the form: XYZ where X is the model designation, Y is the
  output power in mW (e.g., 2 = 2 mW, 05 = .5 mW, etc.) and Z is either R
  or P denoting a random or linearly polarized beam respectively.
<p>
 <li>Match the model number of the tube or laser head to the manufacturer's
  catalog listing.  This may be easier said than done since many surplus
  tubes either don't have a model number printed on them or are old enough
  (but still perfectly good) so that the model is no longer listed in a
  current catalog.  The manufacturer (if they still exist) will know and
  contacting them may be worth the effort.  However, don't expect an
  overly enthusiastic response if you are asking about a 10 year old $20
  HeNe tube!  Any information so obtained may not be accurate either.
<p>
 <li>Attempt to compare the physical dimensions with those of tubes with known
  output power.  This is not very reliable as the output power of a tube of
  identical diameter and length can easily vary by a factor of two or more
  by design or just due to sample-to-sample variations (at the time of
  manufacture, tubes are selected and sold based on their actual output
  power but they may appear to be physically identical).
<p>
 <li>Try to locate an indication on the tube itself of *measured* power
  output.  Very often, the actual power output determined at the time of
  manufacture will be hand written or printed somewhere on the tube.  This
  may be on the glass or metal shield (if used) or one of the ends.  It may
  be on the outside of a laser head on the manufacturer's specification
  sticker (not the safety sticker, see above) or concealed inside.  Examine
  every nook and cranny and the tube's secrets may very well be revealed!
<p>
 <li>Attempt to use the following equation to calculate expected output power:
<PRE>
                                      q * L
                   Po = T * A * I * (------- - 1)
                                      T + B
</PRE>
  Where:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>T is the output coupler (OC) transmission in percent.
  <li>A is the cross sectional area of the beam.
  <li>I is a saturation parameter.
  <li>q is the small signal gain.
  <li>L is the gain length.
  <li>B is the sum of all cavity losses.
  </ul>
<p>
  For the typical internal mirror HeNe laser tube, q =.15/m and B will be close
  to 0 assuming there is no internal Brewster plate or etalon.  A and L can
  be measured for your HeNe tube.  Unfortunately, T and I are likely to be
  unknown but they can perhaps be estimated by comparison with another HeNe
  tube having a known power output.  This would make an excellent exercise for
  the student! :-)
<p>
  However, what this equation does show is that all other factors being equal,
  when comfortably above the lasing threshold of (q * L)/(T + B) > 1, output
  power is proportional to bore length times its cross sectional area.  But we
  already knew that!
<p>
  Of course, as noted above, the actual output power for any given sample tube
  of identical construction and dimensions can easily vary by a factor of two.
  The calculated value is at best the theoretical maximum - when the tube is
  new (or at its peak if initially overfilled with helium to compensate for
  loss over time), under ideal conditions, and possibly only on alternate
  Thursdays! :)
 </ul>
<p>
<li>It is much tougher to determine if the output of your HeNe tube is actually
 correct without a calibrated laser power meter.  However, comparisons can
 be made.
<p>
 Maximum output power isn't achieved instantly for an HeNe laser when
 power is applied.  Typically, it starts at 75 to 85 percent of its final
 value and reaches that only after a 10 to 20 minute warmup period.  For
 long tubes or large frame lasers, an hour may be needed for the output
 power to stabilize.  I've also noticed that power seems to peak and then
 decline slightly for many tubes during this warmup period.  I don't know if
 this is an inherent properly due to the increasing temperature of the bore
 or just a matter of mirror adjustments not being optimal.  Power also may
 take a few seconds or longer to stabilize after even a small change in
 operating current.  Depending on where you are on the current versus output
 curve, it may go up and stay up, go down and stay down, or do one of these
 and then return to nearly its former value.
<p>
 In addition, for high power really long HeNe tubes (e.g., 15 mW or more)
 and/or unconventional HeNe tubes used in high quality lasers, there may be
 other physical factors affecting power output including mirror
 micro-adjustments, need for IR line suppressing or discharge stabilization
 magnets, rigid temperature and external force stabilized mounting, and even
 tube orientation (like: This Side Up!).  In fact, where you have a weak
 beam or even no beam at all, gently pressing in the center of these long
 tubes (which bends them ever so slightly) can be a useful technique to
 determine which way the mirror alignment is off without actually touching
 the mirror mounts (though you will have to do this eventually to make the
 adjustments).  In fact, just touching one side of the tube with your hand
 will cool it slightly and may result in a significant change in output
 power due to the change in mirror alignment due to thermal contraction and
 bending of the tube!
<p>
 For lasers with very long bores that are exposed (e.g., the SP-127), there
 may be one or more adjustments along the length of the bore to fine adjust
 its straightness.  While slight misadjustment of these won't result in no
 beam, it could certainly greatly reduce power output.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My Tube
 is Good?</A>.   However, none of these should be a major factor for small
 common inexpensive HeNe tubes (though there still may be some effects).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>First, confirm that you are supplying the proper operating current.  The
  output beam power will be maximum at the proper current - lower on either
  side.  A power supply with a broken regulator could be producing greatly
  increased current which will result in much reduced output (and excessive
  heating, sputtering, and shortened tube life - and probably won't do the
  power supply much good either).  At 2 to 3 times the rated current, there
  may be no beam at all!
<p>
 <li>If you have access to a working HeNe laser or a new HeNe tube with known
  output, this is best as the wavelength will be the same.  But, keep in
  mind that a 4:1 ratio of beam intensity represents a perceived brightness
  ratio that is closer to 2:1.
<p>
 <li>If you have a (diode) laser pointer of known power and wavelength, it
  can be used.  However, this gets to be complicated if the wavelength AND
  power differ (as is likely with many laser pointers (670 nm) at this
  time.  In addition, power levels for laser pointers are maximums and the
  actual power is not generally known.
 </ul>
<p>
 Estimating relative power works better on your finger or palm (don't worry,
 you won't even be able to detect a 5 mW HeNe beam on your flesh from the
 any heating effect but don't do this with a 20 W argon laser!) in the raw
 beam than on a white card unless the beam is first spread out using a lens
 or equivalently and more easily accomplished, you view the spots through
 a lens to make them appear fuzzy.  In either case, the amount of perceived
 beam spread depends on output power and the difference is much more
 apparent than just looking at a tiny bright dot.
<p>
 Both the perceived brightness AND the size of the spot will vary with HeNe
 beam power.  After a little practice, estimating the output power will
 become second nature - sort of like recipe measurements: "just use a pinch
 of salt in the stew!".  However, if you have a collection of neutral
 density filters, you can use these to match brightnesses which may be just
 a bit more precise!  The laser power meter would be even better. :-)
<p>
 For <b>relative</b> power measurements, either of the simple laser diode
 based laser power meters described starting in the sections:
 <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm3">Sam's Super Cheap and Dirty Laser Power
 Meter</A> will actually work quite well.  If you can calibrate one of
 these with a HeNe laser of known power output, better than 5 percent
 accuracy is easily achieved.
<p>
 Just give the laser enough warmup time to stabilize (10 minutes for a small
 HeNe tube, up to an hour for an 8 foot long SP-125!).  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmlp">Measuring HeNe Laser Output Power</A> for
 additional tips.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="htrmlp">Measuring HeNe Laser Output Power</A></h3>

Follow these steps to reliably measure the output power of your HeNe laser
using a laser power meter (either homemade or a real one!):

<ol>
<li>Set up the laser and power meter so that the entire beam falls on the
 sensor but covers as much of it as possible (or convenient).  For a very
 small silicon photodiode, this may mean a combination of putting the sensor
 close to the laser (careful of the high voltage if a bare HeNe tube!) and
 using a focusing lens to reduce its size (but not so small as to concentrate
 it in a single dot!).
<p>
<li>Allow the laser to warm up.  Initial power is generally much lower than
 after the tube has been on for 10 to 20 minutes (even more time may be
 needed for a long HeNe tube or large frame HeNe laser to stabilize).  The
 average power may start out reduced by 15 to 25 percent or more and gradually
 creep up to its final value, often overshooting a bit before settling down.
 (I don't know whether the overshoot behavior is a fundamental characteristic
 of a HeNe laser or a symptom of less than perfect mirror alignment.  However,
 I've seen it on too many tubes to be a coincidence.)  In addition, for a
 normal (non-stabilized and non-precision) HeNe laser, expect a short term
 oscillation in power typically over a 1 to 5 percent range with a period of
 10 to 30 seconds due to longitudinal mode cycling - just get used to it!
 (The amplitude for longer tubes may be lower since a larger number of
 longitudinal modes can be active simultaneously and their effects average
 out.)  This may continue (though possibly at a reduced amplitude) even after
 infinite warmup time.
<p>
<li>Set the HeNe tube current to its recommended value or adjust it to maximize
 power output.  I have found that the latter current is often <b>lower</b>
 than the manufacturer's current specifications.  With the latter technique,
 allow time for the power to stabilize after a small change.  For example,
 reducing the current by .5 mA may result in an immediate increase in output
 power of 5 percent, but this may settle back down and depending on where on
 the curve you are, may end up lower or higher than the original setting.
</ol>

Once the laser has warmed up, you are ready to take a reading.  Where the
power is varying due to mode cycling, unless you have a data acquisition
system and data processing software, the best I can suggest is to eyeball the
max, min, or average value of the readings as desired.  This really isn't too
difficult. :)
<p>
A silicon photodiode or solar cell based power meter is quite linear with
respect to laser beam power.  For maximum accuracy, subtract or zero out the
dark current (with the sensor covered) and locate the sensor far enough from
the laser output aperture to minimize pickup of the glow of the discharge
(though neither of these is a serious source of error unless you are measuring
in the microwatt range).
<ul>
<li>If calibrated with an HeNe laser of known output power, absolute accuracy
 can easily be better than 5 percent even for a power meter using the
 photodiode from a discarded computer mouse or solar cell from Radio Shack! :)
<p>
<li>If a calibration reference is not available, using a conversion factor of
 0.42 mA/mW won't lead you too far astray.  That value appears to be fairly
 accurate for the photodiode array from an old Mouse Systems optical mouse
 (the type with the red and IR LEDs shining out the bottom) and falls in
 between a couple of other detectors I've tried:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Photonics Detectors, Inc. part number PDB-V107 (3 mm x 6 mm): 0.41 mA/mW
   (about $2.00 from an electronics distributor like
 <A HREF="http://www.digikey.com/">DigiKey</A>).
<p>
 <li>Photodiode array from Mouse Systems optical mouse (1 mm x 3 mm):
  0.42 mA/mW (free).
<p>
 <li>Photodiode from IBM barcode scanner (2 mm x 2 mm): 0.43 mA/mW (free).
 </ul>
 Other silicon sensors may have somewhat different sensitivities but they
 are still likely to fall between 0.40 and 0.45 mA/mW at 632.8 nm.
</ul>

For lasers of other wavelengths, sensitivity may be quite different.  For
example, based on the <A HREF="sipdresp.gif">Typical Silicon Photodiode
Spectral Response</A>, it may be 50 percent or more <i>lower</i> at 488 nm
from an argon ion laser.  For near-IR, silicon photodiodes will probably have
a somewhat <i>higher</i> sensitivity which then drops off but is still usable
beyond 1,064 nm.  However, the exact response curve is dependent on many
factors so the power meter really needs to be calibrated for each wavelength.

<h3><A NAME="htrnrtt">Testing of Non-Red HeNe Lasers</A></h3>

HeNe lasers producing yellow (594.1 nm), orange (611.9 nm), or green
(543.5 nm) beams are much more finicky with respect to <b>everything!</b>
This is due to the fact that the gain for these lines is much lower than that
at the common red (632.8 nm) wavelength.  Power supply current, mirror
alignment, and even the mounting of longer tubes, must be exactly right or
performance may be affected dramatically.
<p>
For visible non-red HeNe lasers:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Operating current</b> - The range over which a non-red HeNe tube will
 output any sort of beam may be much narrower.  Thus, an adjustable power
 supply (or adjustable ballast resistance where the power supply is not
 regulated) is recommended when setting up one of these.  Just using
 any old power supply brick may result in poor performance or no output at
 all.
<p>
<li><b>Mirror alignment</b> - Drift in alignment which would only reduce the
 output of a red HeNe laser by 25 percent could conceivably result in nothing
 at all from a non-red HeNe tube.  Thus, checking mirror alignment when a
 non-red HeNe laser head or tube is acquired is prudent.  I routinely do this
 even for red HeNe lasers and have often found substantial errors even for
 supposedly properly adjusted lasers.
<p>
<li><b>Mounting location</b> - For longer tubes in particular, the points
 where they are attached to the laser head may affect power output due to
 distortion of the glass envelope and bore.  The manufacturer usually
 recommends a two point mounting, typically near each end of the glass
 of the tube.  This is probably where it was set up in the factory as well
 and is therefore likely best for actual use.
</ul>
<p>
HeNe lasers producing IR (1,152.3 nm, 1,523.1 nm, or 3,391.3 nm) shouldn't be
nearly as critical, at least with respect to losing the beam entirely, as
these have much higher gain than red tubes.  However, power output and beam
quality could still suffer where the conditions are not optimal.
<p>
For more information, see the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A> and
the chapter: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpstoc">HeNe Laser Power Supplies</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrimhl">Identifying the Manufacturer of a HeNe Laser
 Tube</A></h3>

For the most part, this is a curiosity thing.  The future of the Universe
won't be affected if you don't know who made your HeNe tube.  However, it is
sometimes useful to be able to identify the specific model and knowing the
maker can help so the dimensions and style can be matched to a catalog
or database entry.
<p>
Some physical characteristics of HeNe tubes from various manufacturers are
summarized below.  Except for Melles Griot, this is from a rather limited
sample so just use it as starting point.  Unless otherwise noted, mirror
mounts are the common 'you bend it' type.  Some specific models - usually
old, long, or other (than red) color tubes may have actual three-screw
adjusters (not locking collars but permanently attached versions of the
type shown in <A HREF="mntadj.gif">Typical HeNe Tube with Three-Screw
Adjusters Added</A>).  Really old tubes will have mirrors Epoxied to
fixed glass or metal mounts with no possibility of adjustment (though
for those with exposed bores such as many Spectra-Physics models, very
slight distortion of the glass will affect alignment though it's hard
to devise a way of stabilizing any improvement.
<p>
In the summaries below, where the HeNe product line of a company has been
acquired by some other manufacturer, the original company's name is listed
first since that's the one you're likely to see with respect to surplus lasers.
<p>
The tubes from the following manufacturers are really very similar in terms
of overall design (though I would assume that company proprietary details vary
significantly).  Most of the descriptive details are simply here for
curiosity purposes and to help identify a totally unmarked laser.
See <A HREF="headhene.gif">Typical HeNe Laser Head</A> for
an example of this tube construction and its mounting in a cylindrical laser
head.  Tubes using the mirror mounts for both power supply connections are by
far the most common for modern internal mirror HeNe lasers:
<p>
<b>HeNe laser tubes of conventional design</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b><A HREF="http://lasers.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A></b> is
 probably the only remaining really large manufacturer of HeNe lasers.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>General construction:</b> For all but the lowest cost tubes (mostly
  those less than 6 inches in length, though there are exceptions), the
  anode-end is rounded or tapered glass with a very small anode gas space
  inside the tube.  The cathode-end is a slightly convex metal plate.  The
  metal cap at the cathode-end is butt joined for the glass-to-metal seal.
  The cathode can is only 1/2 or less of the length of the tube for all but
  the smallest barcode scanner tubes.
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b> Metal cylinders of varying lengths with narrow
  region to allow adjustment.  The mirror sealing frit on Melles Griot tubes
  is a generous round bead and usually dull gray or tan.
  Most older non-barcode type tubes have
  three-screw locking collars installed on at least one end.
  These collars are also used for mirror alignment at the factory and the
  screws are then often sealed with red, blue, or gray Loctite(tm)
  or something similar, but they can usually be freed if field realignment
  is needed.  Where locking collars can be installed, the gap in the
  restricted region of the mirror mount is quite wide - around 1/8th of an
  inch.  As a cost reduction or perhaps as a result of years of experience
  showing that the mirrors tend to walk off on their own with locking collars,
  many if not all of Melles Griot's newer tubes have a narrow restricted region
  and don't accept the normal locking collars - maybe there is a special
  version with narrow tip set-screws.
<p>
 <li><b>Electrical connections:</b> The positive connection from the ballast
  resistor(s) is to the anode-end mirror mount.  The negative connection is
  to the cathode-end mirror mount or exhaust tip-off.
<p>
  Melles Griot Laser heads generally have a start tape that runs from the
  anode along the side of the tube almost to the cathode end-cap, insulated
  with Mylar.  (It's actually a coating on the inner side of the Mylar.)
  There is supposed to be a benefit in shortening the starting time.
  Statisticians can apparently detect this but I've never seen any obvious
  improvement and sometimes these end up shorting out or at least having
  enough electrical leakage due to moisture to prevent starting!
<p>
 <li><b>Getter:</b> Except for some very short tubes, all include a ring shaped
  getter electrode with no visible getter spot.
<p>
  <li><b>Examples:</b>  See: <A HREF="tube1hen.jpg">Typical
  Small to Medium Size Melles Griot HeNe Laser Tubes</A>,
  <A HREF="headhene.gif">Typical HeNe Laser Head (Melles Griot)</A>, and
  <A HREF="3slcmg1.jpg">Three-Screw Locking Collars on Melles Griot HeNe
  Laser Tubes</A>.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Aerotech</b> (acquired by Melles Griot, these HeNe lasers are no
 longer being manufactured as far as I know).  All except the very oldest
 are generally similar to Melles Griot, Uniphase, and other modern hard-sealed
 tubes.  The old ones from around 1980 or earlier were all glass with
 terminals at one end and Epoxy seals.  Polarized lasers used a one-Brewster
 tube with a separate chamber that had the OC mirror attached to the end -
 either pre-aligned and glued, or on an adjustable mount.  Some even had
 tubes with two-Brewster windows and two such chambers.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htratls4">Aerotech LS4P HeNe Laser Tube - No Lasing</A>.
 Even older ones used side-arm tubes with similar construction.
<p>
 The following applies to the modern tubes:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>General construction:</b> Larger tubes have tapered glass
  anode-end and metal cap at cathode-end.  Small to medium size Aerotech tubes
  have metal end-caps at both ends.  Large cup-shaped anode gas space but
  otherwise quite similar to Melles Griot designs.
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b>  Metal cylinders of varying lengths with narrow
  region to allow adjustment.  The mirror sealing frit on Aerotech tubes
  may be a minimal bead and usually dark green or black.
<p>
 <li><b>Electrical connections:</b> The positive connection from the ballast
  resistor(s) is to the anode-end mirror mount.  The negative connection is
  to the cathode-end mirror mount or exhaust tip-off.
<p>
 <li><b>Getter:</b> Older Aerotech tubes always had getter electrodes with
  either a metallic (probably barium) getter spot or one that is clear.
  Some newer ones, at least, don't have any getter.
<p>
 <li><b>Examples:</b> See <A HREF="tubehene.gif">Typical HeNe Laser Tube
  Structure and Connections</A> for a diagram that approximates an Aerotech
  mid-size tube (however, there may not be any getter electrode).
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b><A HREF="http://www.cohr.com/">Coherent</A></b> -
 Modern Coherent-labeled lasers are manufactured by
 Melles Griot and most have identical specifications but with Coherent
 model numbers.  And, as of mid-2010, Coherent no longer even sells
 rebadged Melles Griot HeNe lasers!
<p>
<li><b>Siemens</b> (now <A HREF="http://www.lasos.com/">LASOS</A>).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>General construction:</b> For all but the smallest tubes, these have
  dome shaped metal caps at both ends with a flat very small anode gas space.
  The glass tube overlaps the edge of the end-caps in the glass-to-metal seal.
  The cathode can is only 1/2 or less of the length of the tube on longer
  tubes.  Very small barcode scanner tubes may have a long cathode can
  and use frit for the end-cap seals..
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b> Metal cylinders of varying lengths with narrow
  region to allow adjustment.  The mirror sealing frit on Siemens tubes
  may be a generous quarter-round bead and usually shiny gray.
<p>
 <li><b>Electrical connections:</b> The positive connection from the ballast
  resistor(s) is to the anode-end mirror mount.  The negative connection is
  to the cathode-end mirror mount or exhaust tip-off.
<p>
 <li><b>Getter:</b> One or more square textured flat getter electrodes
  (depending on tube length) with no visible getter spots.
<p>
 <li><b>Example:</b>  See <A HREF="si7641.jpg">Siemens LGR-7641 HeNe

<p>
<li><b>Spectra-Physics</b> (now <A HREF="http://www.newport.com/">Newport</A>,
 no longer appears to manufacture any HeNe lasers except for one
 frequency/intensity stabilized model - and that now uses a Melles
 Griot tube!).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>General construction:</b> All have a heavy glass walled tube
  overlapping flat metal end-caps at both ends.  Funnel-shaped anode gas
  space.  Cathode can 1/2 or less of the length of the tube for larger
  tubes.
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b> Most have metal cylinders of varying lengths with
  narrow region to allow adjustment.  Some larger Spectra-Physics HeNe laser
  tubes have a three-screw mirror adjuster attached or part of the mirror
  mount at one end.  The mirror sealing frit on Spectra-Physics tubes may
  be a small round-ish bead and dark green or black.
<p>
 <li><b>Electrical connections:</b> The positive connection from the ballast
  resistor(s) is to the anode-end mirror mount.  The negative connection is
  to the cathode-end mirror mount or exhaust tip-off.
<p>
 <li><b>Getter:</b> Ring-shaped getter electrode and visible
  getter spot may be present on older tubes, missing on newer ones.
<p>
 <li><b>Examples:</b> An older Spectra-Physics soft-seal HeNe tube is
  shown in <A HREF="sp084-1.gif">Spectra-Physics Model 084-1 HeNe Laser

  similar to modern Spectra-Physics HeNe barcode scanner tubes like

<p>
<li><b><A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A></b>.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>General construction:</b> Longer barcode scanner tubes tend to be
  narrower than other manufacturers.  Funnel-shaped anode gas space with
  metal end-caps butt joined at both ends with glass-to-metal seals.
  Higher power Uniphase tubes which fit into normal 1.75" diameter head
  cylinders still have metal end-caps at both ends.  But the one at the
  anode-end may be smaller and join to a short length of narrower glass
  tubing, sort of like a 1 inch length of 1 inch diameter barcode scanner
  tube transplanted onto that end.
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b> Metal cylinders of varying lengths with narrow
  region to allow adjustment.  The mirror sealing frit on Uniphase tubes
  may be a minimal bead and often shiny black.  The mirror mount stems on
  the cheapest short barcode scanner tubes may not have the normal narrow
  region for adjustment in the cylindrical mirror mount stem, but have it
  between the stem and metal end-cap.
<p>
 <li><b>Electrical connections:</b> The positive connection from the ballast

 since that's where they spent their former life. :)
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><li><b>General construction:</b> Overall similar to barcode scanner
  tubes in basic structure in having metal end-caps with mirror mounts at
  both ends joined by glass-to-metal seals that are slightly smaller in
  diameter than the main tube.  However, what seems to be unique about
  the Zygo design is that the cathode is not a separate aluminum cylinder
  as with most others, but is actually evaporatively coated on the inside
  surface of the glass over about half the tube length.  So, it looks like
  one huge getter spot. :)  (No separate getter is visible.)  These are long
  life tubes with ratings of 20,000 hours for the smallest (between 4 and 5
  inches in length) and 50,000 hours for the large ones (around 10 inches in
  length).
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b> Metal cylinders with narrow region to allow
  adjustment.  The mirror sealing frit on Zygo tubes may be a minimal

<p>
Linearly polarized versions of some internal mirror laser tube
models are available which add a plate at
the Brewster angle inside the laser tube, usually near the HR mirror.  A few
are also available with one or two Brewster windows or 0 degree
(perpendicular) AR coated windows instead of mirrors.
<p>
The smallest Melles Griot, Siemens, Uniphase, and Spectra-Physics HeNe laser
tubes are all similar.  Typical examples are shown in
<A HREF="ici1mgt.gif">Small Melles Griot HeNe
Tube</A> and <A HREF="uphltex.jpg">Uniphase HeNe Laser Tube with External
Lens</A>, the latter being a normal tube with a negative lens glued to its OC
(removed by soaking the end of the tube in acetone overnight) to increase its
divergence for the barcode scanner application (a second positive lens about
4 inches away was used to recollimate the beam.
<p>
And now for the trivia question of the month: Why do most HeNe laser tubes
of conventional construction with metal mirror mounts have their output at
the cathode end of the tube?  Likely answer: Because then the high voltage
doesn't need to run the length of the laser head cylinder with the hot but
well insulated ballast resistance squashed in there somehow and the high
voltage attracting dust and inviting shocking experiences when cleaning.
So far so good.  But then why do many, if not the
majority, of barcode scanner HeNe laser tubes have anode-end output?  Other
than to be shocking and annoying, there really can't be any imaginable
practical reason for this, right? (There is a very minor advantage in
having the output be at the anode end of the tube under some conditions
to maximize the overlap of the intracavity beam and the lasing mode volume
of the hemispherical resonator that may be used, but this would only be of
any minimal consequence with low gain "other color" HeNe lasers, and not
for low power red ones.)  Apparently, there are many answers to this
question, probably more depending on the audience than any scientific
justification. :)
<p>
<b>HeNe laser tubes of more interestng but oddball design</b>
<p>
The following are include some tubes based on slightly different architectures:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hughes</b> (some models are still manufactured by Melles Griot
 and the design hasn't changed significantly since 1979).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>General construction:</b> Except for the mirror mounts which are
  made of metal on newer tubes, the rest is of all glass construction.
  The capillary runs nearly the full distance between the mirror
  mounts (compared to the previous designs where it must remain at least 1
  radius to 1 diameter away at the cathode-end).  The cathode also usually
  runs most of the length of the tube.  In the true Hughes design, there will
  also be a short tube surrounding the capillary near its end.  A side-hole in
  this tube channels the cathode discharge.
<p>
 <li><b>Mirror mounts:</b> On newer Hughes tubes, these are the traditional
  metal cylinders of varying lengths with narrow region to allow adjustment.
  But they are attached to the glass structure with glass-to-metal seals.
  The mirror mounts may include 3-screw adjusters at one or both ends.  The
  screws face towards the tube and are thus easily accessible once the end-cap
  is removed.  The mirror sealing frit on Hughes tubes may be a generous round
  bead and usually dull gray or tan.
<p>
 <li><b>Electrical connections:</b> The anode and cathode electrical
  connections are all made at the non-output end of the tube.  The cathode
  is via a separate terminal pin while the anode will either be the mirror
  mount at the same end of the tube or to its own pin.
<p>
  Laser heads generally have an additional start wire from the positive HV
  supply bypassing the ballast resistance that wraps around the glass
  enclosing the bore at the terminal-end of the tube.  Like the Melles Griot
  lasers, this supposedly reduces starting time.  Although I have not seen
  an obvious benefit, I would tend to believe it more with the Hughes design
  since the HV comes up faster on before the ballast resistance and where
  the wire wraps around is more optimal, being near the bore.
<p>
  A common mistake with Hughes-style tubes
  is to attach the PSU negative voltage to the mirror mount
  at the opposite end from the terminals instead of its terminal pin.  The tube
  will lase but damage will result if left running this way due to heating and
  sputtering at the mirror mount attached to the negative lead of the PSU now
  being used as the cathode.  If the anode connection is attached
  to the cathode-end mirror mount, the discharge will bypass the bore, there
  will be no lasing, and the power supply or ballast resistor may be damaged.
<p>
 <li><b>Getter:</b> There may be a ring-shaped getter electrode with or
  without a visible getter spot.  (Small tubes may only have
  a half-ring.)
<p>
 <li><b>Examples:</b> See the diagram in <A HREF="hachene1.gif">Hughes Style
  HeNe Laser Tube</A> and photo in <A HREF="hachene2.jpg">Hughes 3227-HPC HeNe
  Laser Tube</A>.
 </ul>
<p>
 There are only two advantages to the Hughes style design that I can see: (1)
 The 'all connections at one end' construction may be required in certain
 retrofit or replacement situations and (2) since the actual length of the
 capillary can be somewhat longer for a given tube size, slightly higher
 power may be possible.  However, Hughes style tubes would seem to be more
 complex and expensive to manufacture as well as being more fragile, which
 is probably why you won't see many new instances of this construction.
<p>
 One (and probably two) Brewster tubes are also available.  A few linearly
 polarized Hughes HeNe tubes may actually be one-Brewster tubes with an
 external OC mirror fastened to the end of the tube.  I've only seen one
 example of this so may never have been common.  Even a Hughes laser head
 from 1979 used the modern internal Brewster plate construction.
<p>
<li><b>NEC</b> (now <A HREF="http://www.soc-ltd.co.jp/en/">SOC</A>) -
 Very similar to Hughes with all wiring at one end
 of tube as shown in <A HREF="nechene1.gif">NEC Style HeNe Laser Tube</A>.
 Toshiba and Hitachi HeNe laser tubes are also similar.
 If installed in a laser head,
 the connections (and possibly the ballast resistor) will likely be covered
 with a molded in-place rubber insulator.
<p>
<li><b>PMS/REO</b> (now <A HREF="http://www.reoinc.com/">REO</A>) -
 Somewhat similar to Hughes and NEC but their envelope is mostly of heavy
 metal construction, probably to improve thermal control and dimensional
 stability.  There is an aluminum sleeve to serve as the cathode internally.
 These tubes are generally considered to be of very high quality but this is
 mostly due to the performance of the optics - mirror(s) and/or window(s).
 The glasswork at the anode-end and bore are somewhat to very fragile.
 (About half of the PMS/REO tubes I've seen have been broken.)  The only
 tunable HeNe laser currently sold commercially uses a one-Brewster tube
 of this type.  See: <A HREF="pms1b1.jpg">PMS One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube</A>.
 PMS/REO internal mirror HeNe laser tubes look similar but have a normal metal
 mirror mount instead of the Brewster window.  Even some very low power REO
 tubes have similar (and no doubt very expensive) construction as shown in
 <A HREF="reolpt1.jpg">REO 0.8 mW HeNe Laser Tube</A>.
 Some older and/or "other color"
 tubes also include a heater coil surrounding the mirror mount at the
 metal-end of the tube supposedly to eliminate "color centers" which may
 be created in the mirror coatings from UV in the bore light.  Newer mirror
 coatings are probably immune to this malady.
<p>
 There is no visible getter nor any means of activating a hidden getter
 (unless the metal cylinder must be heated with a blow torch
 or induction furnace!) and many or most of the PMS/REO Brewster tubes are 
 soft-seal.  However, though the gas may become contaminated with a
 sickly pinkish discharge after sitting idle for months or even years,
 they do tend to clean up well by extended run time if originally healthy
 (not near end-of-life).  Internal mirror PMS/REO tubes are frit-sealed so
 this is not an issue.
<p>
 One peculiarity that seems to be unique to PMS/REO tubes is that when
 the gas is contaminated, the discharge may exhibit swirling white streamers
 visible (by looking down the end of the tube) between the bore and inside
 of the cylinder, somewhat similar to a plasma globe effect.  These will go
 away once the gas cleans up.
<p>
 Another effect that I've only observed with one REO tube was that changing
 the arrangement of IR suppression magnets near the cathode resulted in
 a power decline over several hours until the magnets were removed completely,
 at which time the power gradually came back, eventually to a near-new
 level.  My hypothesis is that the change in magnetic field moved the
 diffuse discharge between the bore and cathode to a different location on
 the cathode altering where the gettering and heating was taking place.
 So, old trapped gas was released and then re-gettered.  Or something. :)
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Carl Zeiss:</b> I've never actually seen a Zeiss HeNe laser in person,
 but from a (probably old) brochure, they appear to be of a vareity of styles
 including designs similar to Spectra-Physics or Uniphase barcode scanner
 tubes with metal end-caps, Hughes all glass tubes, and Spectra-Physics
 side-arm tubes (for longer lasers).
</ul>
<p>
Really old HeNe soft-seal tubes are often more along the lines of the Hughes
style.  Spectra-Physics (mostly older and non-barcode scanner)
HeNe tubes generally put the cathode in a side-arm with the bore exposed.
This makes sense for laboratory lasers where magnets and such are required
to be close to the discharge but is an awkward bulky fragile design for
small tubes.  Older large Aerotech tubes had a
side-arm for the cathode only, with the remainder of the tube being
of conventional design with a large gas reservoir.  Really old tubes might
have side-arms for both cathode and anode.  Older tubes of from various
manufacturers were also more likely to have an adjustable mirror mount
at one end at least.
<p>
Some additional information, photos, and diagrams may be found in
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage Lasers and
Accessories Brochures</A> with actual examples of many of these in the
<A HREF="laserpic/">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> under
"Photos of Assorted Helium-Neon Lasers".
<p>
And, I'm sure there are all sorts of exceptions and a HeNe tube may appear
in style to a particular manufacturer but could have some other origin (like
a foreign clone).  In other words, your mileage may vary. :)

<h2>Internal Mirror HeNe Tube Optics</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htrcno0">Cleaning HeNe Laser Optics</A></h3>

Fortunately, this is almost a non-issue for internal mirror HeNe tubes as
there is only one accessible surface that matters and it is only in the output
beam - not part of the laser resonator.  Thus, no amount of gunk or dirk on
its surface can affect laser action in any detectable way.  However, if it is
not clean, the output beam may become diffused or distorted.  And, eventually
the Anti-Reflection (AR) coating and the surface of the glass itself may be
etched permanently by finger oils which turn acidic and/or damaged by gritty
dirt.  Of course, there may be external optical components like lenses,
mirrors, and prisms that need to be cleaned and could also be damaged from
abuse or neglect.
<p>
Those who maintain lasers professionally will insist on the use of laboratory
(gas chromatograph or spectroscopic) grade methanol and acetone.  For small
internal mirror HeNe laser tubes and their optics, this really isn't necessary.
The type of isopropyl alcohol sold in drug stores designated medicinal (91%) is
quite acceptable but you will have to gently dry off the cleaned surface - the
impurities will result in a cloudy film if just allowed to dry.  Even rubbing
alcohol (70 percent) will work in a pinch.  However, if you are cleaning the
mirrors of an external mirror laser, see the section:
<A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrcln">Cleaning of Laser Optics</A>.
<p>
The surfaces of Brewster windows are somewhat sturdier than mirror coatings
but without knowing the precise material, assume they are still relatively
soft.  When cleaning a Brewster window with the tube powered and aligned
(e.g., there is an intra-cavity beam), my criteria for 'clean' is when the
scatter off the outside surface is less than or equal to the scatter off the
inside (inaccessible) surface.  (Scatter here means the fuzzy spot of light
appearing on the surface, not the actual reflection.)  Unless the tube is
damaged or defective, the inside surface should be about as clean as possible!
<p>
Lens tissue is best, Q-tips (cotton swabs) will work.  They should be wet but
not dripping.  Be gentle - the glass and particularly the AR coating on the
output mirror surface (and other optics) is soft.  Wipe (don't press!) in one
direction only - don't rub.  Also, do not dip the tissue or swab back into the
bottle of alcohol after cleaning the optics as this may contaminate it.  The
alcohol should be all you need in most cases but some materials will respond
better to acetone or just plain water.  Just blowing on the surface so it fogs
and wiping <i>very</i> gently may help to rid it of the last traces of residue
from the alcohol.  (Unless you have spectroscopic grade solvents, this latter
method is probably best for clearing the dust that invariably settles on
the surfaces of glass optics and Brewster windows after a short time, even
when exposed to a clean environment.)
<p>
Note 1: The purity of medicinal and rubbing alcohol would appear to vary quite
a bit.  Some cheap brands are apparently only water and isopropyl alcohol
while high priced ones may contain ingredients that will cloud your optics.
You may have to try a few before finding one that is fairly pure - or just
go for the real stuff. :)
<p>
Note 2: The adhesive useed to attach the cotton to the Q-tip stick is probably
soluble in acetone and perhaps alcohol.  Some of it will then go into solution
to collect on your optics.  Thus, a Q-tip wet with solvent should be used
quickly and only once before being discarded.
<p>
For red (632.8 nm) HeNe lasers, the exterior AR coated OC mirror surface
should generally be a uniform blue or purple color when clean.  However, I
have seen at least one that was greenish.  The AR coating on lasers of other
wavelengths will likely differ in color, but it may not be obvious, especially
for IR (or UV) lasers.  About the only thing that can be said for sure is that
the color of the faint reflection from the AR coated surface shouldn't include
much of the lasing color.  And, high quality broad-band AR coatings may come
very close to being invisible!
<p>
CAUTION: Don't overdo it - optical components may be bonded or mounted using
adhesives that are soluble in alcohol or acetone (but probably not water).
Too much and the whole thing could become unglued.  I still haven't found the
itty-bitty collimating lens I lost in this manner. :-(  In addition, any
plastic optics may be totally ruined by even momentary contact with strong
solvents.
<p>
And, about keeping the inner surfaces of those mirrors clean.  You say:
"I can't even get to them, being sealed inside the tube.  What are you talking
about?".  Well, while the environment inside the HeNe tube should free of
contamination, there can always be little particles of unidentified 'stuff'
left over from the manufacturing process.  So, while there are generally no
restrictions on the orientation of these tubes, it is probably not a bad idea
for them to be stored and installed horizontally if possible so none of that
'stuff' can fall on the mirrors.  This might be excessive caution but it is
usually quite easy and painless.

<h3><A NAME="htrcno1">Why You Shouldn't Touch the Mirrors or Mirror
 Mounts</A></h3>

The laser resonator for internal mirror plasma tubes is totally sealed safely
inside.  However, there are still some very good reasons to avoid touching
the output coupler or pressing on the mirrors and their mounts.  Some
comments:

<ul>
<li>The outer surface of the Output Coupler (OC) uses an Anti-Reflection
 (AR) coated mirror and putting your grubby finger prints on it will definitely
 mess up the quality of the beam coming out.  Eventually, the finger oils,
 acid, dirt, grit, and bicycle grease will etch or otherwise affect the optical
 quality of the surface and AR coating.
<p>
<li>The outer surface of the High Reflector (HR) usually doesn't pass any beam
 that matters so it isn't as critical unless you are using the low power beam
 from that end for optical feedback or something like that - in which case it
 is quite critical due to the low power of the beam exiting from that end of
 the tube.
</ul>

If you accidentally touch either mirror, carefully clean it, preferably with
lens tissue and alcohol.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrcno0">Cleaning HeNe Laser Optics</A>

<ul>
<li>Excessive pressure on either mirror mount may result in problems with
 mirror alignment but for most tubes, you would really have to work at this to
 have any effect.  And, where there are adjustment screws of any kind, don't
 be tempted to tighten them up. :)  If they appear loose, just touching them
 could mess up alignment.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>.
<p>
<li>Of course, if the tube is powered, the mirror mounts carry the high voltage
 and high voltage return.
 <ul>
 <p>
 <li>If the cathode is earth grounded, it would be safe to touch - at least you
   won't get a shock.
 <p>
 <li>You definitely don't want to touch the anode if the cathode is earth
   grounded.  Even if the entire affair is floating or powered via an isolation
   transformer, it is likely that the tube will go out due to the momentary
   change in capacitance as you touch it and then will attempt to restart.
   You will then likely get zapped by the starting voltage to your body
   capacitance - no matter how non-magnetic your personality may be! :-)
 <p>
 </ul>
 Interestingly (and I definitely DON'T recommend this), touching the anode of
 one of those little bar code scanner power supplies like the one described in
 the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic1">HeNe Inverter Power Supply Using
 PWM Controller IC (IC-HI1)</A> (well actually, precisely that one), resulted
 in only a mild tingle - and the smell of burning flesh. :-(  Its maximum
 current is only 3 or 4 mA which is unpleasant but not really likely to be
 particularly dangerous.  Then again, your body may react in unpredictable ways
 like throwing the entire affair across the room!
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrmdim">Damage to Mirror Coatings of Internal Mirror Laser
 Tubes</A></h3>

There are two ways the inside surface of the mirrors can be damaged on internal
mirror lasers: by having "stuff" land on top of them or by having the original
dielectric coatings come off.  (Of course, the AR coating on the outer surface
of the OC mirror can be damaged by overzealous cleaning or other abuse.)

<h4><A NAME="htrsadm">Sputtering Overcoat or Debris on Mirrors</A></h4>

The most likely cause of damage to inner surface of the HR or OC mirror on
internal mirror HeNe lasers is due to sputtering as a result of running the
tube with reverse polarity for an extended period of time.  Where the anode
mirror mount is used as the cathode, sputtering of the metal will actually
deposit a nice metallic film on the mirror in close proximity to it.  After
only a few minutes, the power will drop and lasing will eventually cease
entirely.  After 30 minutes, the coating may be so thick that the mirror will
appear opaque.  (For an "other color" tube, particularly yellow and green, it
may take only a few seconds to ruin the tube due to the low gain.)  Note that
strictly speaking, the coatings aren't actually
damaged, just covered.  So, a suitable acid wash or something might restore
them to pristine condition.  Unfortunately, this is tough to do on a sealed
tube but might be possible if you salvage the mirrors for some other laser
project. :)
<p>
Apparently, the careful use of reverse polarity may actually be used by some
manufacturers to 'tune' the power output of a HeNe tube.  This might be
needed to reduce the gain of a 'hot' tube that is lasing on an adjacent
spectral line in addition to the desired one.  However, I can't imagine any
hobbyist wanting to ruin a perfectly peculiar tube of this type or to want to
<i>reduce</i> output power on any laser! :)
<p>
There are two ways for reverse polarity to occur depending on the
style of the HeNe tube.  However, they are both due to carelessness or lack
of knowledge:
<p>
<ol>
<li>HeNe tubes where the cathode connection is to the cathode-end mirror
 mount (e.g, the most common types) - In this case, accidentally reversing
 the power supply leads will do it.
<p>
<li>HeNe tubes where all connections are to terminals at the anode-end
 (Hughes style) rather than to the mirror mounts - It is easy to not realize
 or forget that the cathode-end mirror mount isn't supposed to be connected
 at all since there is a separate terminal via a glass feed-through for the
 cathode connection at the <b>anode-end</b> of the tube.  I've done this a
 couple of times but caught it before detectable damaged occurred.
</ol>
<p>
As noted elsewhere, the HeNe tube will appear to operate normally - perhaps
it will be even easier to start - but degradation will happen in short order
and at that point, your options are quite limited - as in there are none.
<p>
Of course, running a tube on AC will do the same thing and an autopsy of
one that had died in this manner showed a clear indication of a dark overcoat
on the HR mirror, though it wasn't obvious from external examination.
<p>
A drop in power even with correct polarity and current over the course of
several hours may also be a result of sputtering but of the actual cathode
electrode once it has lost its "pickling".  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt5">HeNe Tube Seals and Lifetime</A>.  There is
nothing that can be done for this either.  However, check for other causes
like mirror alignment and improper power supply current before giving up.
<p>
A metallic coating on the inside of the glass anywhere in the tube except
near the getter may be an indication that sputtering has occurred.  For
example, Melles Griot HeNe tube cathodes typically have several holes around
their perimeter near the end cap/mirror mount.  Metallic spots on the glass
at these holes are a definitive confirmation of sputtering and likely means
end-of-life.
<p>
Running the tube with grossly excessive current (perhaps 2X optimal ormore)
may also result in sputtering damage though other things will likely die
first like the ballast resistor(s) or power supply.
<p>
In rare cases, a bit of debris may find its way to a most inappropriate
spot in the center of one of the mirrors.  Despite clean-room assembly,
foreign objects can find their way inside HeNe tubes!  This is why I
recommend storing and using laser tubes on their side, not vertically!).
A speck of dust in exactly the wrong place can result in an interesting,
though perhaps useless, multimode beam. :)  Sometimes, careful tapping will
remedy the situation.  I don't know if other more drastic measures (like
blasting with a YAG laser) have a reasonable chance of success

<h4><A NAME="htrmcv">Mirror Coating Vanishes</A></h4>

This is a problem I guarantee you won't see everyday, at least not on internal
mirror laser tubes.  No, I'm not referring to sputtered electrode material or
other debris on the mirror but something rather strange. :)
<p>
I was sent a HeNe tube with a hole in the Output Coupler (OC) mirror.  OK,
it isn't quite a hole in the glass, but the dielectric coating on its inside
surface is completely obliterated - as though someone had gone in there with
abrasive and removed it - wiped it clean (a beautiful job, I might add!) -
but only in the central area (slightly larger than the diameter of the
actual bore, about equal to the diameter of the inside of the restricted
area of the mirror mount - a coincidence?).  And, the Anti-Reflection (AR)
coating which is apparently placed under the mirror coating is totally
intact (at least that's what it appears to be - there is about the same
reflection from the inner surface and the AR coated outer surface).
<p>
I have to say that this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen in some time.
(Note that damage to external mirrors, even flaking, isn't particularly
unusual depending on the storage conditions or prior cleaning attempts but
such damage to internal mirrors is unusual.  The second weirdest thing would
be that HeNe tube where the discharge changes color from anode to cathode.
See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhldc">HeNe Tube Lases but Color of
Discharge Changes Along Length of Bore</A>.)  I can't imagine that this effect
was a result of natural causes and consider any internal cause to be highly
unlikely in any case.  The discharge looks normal and the operating voltage
is normal similar to that of other identical model tubes.  The only
conceivable explanation from within is that it was run with excessive current
for an extended period of time somehow resulting in ion bombardment (inverse
sputtering? - see below for some additional info) of the OC mirror which is at
the cathode-end of the tube.  I don't even know if this is theoretically
possible.  Since the HR mirror at the anode-end of the tube is in perfect
condition, it isn't likely to be an internal optical effect either (too great
a light flux in the resonator) since I would think that would do the same
thing at both ends.  The fact that the diameter of the clear area is
significantly larger than the bore also precludes this possibility.
<p>
Total reflection from the inner and outer surfaces of the OC in the area of 
the hole is about 2 percent which is too bad.  I'd love to try to use this
tube with an external OC mirror.  However, the total single pass gain of a
tube of this length is also only around 2 percent so there would probably be
insufficient gain to sustain oscillations.  At best, it would be marginal.
I initially made a half-hearted attempt to get it to lase anyhow but nothing
happened.  Later, I did a more careful test with some success - see below.
<p>
I've never ever seen a HeNe tube with <i>any</i> internal damage to either
mirror before.  Thus, I'm inclined to suspect an external cause.  Maybe
someone was using it to align a high power Nd:YAG resonator and forgot to
remove the tube before firing up the big laser.  POW! No more mirror. :)
This, however, was denied by the former owner.  Other possibilities are that
the coating was of poor quality and flaked off on its own (though I could
find no evidence of any debris) or that this tube was used as part of
another high power and/or invisible laser for aiming purposes and the main
beam accidentally made its way back to the mirror by reflection from the
work-piece.
<p>
I am attempting to find out more about the history of this tube.  So far,
what I do know is that it was originally part of a Postal scanner of some
sort and was operational when removed from service.  At some point between
then and now, someone or something went in and did a thorough cleaning
job. :)
<p>
<b>FLASH</b> - Some new info: I just discovered that for at least the first 5
minutes of operation from a cold start, the negative discharge may decide to
originate inside the mirror mount rather than where it belongs at the
cathode.  And, it may abruptly switch back and forth at random times.
Whether this is due to a broken connection between the cathode and mirror
mount (unlikely), depletion of the cathode 'pickling', or that the warranty
has expired, I do not know.  So, the inverse sputtering theory is back in the
running even though it would seem more likely that this would more likely
result in a metal overcoat than removal of the mirror coating!
<p>
I have now taken some photos of this tube.  See
<A HREF="lhp120-1.jpg">Melles Griot 05-LHP-120 HeNe Laser Tube with
Missing OC Mirror Coating</A>.  The photo on the far left shows a normal
05-LHP-120 with the weird one sitting next to it.  The middle shot is of
the that one under power with the discharge to the cathode the way it is
supposed to be.  The photo on the far right shows the discharge taking place
to the OC mirror mount instead - probably due to a bad connection between it
and the aluminum cathode can.
<p>
As promised, I did some more experiments in getting the tube to lase with
an external mirror.  It now produces up to about 0.3 mW acting as a two part
resonator containing a low reflectance intermediate mirror.  With the
wiped-clean mirror properly aligned, the weak modes due to the slight
reflection from it (in the original tube) and the extended resonator formed
with the external mirror compete with one-another.  As the tube heats and
expands, the output comes and goes periodically.  Pressing gently on the
external mirror mount to adjust the length of the total cavity ever so
slightly results in very distinct power cycles - the classic behavior of an
interferometer.  A very cool toy if nothing else. :)  For more details on these
interesting experiments see the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnwtl">External
Mirror Laser Using HeNe Tube with Missing Mirror Coating</A>.
<p>
I have found a second tube with a similar electrical problem.  The
resulting sputtering has indeed overcoated the cathode-end mirror to the point
that there is no longer any laser output but the coating hasn't fallen off
yet. :) Unfortunately, the discharge doesn't remain inside the mirror mount
long enough to try the obvious experiment to see if its coating will eventually
flake off.
<p>
And I just came across a tube from an HP-5501A laser where there is a
(approximately) 1/2 mm hole in the coating at the exact center of the
mirror.  The HeNe laser power supply went bad and was pulsing the
tube continuously, possibly for hours before anyone noticed.  Like the
other tube with a similar problem, the only evidence is the missing spot
on the mirror coating.  The tube looks and behaves exactly as a normal
tube should, except that there is now no beam.
<p>
<A HREF="5501ax1.jpg">Hewlett Packard 5501A HeNe Laser Tube with Missing
Coating in Center of Output Mirror</A> shows the unsightly blemish.
It's actually fairly sharp edged but the digital camera didn't know how
to focus on it.  Another 5501A tube had a hole over 2 mm in diameter -
the size of the bore in the spacing rod directly against the mirror!
In <A HREF="5501ax2.jpg">Hewlett Packard 5501A HeNe Laser Tube Showing
Bore Discharge</A> it can be seen that the glow terminates well away from
the mirror when running normally.  I have no idea what happens during
repeated starting.  But by eye, there was no visible discharge near
the mirror.

<h4><A NAME="htrhltr1">HeNe Laser Torture 1</A></h4>

OK, send the kids to their rooms, put the dog and cat out in the
yard, and blindfold the tropical fish.  This is going to be ugly. :)
My objective is to see if I can blast a hole in the mirror coating
of a hapless certifiably dead HeNe laser tube using abuse that
may occur due to power supply/tube incompatibility, power supply
failure, or increase of tube dropout current due to high mileage.
<p>
My torture machine is a 12 VDC input HeNe laser power supply brick that
has lost its regulation ability, so it basically is controlled by the
input voltage, and is generally of little practical use except for these
"special applications".  If it is killed during these experiments, no one
will shed any big tears.
<p>
My experimental subject, err, victim #1, is a well used Hewlett Packard
05501-60006, the HeNe laser tube found in the 5501A two-frequency Zeeman
metrology laser.  This one probably has seen 50,000 hours, if not double
or more, of run time, and is now producing very close to 0.00 mW.  But it
still starts and runs normally.  The tube from the 5501A was selected
because (1) I already know that the missing mirror coating malady (MMCM)
is, if not common, at least not that unusual as can be seen in
<A HREF="5501ax1.jpg">Hewlett Packard 5501A HeNe Laser Tube with
Missing Coating in Center of Output Mirror</A>,
as I've seen at least two of these terminally sick
laser tubes.  And (2) I have a pile of dead ones and this
must be a noble use for one or two, before the organs are
harvested!  The 5501A lasers are typically run 24/7,
often unattended and simply idling away their photons not being used.
So, it's possible that rapid restarting or sputtering could be going on
for days or even weeks without anyone knowing.  The tube in the photo
above was in such a laser, though I don't know for how long it was
actually being pummeled.
<p>
The 136K ohm ballast resistance normally used with the 5501A tube is
replaced with a 20K ohm resistor, preceeded by a 3 nF, 15 kV capacitor.
The result is a reliable relaxation oscillator at low drive, though the tube
does seem to stay on continuously at higher power.  This produces pulses
which should have a peak current of 100 to 200 mA.  If the damage is done by
the peak current, then there should be sufficient abuse to produce
mirror damage, though it could still take a long time.  However, if
something like undershoot/reverse polarity or ringing
is required, that will necessitate a more complex device.
<p>
I started running this rig at an input voltage sufficient to produce
10 to 20 pulses per second into the laser tube.  Thats 10 to 20 starts
per second, which we are taught is supposed to be bad for tubes
and power supplies.  I intend to continue running like this for at least
24 hours, or until the mirror coating shows signs of disappearing.
So far, after a few hours, about the only thing that's changed
is that the output power at optimal current (run normally) has
increased from near 0 uW to about 60 uW.  However, I assume this
is simply a result of running the tube, not that I've discovered
some elixir of life for old lasers!  Even though these are supposedly
hard-seal tubes, some will respond to extended run time, possibly
dramatically.
<p>
My plan was that if after 24 hours, nothing bad happens, more extreme
measures would be implemented, like a larger capacitance or lower ballast
resistor or both.  However, it may take higher peak voltage to make
anything happen.  If this turns out to be the case, a hard-start tube
will be the next test subject. And, should the tube start outputting
rated power, I'll quit while I'm ahead. ;-)
<p>
And, not unexpectedly, it's been run at least 24 hours now and the only
change is that the output is over 120 uW when run at 3 mA.  It's somewhat
hard to tell what the exact power output is consistently because even
with the Zerodur bore determining the mirror spacing, there is still
some change with temperature, and output power is strongly dependent on
where on the gain curve it's lasing.  But since this tube works well
enough to try in a 5501A, torture operations on it have been canceled.
<p>
My next subject, Tube #2 also was brought in outputting exactly 0 mW,
but the complexion of its bore discharge seems a bit different, perhaps
more white-ish, which could a more terminal condition.  Pulsing it for
10 hours with a 100K ohm ballast resistance had no effect on either
output power or the mirror coating.  When I went to try use a lower
ballast of 20K ohms, it promptly blew up one of the 1 nF, 15 kV capacitors
making up the 3 nF energy storage capacitor bank.  Whether this is
due to an extremely high peak voltage due to a sometimes hard-to-start
tube, or the rapid dV/dt (seems unlikely), I don't know.  So, I built a
capacitor from two sheets of 0.02" thick FR4 unplated PCB material and
aluminum foil.  This worked out to about 9 nF and should be able to handle
any voltage the poor abused HeNe laser power supply brick is willing to
produce.  The bare wood table, chains and shackles setup can be seen in
<A HREF="henetm1.jpg">HeNe Laser Torture Machine 1</A>.  Without the
restraints, the tube would rip out the connections and attempt to excape. ;-)
It makes a satisfying snapping sound when it discharges through the tube.
This is probably the aluminum foil vibrating - some of which
is even visible where the foil isn't in firm contact with the FR4.  I also
tried eliminating the ballast resistor entirely resulting in discharge
flashes that were nearly white, but the constant screaming of the tube
from the pain was unbearable. :)  The 20K ohm 1 W resistor did eventually
get destroyed by the peak current, so I'm now using
a 5K ohm 10 W wirewound resistor that should survive, the discharge
is still somewhat orange, and there is only occadional moaning
from the tube.  I will be exercising the modified torture device
shortly.  However, it will likely not have any more of an effect
than the 3 nF setup unless an unfortunate bug wonders by.  I need
to figure out how to create a reliable undershoot.  A nice
high value inductor perhaps.....

<h2>Problems with Mirror Alignment</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htrmir0">Checking and Correcting Mirror Alignment of Internal
 Mirror Laser Tubes</A></h3>

Note: While written specifically with HeNe laser tubes in mind, the techniques
described in the following sections apply equally well to HeNe, Ar/Kr ion, and
other sealed laser tubes which have internal mirrors on compliant mounts
(those attached to the end-caps via narrow sections of ductile metal tubing).
<p>
Some (mostly older) HeNe and other internal mirrors tubes will actually have
adjustment screws as part of the tube assembly.  I'm not talking about the
locking collars found on many Melles Griot and some other tubes to stabilize
the mirrors.  See <A HREF="3slcmg1.jpg">Three-Screw Locking Collars on Melles
Griot HeNe Laser Tubes</A>.  These may be used for adjustment but are not
ideal for that purpose.  Rather, some tubes have actual
three-screw adjusters where the screws run parallel to the tube's axis and
press against an adjoining disk.  Selected models from Aerotech, Hughes, Melles
Griot, Spectra-Physics, and others have been found to have these.  Some like
those on certain surplus (Xerox) Spectra-Physics laser heads are quite large
with fine control of alignment.  If your tube is one of these - and its gas
fill is still good - the procedures below for mirror adjustment can be
considerably simplified.  No special tools will be needed and fine control
of mirror angle should be easy to achieve with just a tiny (WELL INSULATED!!)
hex wrench.  This sort of adjuster can often be added to a modern tube as well.
See <A HREF="mntadj.gif">Typical HeNe Tube with Three-Screw Adjusters Added</A>
for an example of one approach.
<p>
Precise mirror alignment is critical to proper functioning of HeNe tubes and
lasers in general.  For a HeNe tube, the mirrors must be aligned (parallel to
each other and perpendicular to the tube bore) to a pointing accuracy better
than one part in 1/10th of the ratio of bore diameter to resonator length to
achieve optimal performance.
<p>
For a typical HeNe tube, this is one part in 2,500.  If the alignment is off
by one part in 1,000 (1 miiliradian or 1 mR), there will likely be no output
at all.  You won't fix this by trial and error!  Spherical mirrors may have a
somewhat wider range where a beam will be produced but still require precise
alignment to achieve optimal performance.  Alignment (and nearly everything
else) is even more critical for HeNe tubes producing non-red (particularly
yellow and green) beams as these have much lower gain.  And for these, there
may be no way to obtain an optimal alignment if the tube is not inside a
thermally stabilized enclosure, or possibly at all.
<p>
I now routinely check mirror alignment on any HeNe laser heads or tubes I
acquire by gently pressing sideways on the mirror mount at the cathode
(grounded) end of the tube.  I may also do the basic "walking the mirror"
tests as described in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrwalk">Walking the
Mirrors in Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> which will identify tubes where
the alignment of both mirrors was never quite right (most likely when new from
the factory).  If I can increase power output by more than about 5 percent in
either case <b>after a 20 minute warmup</b>, I will adjust alignment as
described in subsequent sections, below.
<p>
Where a HeNe tube produces a weak or low quality beam or doesn't lase at all
and no other faults have been identified (such as improper operating current,
or problems with the gas fill), mirror misalignment is quite possible.
However, it does take effort to mess these up as the mirror mount tube(s) must
actually be bent.  Casual handling won't do it.  It would have had to be
dropped or used as a hammer! :)
<p>
Other possible causes of less than perfect mirror alignment include the
following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Repeated thermal cycles may result in annealing of stresses left in the
 mounts when they were originally aligned during tube manufacture.  Alignment
 of one or both mirrors may then drift slowly over the tube's lifetime.
 And these can be significant.  There may be compression on one side
 and tension on the other, especially if the initial bend was in only
 one direction, without any compensating smaller bend the other way,
 so nothing will be in equilibrium.  This is perhaps the dominent cause
 of misaligned mirrors on otherwise well treated tubes. :)  This is a
 fundamental flaw in laser tube designs using this type of mirror mount
 stem.
<p>
<li>If the central glass capillary - which is relatively heavy for an HeNe
 tube - is supported along its length by metal spacers or 'spiders', these
 can move, warp, deform, or loosen up over time.  The result will be a slight
 change in axial bore position.  While the mirrors will still be aligned with
 each-other, they won't be aligned with the bore.  If the tube was dropped or
 whacked, the bore may end up loose or even warped due to movement of its
 supporting structure(s).
<p>
 I've seen one case where the bore was supported at the OC-end by a cup
 affair which had a set of fingers that looked sort of like the pedals of a
 tulip and these were actually loose around the bore (either the tube
 had been used to hammer nails, or the mirror mount next to the cathode can had
 been accidentally used as the cathode connection for this Hughes style HeNe
 tube where the cathode has its own separate terminal - thus overheating the
 cup), or it had overheated due to excessive current or some other cuase.
 Thus the bore was free to move laterally resulting in erratic behavior.
 Orientation and/or tapping on the tube would make the beam come and go.
 There is no way to tighten up such an assembly but if you can find an
 orientation where the end of the bore is actually resting on something solid
 (and not just floating), it should be possible to realign the mirrors for
 that bore position.  (However, this particular tube must also have that
 dreaded warped bore as its behavior is, well, strange - adjustment of the
 mirrors alone isn't sufficient to achieve reasonable power output.)
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htryhlt">The Yellow HeNe Laser Tube
 with a Warped Bore</A>.
<p>
 Some really long lasers with exposed bores (usually with external mirrors but
 not necessarily) have one or more lateral adjustments along the length of the
 bore to correct for unavoidable droop or warp in the glass work.  Where these
 are misadjusted, the output power will be reduced and beam shape may suffer.
 One example of such a laser is the Spectra-Physics model 127 (and the similar
 107 and 907) with the 0-82 (or now called the 907) plasma tube.  It is
 unlikely that anything accidental that didn't smash the tube would result
 in enough misalignment of these to result in no beam at all, but the power
 and beam shape could definitely get messed up.  Then again, I recently
 received a 907 that had supposedly been peaked at 38 mW before shipment
 and wasn't anywhere close to lasing when I received, despite superb packing.
 This remains a mystery.  Generally, they lase weak or at worst, just require
 gentle force on the mirror mounts to get something.
<p>
<li>Where locking collars are used to stabilize the mirror alignment, it is
 possible for these to slip or change position ever so slightly after many
 thermal cycles.  In fact, I've found many older laser heads that were way
 low power to only be suffering from locking collar creep disease. :)
 Collars are common on Melles Griot tubes though most other
 companies don't seem to believe in them (possibly for this reason!  And,
 Melles Griot also appears to have abandoned them for some if not most or all
 of their HeNe tubes).  Sometimes, just not quite so gently rocking the
 collars back and forth via the set screws (but not even turning them),
 or even just tapping on the mount will restore the mirrors to their
 original and proper alignment.
<p>
<li>Another way for alignment could conceivably change on its own would be if
 the tube was tightly fastened to its housing by the mirror mounts (e.g.,
 with cable clamps) and a bending stress was being constantly applied to them.
<p>
<li>And, of course, alignment could have been less than perfect when shipped
 from the factory!  Quality control isn't always so stellar and specifications
 allow for substantial variation in output power.  As long as the tube met
 catalog specs, it may have been considered good enough!  That's one reason
 why HeNe laser output power is almost always rated as 'minimum' - many
 or most tubes produce or are <i>capable</i> of much more.
</ul>
<p>
Note: For really long high power HeNe tubes (e.g., above 15 mW or so), see the
comments in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My
Tube is Good?</A>.  Your tube may need to warm up for 1/2 hour or more, or it
may require external adjusters permanently installed or you may have it
mounted incorrectly.  DO NOT attempt to remedy the mirror alignment problems
by physically bending the mounts if gently rocking the mirrors (see below)
doesn't result in any beam.  Your likelihood of success is about the same as
winning the State Lottery Super Seven.  And if there are flashes from rocking
the mirrors, adjustments may not be needed in any case as there may be nothing
wrong with the tube!
<p>
There are two types of situations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The tube produces an output beam but its power is less than expected or
 seems to be distorted (not the nice circular TEM00 Gausiam beam that is
 produced by most HeNe tube).
<p>
<li>The tube appears to work in all other respects but there is no output beam.
</ul>
<p>
The procedures described below are simplified versions of those that can be
used for testing and adjusting of mirror alignment on many types of lasers
(including HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers where one or both mirrors are external
to the tube.  See the sections: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrail">External Mirror
Laser Cleaning and Alignment Techniques</A>,
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrsema">Sam's Approach for Aligning an External Mirror
Laser with the Mirrors in Place</A> and
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrdmem">Daniel's Method for Aligning External Mirror
Lasers</A>.  The CORD "Laser/Electro-Optics Technology Series"
also has a basic alignmnet procedure outlined in the chapter:
"1-7 Optical Cavities and Modes of Oscillation".)
<p>
These techniques are also ideal for use with internal mirror argon ion
(blue/green) tubes because a readily available red HeNe laser can be used for
testing and adjustment (having a different color laser for the alignment
procedure simplies it considerably).  Here, they have been adapted
specifically for use with small internal mirror HeNe tubes.
<p>
Note: It is assumed that your problem HeNe tube has each of its mirror mounts
separated from the end-cap/electrode assembly by a restricted area that is not
obstructed.  If this is NOT the case (at one or both ends), there may already
be a mirror adjusting device permanently attached to the tube and it will have
to be used (unless it is removed) rather than the tools described below.  In
its favor, fine adjustment with such a device is more precise (though it will
be less convenient for 'rocking the mirror') and alignment problems are less
likely in the first place (unless someone was mucking with the screws!).
Note that some older HeNe tubes have absolutely no means of adjusting the
mirrors - they are bonded directly to the end-cap(s) or glass tube.  In that
case, best to move on with your life. :)
<p>
Rule #1 of mirror alignment: If it's lasing at all, NEVER EVER allow it to
lose that beam entirely without remembering exactly how to get it back!  If
alignment is lost at both ends of the laser, your job is orders of magnitude
more complex than fixing alignment at only one end!

<h3><A NAME="htrmir1">Minor Problems with Mirror Alignment</A></h3>

A beam which is much less intense than expected or distorted (not circular
with a reasonably smooth gaussian profile for a TEM00 laser) may be due to
bad mirror alignment.  Checking mirror alignment as long as the laser
produces some sort of beam is easy and very low risk.  Correcting it
may be possible as well.
<p>
If there is no beam at all <i>at the nominal tube current</i> but no evidence
of bent mirror mounts or other visible damage, this technique may also be used
with care to see if one of the mirrors is SLIGHTLY misaligned.  However, if
gentle rocking of the mirror mount does not result in a beam (see below), DO
NOT attempt to actually bend the mount since there is no way of knowing in
which direction the correction (if any) is needed.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir3">Major Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>.
<p>
Despite all the "CAUTIONS" in the following sections about the sky falling
if you mess up, don't be too timid about checking and adjusting the mirrors
on lasing but weak HeNe laser tubes.  If they are not doing the rated power
after warmup, the most likely cause is mirror alignment, not age or use.
On average, I'd say about 2/3rds of the red HeNe lasers I've gotten surplus
(including eBay) could be tweaked up to rated power or above with just
alignment of the output-end mirror.  As long as you don't lose the beam
entirely, it's a fairly low risk effort with potentially high reward.
However, before attempting this on a valuable high power tube, practice
with junk tubes first.  Just keep in mind that the required change in
mirror orientation is essentially undetectable to the human eye so always
err on the low side.  And, some type of laser power monitor is extremely
desirable to be able to see small changes in output.  A solar cell or
photodiode and DMM is perfectly adequate.

<h3><A NAME="htrmir1a">Quick Check of Mirror Alignment</A></h3>

Here is the instant version of this procedure for quickly checking to see if
one mirror mount is slightly misadjusted: (The more complete version follows
it.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Take a sheet of paper and roll it up into a tight tube that just fits
 over the mirror mount extensions.  Wrap adhesive tape around the end you
 will be using on the tube to prevent it from loosening.  This is your mirror
 rocking 'tool'. (You may need two such tools as some tubes have different
 diameter mounts at each end.)  The nice thing about this tool is that it is
 virtually impossible to either permanently bend the mount accidentally or to
 damage it as long as you are reasonably gentle in what you do.  Another
 benefit is that paper is a good insulator so you won't have a shocking
 experience!  For a paper tube of about 6 inches, a couple of pounds of
 side-ways force can be applied safely on most tubes.
<p>
<li>Power up the tube and while holding it steady (careful: high voltage!),
 use your instant tool to gently rock the mirror mount at each end.  If a tube
 with no output produces a beam for some particular amount of pressure and
 direction, you know it needs mirror alignment.  Similarly, if doing this can
 increase the output power substantially, one or both mirrors also need
 alignment.  With any luck, only one of the mirrors is very slightly
 misaligned.  However, even if it appears to be the first one you tried,
 the other may actually be the problem.  Therefore, don't jump to conclusions
 and attempt to correct it just yet.
</ol>
<p>
If the preceding tests show that alignment is needed, read the following
sections for instructions on exactly what to do next.

<h3><A NAME="htrmir1b">Minor Mirror Alignment Procedure</A></h3>

Here is the more detailed procedure for checking and correcting minor mirror
alignment problems:
<p>
<ol>
<li>A (homemade) tool for rocking (and possibly adjusting) the mirror mount is
 needed.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir2">Means of Adjusting
 HeNe Tube Mirrors</A>.
<p>
<li>Mount the HeNe tube in such a way that the ends are free and clear so the
 adjuster(s) can be used without interference.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>For short HeNe tubes (perhaps 15 inches or less), a suitable support is
  a pair of wooden V-blocks clamped to your workbench.  Secure the tube with
  tape or Velcro straps.
<p>
 <li>For longer HeNe tubes, limit support to exactly two locations at or near
  the ends.  This will permit you to press gently sideways in the center from
  any direction to very slightly bend the entire tube (GENTLY please!).
  There will very likely be a noticeable effect on output power especially
  for tubes over 24 inches in length (even to the point of restoring some
  sort of beam to a tube that wasn't lasing at all).  By determining which
  direction results in the greatest effect can help to identify how the
  mirror(s) should be adjusted to restore power permanently.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Start with the cathode-end (arbitrary choice) and power up the HeNe tube
 at the optimal operating current.  If you are using a plate or tube type
 adjustment tool, take care to assure that it doesn't extend beyond the
 reduced diameter section of tubing and only applies force to the metal of
 the mirror mount, not the mirror or its frit seal!
<p>
<li>Allow the tube to warm up and stabilize a few minutes before checking or
 attempting any adjustment of mirror alignment.  There is a chance that
 during this time, the output power will increase to a normal (expected)
 value.  (And then you can see if it can actually be improved.)  Where there
 was no beam at all initially, one may appear (weak or otherwise) at some
 point during the warmup period making the problem orders of magnitude
 easier!  The longer the tube, the more time is needed for the output to
 stabilize.  A rough guideline is 1 minute for each inch of tube length.
 I just pulled this 'guideline' out of thin air but it's probably better than
 nothing! :)
<p>
<li>GENTLY rock the tool back and forth as you watch the beam's reflection from
 a white surface.  Do this in X (horizontally) and then in Y (vertically).
 Go easy!  It doesn't take much force to change alignment through the entire
 range that matters - perhaps a few ounces at most.  Even modest finger
 pressure will do it - but only try it this way at the cathode-end and only
 if the cathode is grounded!  Don't get carried away and actually bend the
 mount at this time - or break the seal. :-(
<p>
 What you should see is the beam power (brightness) pass through a maximum
 and then diminish on either side of this point.  Testing is best done with
 a laser power meter but one of your eyeballs (or both of them) will work
 well enough for most purposes.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the maximum is at the relaxed position in both axes (you can try the
  45 degree ones as well to be sure), mirror alignment is correct (or at
  least close enough that the chance of being able to improve it without
  using more sophisticated adjustment equipment and a laser power meter
  is vanishingly small.)
<p>
 <li>If the maximum (or any beam at all) is off to one side, you can VERY
  CAREFULLY try bending the mount permanently to attempt to correct it.
  First, determine the angle of the tool that results in the least force
  being needed to correct the alignment.
<p>
  CAUTION: The mirror mount is ultimately attached to the glass envelope of
  the tube.  The glass-metal seal may not be that strong.  Don't get to
  carried away!  With care this adjustment should be possible - barely. :-)
<p>
  Note: Where the maximum intensity results with the mirror very slightly
  deflected, it is possible that the mirror alignment at the
  <i>opposite</i> end of the tube is actually to blame and you are simply
  compensating for its pointing error.  Thus, it is better to check the
  mirrors at both ends of the tube before attempting to adjust either of
  them.  However, the only way to be sure is to measure the maximum beam
  power AND and also examine the shape of the beam.  It should have a
  circular cross-section, a Gaussian profile, and not have any off-axis
  arcs or other artifacts) when both mirrors are precisely parallel to each
  other and perpendicular to the bore of the tube.  (Note: Don't confuse
  a weak spot or spots off to one side due to 'wedge' of the OC mirror with
  an alignment artifact.)
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Increase the force gradually until you have a feel of how much it
   takes to actually deform the mirror mount.  Even a significant pointing
   error will only require a nearly microscopic correction.  The change in
   mirror mount angle that you need to achieve is likely to be a fraction
   of a mR - less than 1 part in 1,000!  Not easy.
<p>
  <li>Approach the desired deflection in small increments and overshoot just
   enough so that the mirror mount springs back to the optimal position.
   Avoid repeatedly bending it back-and-forth or you will eventually be
   using the HeNe tube as a high-tech wall hanging :-(.  Depending on the
   type of adjustment tool used, a bouncing or rocking motion of the tool
   may result in better precision than simply leaning on it.
<p>
  <li>Once optical output is maximum and this point is *roughly* centered
   when testing by rocking the mirror mount, pat yourself on the back and
   consider it as good as it gets.  Don't push your luck!
  </ul>
<p>
 <li>In the case where there was no beam at all, if GENTLE rocking doesn't
  result in a beam at any position, DON'T press your luck at this end!
  The misalignment may be too great for this approach or the problem may be
  with the mirror at the other end of the HeNe tube!
<p>
 <li>In the unlikely case where you overshoot and the beam disappears entirely,
  don't panic (yet).  Immediately mark the orientation of the movement so
  you can try to go in the reverse direction.  Unless the change was large,
  it should be possible to get back to a lasing state relatively quickly.
  Unfortunately, it sometimes takes much longer.  
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Gently remove the tool (if relevant) without applying excessive force to
 the mirror mount.
<p>
<li>Repeat this procedure for the anode end of the tube - just be careful not
 to touch the high voltage!
</ol>
<p>
Alignment should now be the best that is possible by adjusting the mounts at
each end independently.  Confirm by rechecking it at both ends and making any
very *slight* adjustments that may be needed.  This is where the addition of
permanently installed adjusters may be desirable.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmnta">Home-Built Three-Screw Mirror Adjusters for
Internal Mirror Tubes</A> come in handy for tweaking but these may be overkill
for inexpensive HeNe tubes.
<p>
However, although the mirrors will be parallel to each other (ignoring the
mirror curvature), their central axes may not be aligned with the bore.  Thus,
power output could still be low - possibly quite low.  If only one mirror
mount was messed up originally and that is the one you touched, the chance of
there still being major problems is small but I've seen many supposedly
healthy HeNe tubes where mirror alignment was far from optimal even from the
factory!
<p>
If you really want to fully optimize power, you will need to go through the
procedure discussed in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrwalk">Walking the
Mirrors in Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A>.  The use of the three-screw
adjusters is definitely recommended if going beyond this point!
<p>
PERFORM ANY ADJUSTMENTS ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Checking the alignment by
gently rocking the mirror(s) is safe and effective.  However, actually bending
the metal is much more difficult and likely to result in death to your HeNe
tube.  The required pointing accuracy of much less than 1 mR is not much to
fool with!  If the brightness change that is bothering you is just barely
perceptible or you just *think* that it may not be perfectly centered, LEAVE
THE MIRROR ALIGNMENT ALONE!  Plexiglas or wood plates (even with any inserts)
and plastic tubes are really too soft for precise control beyond the elastic
limit (i.e., when actually bending the metal permanently).  Your control will
be poor and you will be much more likely to bend the mirror mount far off to
one side never to work again or break it off completely.  The lever type
adjusters can be more precise but may result in excessive stress to the mounts
if used to make more than very small adjustments since it applies an
unbalanced force spreading the mirror mount and end-cap apart.
<p>
Note that with some tubes - generally longer ones that were obtained surplus -
there may be no way to achieve truly optimal mirror alignment.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htribhl">Inconsistent Behavior of HeNe Laser
Alignment</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrmir2">Means of Adjusting HeNe Tube Mirrors</A></h3>

Unlike the mirror mounts on high quality lab or industrial lasers, those on
inexpensive sealed HeNe tubes are integral to the metal end-caps and not
normally considered user adjustable.  There is usually a restricted region
separating the mirror mount itself from the end-cap and actual deformation or
bending is required to alter mirror alignment.  As expected, there is no easy
way to do this without the assistance of some sort of (homemade) tool - and
repeated flexing of the metal tubing beyond its elastic limit WILL result in
eventual failure of the seal.
<p>
You cannot just grab the mirror mount in your hand and deform them as though
your are Superman (unless you are) since additional leverage and finer control
is needed (not to mention the several kV that may be present at one end of the
HeNe tube end at least!).
<p>
<ul>
<li>For testing that the mirrors are aligned optimally, these tools will enable
  you to 'rock the mirrors' while watching for maximum output beam brightness.
<p>
<li>For actually adjusting the mirror alignment, these tools will enable the
  mirror mounts to be aligned with reasonable accuracy.
</ul>
<p>
Here are some suggestions for easily fabricated tools or adapters which will
permit fairly precise movement of the mirror mounts.  The "plate" and "tube"
types are best for 'rocking the mirror' to check alignment without changing
it.  The "lever" type may be more precise for making initial adjustments since
it applies force at the exact place that it is needed.  The "three-screw" type
is unsurpassed for making fine adjustments in alignment without any risk of
permanently ruining the mirror mounts by bending them too much.  The "collar"
type (<A HREF="3slcmg1.jpg">Three-Screw Locking Collars on Melles Griot HeNe
Laser Tubes</A>) is useful for stabilizing alignment but can be used for
final tweaking as well.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Plate type - Obtain a plate of rigid nonconductive material such as
  Plexiglas about 4 inches square and 3/8ths of an inch thick (high quality
  hardwood plywood will also work but is not as sturdy).  Use a micrometer or
  caliper to measure the diameter of the adjustable portion of mirror mount.
  Drill a hole of this diameter in the center of the plate (preferably using a
  drill press) with a sharp drill bit of the proper type for the material you
  are using.  You want a snug fit but not one that is so tight that installing
  and removing the tool may deform the mount.  If the exhaust tube interferes
  with the tool, drill a small clearance hole for it.
<p>
  You may find that for rocking the mirror mounts, a strip of plastic perhaps
  1" x 6" x 1/4" with a suitable hole drilled near one end may be more
  convenient than a large plate since it won't get in the way of other things
  as much.  However, this may not be sturdy enough for actually adjustments.
<p>
  A more robust enhancement for either one is to obtain or machine a metal
  sleeve that just fits over the mirror mount and glue this into a press-fit
  hole in the insulating board (rather than just using a bare hole).
<p>
<li>Tube type - This adjuster can be constructed from a piece of rigid plastic
  tubing that just fits over the mirror mount.  A six inch length will provide
  enough of a lever to easily 'rock' the mirror and even bend the mirror mount
  if needed.  Even a piece of paper rolled up and taped so it just fits over
  the mirror mount will have enough stiffness to rock the mount for testing.
  Whether it can effectively be used for permanent adjustments will depend
  on its stiffness and the brand of laser.  Melles Griot, Siemens, and
  Uniphase mounts are much more resistant to permanent deformation than
  those on Aerotech lasers for which a tool made from a rolled up piece of
  printer paper is quite adequate though I imagine that with enough
  bending back and forth, they will become work hardeded!  Try not to
  find this out the hard way. :)
<p>
  It probably won't even be necessary to remove the HeNe tube from its case to
  use this tube type tool and it may be your only option if the HeNe tube is
  permanently glued inside a laser head barrel.  But then, how could its
  mirror alignment have gotten messed up in the first place?  Only the tube
  knows for sure and it's probably not telling. :)
<p>
  Note: If testing or adjusting at the output end of the HeNe tube, the
  visibility of the beam may be impaired by this type tool.  In this case, you
  should either use the plate-type tool or watch the weak beam usually visible
  from the opposite end of the HeNe tube (remove any opaque coating that may
  be present).
<p>
  I have actually used a tool of this type (actually, a female Alden high
  voltage connector!) and succeeded in correcting the alignment of a small
  HeNe tube which had no output beam at all.
<p>
  CAUTION: Make sure anything of this sort only applies force to the metal
  mirror mount stem - not the mirror itself or even the frit seal.  I've
  heard of HeNe tubes being ruined due to hairline cracks in the frit, probably
  caused using a similar tool for mirror alignment.  Also, I would avoid
  the use of a metal pipe.  Aside from the issues of electric shock, it
  might apply force at too localized an area and deform the portion of the
  mirror mount stem to which the mirror is attached, cracking the frit or
  the mirror, either of which is fatal to the laser.
<p>
<li>Lever type - Another way of adjusting the mirrors without constructing any
  fancy tools is to use a piece of metal in the narrowed region between the
  mirror mount and HeNe tube end-cap to VERY slightly spread them apart on one
  side.  I have actually used a LARGE straight blade screwdriver for this
  purpose (but with great care so as not to go overboard since there is a lot
  of leverage and the required displacement is microscopic).  If you have a
  sacrificial screwdriver, file a semicircular cutout in the tip to better fit
  the narrow area of the mirror mount - this will improve leverage and reduce
  the mangling of the edges that otherwise occurs.  I constructed a special
  tool from a strip of mild steel by adding the semicircular cutout and
  bending the end around so it can be used inside of a cylindrical laser
  head.  The <A HREF="ssmt1.gif">Sam's Special Mirror Tweaker</A> can be used
  both by rocking toward or away from the mirror or by twisting at right
  angles to this - useful when the exhaust tip-off would interfere with the
  tool for the desired direction of adjustment.  WARNING: The handle-end
  needs to be VERY well insulated if used on the anode mirror mount!  Gentle
  rocking or twisting is used for testing mirror alignment.  Actual adjustment
  is done with more of a "bouncing" motion - letting the inertia of the tool
  jog the mount in small increments.  This is the way I tune up all modern
  HeNe laser tubes.  At some HeNe laser companies, mirror
  alignment on the manufacturing line may actually be done using a similar
  approach.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The advantage of this approach is that it is possible to achieve quite
   fine adjustments by a kind of gentle repetitive pressing while watching
   the beam because you are applying force at the precise location where
   the metal must deform.
<p>
  <li>The disadvantage of this approach is that you can only move in one
   direction without changing the position of the tool or rotating the
   HeNe tube.  Thus, it is not as convenient as the plate or tube type tools
   for checking alignment by rocking the mirror mount.
<p>
  <li>I don't know how far you can push your luck with this technique but it
   is what I generally use for routine tuneup of newly acquired HeNe laser
   tubes and tubes inside heads (at least at the cathode-end)!  I've used it
   on Aerotech, Melles Griot (new style without locking collars), Uniphase,
   and Spectra-Physics lasers so far including resurrecting some that didn't
   lase at all.
  </ul>
<p>
<li>Three-screw type - It is also possible to construct mirror mount adjustment
  assemblies operated by thumbscrews or set screws to correct or optimize the
  alignment.  For a small misalignment, this would avoid the risks of actually
  trying to bend the mounts since the range of motion would still be within
  the elastic limits of the metal.  This type of adjuster is really best for
  fine tweaking where a beam of some sort is already being produced, not for
  initial alignment where the mount is bent at a visible angle!
<p>
  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmnta">Home-Built Three-Screw
  Mirror Adjusters for Internal Mirror Tubes</A> for details.
<p>
<li>Collar type - These consist of a close fitting metal sleeve with three
  tapered point set-screws in tapped holes pressing against the edges of the
  mirror mount and tube end-cap at the restricted region thus applying force
  to very slightly spread them apart.  Most or all higher quality Melles Griot
  laser tubes used to come with a locking collar permanently installed at one
  or both ends (barcode scanner tubes probably don't have any and newer
  Melles Griot tubes appear to have done away with them as well).
  See <A HREF="3slcmg1.jpg">Three-Screw Locking Collars on Melles Griot HeNe
  Laser Tubes</A>.
<p>
  This approach is really best for stabilizing alignment once it has been
  optimizing, not for twiddling.  The control may be too coarse and the
  effects of adjusting any given screw may at times be counter-intuitive
  since it applies a rotating/side-ways torque to the mount.  Adding a tiny
  drop of penetrating oil to each of the screws will minimize the tendency to
  of the screw to 'stick' thus easing adjustments.  However, apparently, some
  major HeNe tube manufacturers (you can guess at least one of them) use this
  approach for all tweaking once the tube comes off the production line.  I
  guess no coarse alignment is needed on a brand new tube. :)
<p>
  I have built my own from that piece inside Sears garbage disposals that
  locks the rotor to the cutting disk thing. :)  (If you have ever disassembled
  an InSinkerator or Sears/Craftsman garbage disposal you will know what I'm
  talking about.  If not, well....)  Any thick steel or aluminum cylinder that
  fits over the mirror mount with a some clearance (at least .5 mm/.020
  inches) can be converted into a locking collar with a bit of work.  A drill
  press will be needed to make three holes around its circumference.  Drill
  the holes as equally spaced and centered as possible.  (A clearance hole or
  slot will be needed if the exhaust tube gets in the way.)  Then tap the holes
  for a screw size slightly thicker than the space between the two sections of
  the mirror mount.  File or grind down three suitable cap screws or set
  screws(Allen wrench type) to give them smooth tapered ends.
<p>
  CAUTION: Use a well insulated tool (hex wrench) for adjustment unless
  you are are sure the mount is directly grounded!  Don't over
  tighten!  The entire useful range is only a small fraction of a turn of each
  screw.  Go overboard and you risk ripping the mirror mount off of the tube -
  which is not generally desirable. :(  If your mirror mount is sitting at a 20
  degree angle, see the information below on initial alignment - you will have
  to bend metal to get it close enough for the collar adjustments to be of any
  value.  Also, the collars on some will have their screws quite tight.  It is
  generally possible to apply a considerable amount of torque to the screws to
  loosed them if the mirror mount is attached to a large metal end-cap as it
  is on the cathode-end of Melles Griot (and many other) tubes.  However,
  where the mirror mount is fused directly into the glass of the tube, it is
  quite possible to break the glass-to-metal seal with excessive force.  One
  way around this is to carefully hold the collar itself and apply the torque
  so that the tube itself is free to move as it see fit.
<p>
  Note: It is virtually impossible to adjust these collars where the tube is
  still mounted inside a cylindrical laser head without providing access
  holes, especially at the anode-end where it is recessed more to provide
  space for the ballast resistor or where the tube is just much shorter than
  the head.  Melles Griot has special tools for this.  I filed down the short
  end of a hex wrench and mounted it in a plastic handle but this just barely
  deals with the cathode-end - for the anode-end, the tube most likely must
  be removed from the laser head.  Or, several such modified wrenches with
  different angles on the hex end are needed to accommodate arbitrary
  orientations of the set-screws (not to mention the issue of high voltage
  insulation).  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htridc1">Getting the
  HeNe Tube Out of a Laser Head Intact</A>.
<p>
  However, if you're willing to modify the laser head very slightly, a simple
  alternative is to drill access holes for a hex wrench in the side of the
  cylinder opposite each of the adjustment screws.  With care, this can be
  done on a drill press with little risk to the laser head.  For the
  cathode-end, the holes just need to be large enough for the wrench (unless
  there is a ballast resistor for the cathode in which case they will need to
  be slightly larger so the wrench can be insulated).  However, for the
  anode-end, the holes will definitely need to be made oversize to allow
  for the hex wrench to be wrapped in a most excellent insulator to deal with
  both the operating voltage, and starting voltage as the discharge is likely
  to drop out momentarily and restart due to the capacitance of the wrench
  when it contacts the anode.  And, the wrench must also be provided with a
  most excellently insulated handle.  I'm really surprised Melles Griot doesn't
  provide access holes as a standard feature.  Nearly every laser head I've
  checked could have benefited from some tweaking. :)  But note that peaking
  the output power may not result in the best overall stability in output
  power with laser head orientation (especially for long high power lasers).
  In any case, I would only recommend adjusting one of the mirrors,
  usually the output mirror - which is the cathode-end for most
  red (632.8 nm) lasers - but may not be for "other color" lasers.  Messing
  too much with both mirrors (aside from the higher risk of losing lasing
  entirely!) may result in a change in beam pointing alignment with respect
  to the laser head.
<p>
  It's probably not necessary to put Loctite(tm) on the collar screws once
  you are happy with alignment (assuming you ever are!).  At least, don't
  do it immediately as there may be some creepage as the screws seat in the
  slots (especially for newly added locking collars).  Later, if you are
  sure that further adjustment will only result in losing your hair over the
  frustration of less than perfect alignment, putting a dab on each screw
  won't hurt.  But as a practical matter, they aren't going to move on
  their own with hobbyist use.
</ul>
<p>
Of course, a nearly infinite number of variations on all of these schemes are
possible.  However, Vice-Grips(tm) (despite being suggested by a person who
should have known better), wrecking bars, and 12 pound hammers are <b>NOT</b>
appropriate tools for adjusting the mirrors on HeNe laser tubes (or any other
lasers, for that matter)!
<p>
CAUTION: For all of the tools, make sure that, pressure is ONLY applied to
the tube of the mirror mount beyond the narrow section - not the part attached
to the body of the HeNe tube, or the glass or frit seal of the mirror
itself.  And, don't go overboard - the amount of force needed isn't that great
if applied at the appropriate place in the proper direction.  Someone I know
("Dr. Destroyer of Lasers") ruined a possibly salvageable large green HeNe
tube from overzealous attempts at alignment by cracking the cathode-end
glass-to-metal seal.  It is especially important to avoid applying any
pressure to the mirror glass (which is quite soft) or the glass frit (glue,
glass 'solder') holding the mirror in place which is even softer.  On some
HeNe tubes, there is just a thin ring of this material and it can be easily
fractured.  I've done it, hisssss. :-(
<p>
CAUTION: DO NOT use a metal (conductive) material for the tool as the mirror
mounts probably connect directly to the high voltage power supply!
<p>
Providing two such tools - for both the cathode and anode ends of the HeNe
tube, may simplify some of the alignment procedures.  This will also be
required if the diameters of the mirror mounts at each end of the tube are not
the same.
<p>
Alignment jigs may be used in the factory during tube manufacture but these are
made from strong rigid components so that even the smallest adjustment of the
thumbscrews actually gets transmitted precisely to the mirror mount.  Anything
as complex as this is overkill for checking mirror alignment but might be
desirable to permit fine tuning while the laser is operating.

<h3><A NAME="htrmir3">Major Problems with Mirror Alignment</A></h3>

Where the mirror mounts are obviously bent or damaged, or if the techniques
described in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir1">Minor Problems with
Mirror Alignment</A> don't result in any beam, the HeNe tube starts normally,
the power supply is providing approximately the nominal current, and other
problems have been ruled out, further testing must be done 'off-line' - not
powered.  This requires a second (working) laser or special optics.  Without
one of these, anything you do will be hit or miss (mostly miss) as the mirrors
must be nearly perfectly aligned before there will be any output beam at all.
What is more likely to happen is that you will end up breaking the seal from
repeated bending of the mirror mount.
<p>
If only one mirror is actually misaligned, you can use the procedures from the
section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir1">Minor Problems with Mirror 
Alignment</A> to identify the error (by rocking the mirror and looking for a
beam with power on) and then carefully tweaking its alignment.  In any case,
this should be attempted first (unless you are sure both ends or misaligned).
<p>
Where the mirrors at both ends of the tube are messed up, the chances of ever
getting a beam with any testing of this type is quite slim - especially for
those high power expensive HeNe tubes.  Getting close won't be good enough
since rocking either mirror by itself will never result in any beam.
<p>
Unless your baby is a high power and/or expensive HeNe tube, it may not be
worth the effort to attempt the procedures described below.  While testing
and/or correcting major mirror alignment may represent an irresistible
challenge, the cost in terms of time, materials, and frustration could prove
to be substantial.  And, as noted, those longer tubes are exponentially more
difficult to align!  For anything longer than 8 or 10 inches, your odds of
success are probably better in your State's Lottery - and then, when you win,
you could just buy a new tube! :)
<p>
As if this isn't enough, if one (or both) of the mirrors on your HeNe tube are
not planar (often concave at the high reflector end), or there is an internal
Brewster plate or etalon, even more care will be required in equipment setup
and subsequent steps may be complicated at that end at least.
<p>
In addition, the output-end (output coupler or OC) mirrors on some lasers have
faces which are ground with some wedge and thus their surfaces are NOT quite
parallel.  This eliminates all ghost beams that are parallel with the main beam
(though there will be one or more weak ghost beams off to one side) and also
minimizes reflections back into the resonator.  Alignment is complicated for a
mirror where wedge is present due to non-parallel reflections and slight
refraction through the mirror.  I don't know how likely wedge is with small
internal mirror HeNe tubes but check for it in any case before considering
attempting alignment of a non-lasing tube (see the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henwbc3">Ghost Beams From HeNe Laser Tubes</A>).  Wedge
is common in large frame HeNe lasers with external mirrors.
<p>
The longer the HeNe tube, the worse it gets!
<p>
I would suggest that if the tube is valuable enough to warrant the expense,
see if one of the HeNe laser manufacturers or laser system refurbishers will
perform the alignment for you.  The ratio of their probability of success
compared to your probability of success will approach infinity.  OK, perhaps
not quite infinity.  It probably won't be significantly greater than the ratio
of the mass of the Sun to that of a typical electron. :-)  I have no idea if
this is a viable option or what it might cost.
<p>
Having said that, if you are still determined to proceed, alignment is best
done with a working narrow beam laser (i.e., HeNe, argon ion, etc.).
<p>
If you do not have a working laser to use for this purpose, various plans
for construction of laser mirror aligners using simple optics and readily
available materials are provided in: "Light and Its Uses" [5]).  However,
some of these are for wide bore tubes and may not work well with the 0.5 to
1.5 mm bores of typical modern HeNe tubes.
<p>
If you have another functioning HeNe laser or tube (you can use the power
supply for the one you will be adjusting since it will not be needed until the
mirrors are roughly aligned), or possibly even a collimated diode laser or
laser pointer) it may be possible to use it as an alignment laser to adjust
the mirrors.  A low power (i.e., .5 to 1 mW) laser is adequate and preferred
since it will be safer as well.
<p>
The general idea is shown in <A HREF="rflalign.gif">Principle of Mirror
Alignment Using Reflected Beam</A>.  With the beam of a low power Alignment
Laser (A-Laser) and the bore of the Tube Under Test (TUT) are lined up, mirror
alignment will be perfect when the beam reflected from the inner (active)
surface of the TUT mirror facing the A-Laser is centered in the aperture of
the A-Laser (AL-Aperture) and/or the hole in the Bore Sight Card (BSC) next
to the TUT.  The diagram shows a TUT mirror mount that is bent at an angle
much much greater than anything you should EVER encounter!
<p>
Plan on spending a lot of time on this.  Therefore, select a location to work
where you can spread out and won't be disturbed for hours.  The kitchen table
is probably not appropriate!
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1 - Mount the Alignment Laser (A-Laser) and Tube-Under-Test
 (TUT)</b>:  Provide a mounting so that both lasers can be arranged
 precisely in line with each other and separated by at least 1 tube length
 (the further apart they are, the more sensitive will be the test to
 pointing accuracy).  This is likely harder done than said but is THE most
 important step as anything you do to the mirror mounts will depend on the
 absolute precision of this setup.  Unfortunately, without an optical bench,
 this may be very difficult to achieve.  However, a length of 2"x4" U or box
 (or larger) extruded aluminum stock should provide the necessary rigidity.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>The TUT should be mounted on a pair of V-blocks.  (Line the V-blocks
  with tape to protect the TUT from scratches if they are made out of
  metal).  Provide some means of firmly but gently fastening it in place so
  it stays where you want it (e.g., elastic bands)!
<p>
 <li>If the non-output mirror of the TUT has an opaque coating, the paint or
  tape will need to be carefully removed.
<p>
 <li>The A-Laser (tube or laser head) needs to be mounted so that it can be
  positioned precisely on-axis with respect to the TUT.  The best way to do
  this is with a pair of X-Y vernier positioners of the type used for this
  purpose in optics research labs.  An alternative (which is what I have
  done) is to adapt some surplus microscope mechanical X-Y stage assemblies
  bolted to a rigid base provided with clamps to hold the alignment laser
  head.  Make sure that the settings can be locked in position so they don't
  drift due to the weight of the A-Laser.  You may need to be resourceful
  and improvise!  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir4">Simple
  Adjustable Optics Platform</A> for details of one very basic approach
  which is quite adequate for checking laser mirror alignment.
<p>
  The adjustable (dual X-Y) mount for the A-Laser and V-blocks for the TUT
  should be securely clamped or screwed to a rigid surface so that their
  relationship cannot accidentally shift by more than the diameter of a fat
  hydrogen atom. :-)
<p>
 <li>Drill or punch a clean circular hole in the center of a white piece of
  cardboard or other opaque material just larger than the diameter of your
  HeNe beam - usually about 1 mm.  Fasten this card to the front of the
  A-Laser so that its beam passes through the center of the hole.
  Henceforth, I will call this the 'AL-Bezel'.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Step 2 - Fabricate a tool for adjusting the mirror mounts:</b> See the
 section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir2">Means of Adjusting HeNe Tube
 Mirrors</A>.
<p>
 Note: If a mirror mount on the TUT is very visibly bent (and this is not
 just compensating for a mirror that was accidentally fritted in place at an
 angle), it should be straightened as best as possible (by eye) before the
 procedure below is attempted.  Otherwise, initial alignment between the
 A-Laser and the TUT will have too much error or be impossible to achieve at
 all.  To check for this damage, rotate the TUT on the V-blocks and watch
 the surface of each mirror.  If *significant* wobble in its angle is
 evident, it should be corrected now by CAREFULLY bending the mount.  At
 least, if you screw up and break the seal, at least you won't have wasted
 any additional time and effort :-(.
</ul>
<p>
The following three steps, (3) through (5), may need to be repeated for the
High Reflector (HR - fully reflecting mirror) and Output Coupler (OC - beam
output) ends of the TUT.  If you find a problem at one end and think you fixed
it, you can try powering up the tube to see if a miracle occurred before
repeating the procedure for the other mirror. :)  You can start with either
end of the tube if you have no idea of which mirror might be messed up.
<p>
If you are using a non-red laser (e.g., green argon ion) it may be possible to
get a clean reflection all the way back in from the far mirror (the HR if the
OC is facing the A-Laser).  If so, everything should be done without changing
TUT position.  This is the preferred way of aligning any laser since correct
allignment can pretty much be assured by getting the A-Laser beam to bounce up
and back inside the tube just as the photons will do when the laser is
operating normally.  However, with the closer mirror in place, this can be
very difficult, confusing, and time consuming unless everything is bolted
down rigidly.  And, even then, may be virtually impossible due to the many
confusing reflections.  It is trivial (well, almost trivial!) for lasers with
removable mirrors but you don't have that luxury. :)
<p>
So, even if you are using different colored lasers, since you really
can't remove - and shouldn't really even move the mirror facing the A-Laser,
the reflected strong spots from its surfaces will likely totally obscure the
much weaker return from the far end - even if it was aligned perfectly.  It
might be possible to just deflect it slightly - just enough to move the
obscuring spots out of the way.  This is easy and safe to to do with those
tubes having built-in three-screw adjusters or three-screw locking collars
but should probably be avoided where it is necessary to bend the mount unless
you can provide a jig (like an adjuster or collar) to just deflect it
slightly and temporarily.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrail">External Mirror Laser Cleaning
and Alignment Techniques</A> for more information - at least to get the
general idea.  Some changes and simplifications will be required.  Also see
the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrdmem">Daniel's Method for Aligning
External Mirror Lasers</A> since this was written specifically for HeNe
lasers.
<p>
If what you have is a tube with an internal HR mirror but external adjustable
OC, that procedure (also with slight modifications) will be more appropriate.
<p>
However, when using a red laser to align a red HeNe laser (or any time the
A-Laser and TUT are similar color lasers) not enough light can pass through
the mirrors to get a return spot - it is too small by a factor of 10,000 or
so!  (In addition, even if you are using different colored lasers, since you
really can't remove - and shouldn't really even move the mirror facing the
A-Laser, the reflected strong spots from its surfaces will likely totally
obscure the much weaker return from the far end - even if it was aligned
perfectly.)   Assuming this is what you are doing, the procedure will have to
be repeated after reversing the TUT end-for-end.  This is what is addressed in
the remainder of this procedure.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 3 - Alignment of the A-Laser and TUT:</b> This must be absolutely
 precise.  A fraction of a mm is significant.  Take your time.  You have all
 week.  Here are two ways of achieving this:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the wavelengths of the two lasers differ significantly, there will
  be enough transmitted light so that the beam from the A-Laser is able to
  pass through both mirrors of the TUT and project a bright spot on a
  screen placed beyond the TUT.  An ideal situation exists where a red
  (632.8 nm) HeNe laser is being used to test a green (543.5 nm) HeNe tube
  or vice-versa.
<p>
  The reason for this behavior is that the dielectric mirrors used in these
  HeNe tubes have a reflectivity which peaks at the laser wavelength.  As
  the wavelength moves away from this, they transmit more and more light.
  For example, if you sight down an unpowered red HeNe tube, it will appear
  blue-green and quite transparent indicating that blue-green light is
  passed with little attenuation but red light is being reflected or
  blocked.  (Actually, orange and possibly yellow light is also reflected
  well by these mirrors as shown by their typical goldish appearance.)
<p>
  However, this approach cannot be used if the wavelengths of the two
  lasers are the same or even fairly close since the reflectivity of the
  two mirrors will be a maximum and very little light will be transmitted.
  This will be the case when attempting to check one red (632.8 nm) HeNe
  laser with another (which is probably what you are doing, right?) or even
  with a 670 nm diode laser pointer.
<p>
  Proceed as follows:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Place the TUT in position on the V-blocks.  Fasten it down so it
   cannot move - even if you should need to apply force to adjust the
   mirror.
<p>
  <li>Position a white card to act as a screen just beyond the far end of
   the TUT.
<p>
  <li>Power up the A-Laser.  Go back and forth between the X-Y adjustments
   at each end of the A-Laser mount to get the beam from the A-Laser to
   pass as cleanly as possible through the bore of the TUT.  Watch for
   where the spot falls on the front of the TUT's mirror and for a clean
   spot exiting the other end of the TUT that is projected onto your
   screen.
<p>
  <li>Alignment of the A-Laser with respect to the TUT is optimal when the
   brightness of the light of the A-Laser exiting the other end of the TUT
   is maximum and the presense of off-axis circles or arcs are minimized
   (the pattern is symmetric).
<p>
   Note: Except for a very short TUT, it is likely that the A-Laser's beam
   would be wider than the bore of the TUT at the far end at least.  Make
   sure you are optimizing the central peak of the beam of the A-Laser by
   checking on all sides to make sure.  Just getting a beam out the other
   end is not enough.
<p>
   For long tubes with exposed bores (or long external mirror lasers with
   exposed bores), any warp of the capillary may prevent the passage of a
   clean beam (as well as mess up the output beam when lasing).  Sometimes
   there are adjustments to maintain bore straightness.  For internal mirror
   lasers, there may be a "This Side Up" label indicating an orientation
   that minimized bore warp.
  </ul>
<p>
 <li>Another approach is to construct an external bore sight - a sort
  of laser capillary simulator - to align the two tubes.  With care, this
  can be at least as accurate as the previous method and will work equally
  well regardless of the relative wavelengths of the A-Laser and TUT.
  From my experience, the bore sight method may be superior especially
  for long HeNe tubes - even if a non-red A-Laser is available!  See
  <A HREF="bsalign.gif">Bore Site Method of Internal Mirror Laser Tube
  Alignment</A> while reading the procedure, below:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Place the TUT in position on the V-blocks.  You will need to remove
   and replace the TUT a couple of times so don't fasten it down yet.
<p>
  <li>Put matching marks on the TUT and the V-blocks so that the TUT can be
   easily removed and replaced without changing its position or rotational
   orientation.  (Even very slight unavoidable manufacturing errors in the
   centering of the capillary in the TUT will be enough to cause problems
   if the orientation can not be exactly duplicated.)
<p>
  <li>Fabricate a pair of Bore Sight Mounts (BSMs) - wood blocks or metal
   angle brackets each having a 1/2" diameter hole approximately centered
   on the TUT axis.
<p>
  <li>Fabricate a pair of Bore Sight Cards (BSCs) - just some 1" x 1" pieces
   of thin cardboard (more white cards!) with a center hole approximately
   the diameter of the TUT's bore that can be fastened onto the BSMs with
   adhesive tape.
<p>
  <li>Position the BSMs so that the BSCs will be almost touching the mirrors
   at each end of the TUT (but take care not to scratch them - a couple of
   rubber covers with their centers removed would be useful).  Fasten the
   BSMs to the base of the V-block assembly with adhesive tape.
<p>
  <li>For each end of the TUT, place a BSC against the BSM and fine tune its
   position so that its hole is precisely centered on the TUT's bore.  Do
   this (using a dental mirror if necessary) by looking through the hole
   in the BSC and down the length of the TUT's capillary.  Fasten the BSC
   in position with adhesive tape and then double check that it is still
   perfectly centered - an error of .1 mm matters!  (Refer to the top
   diagram in <A HREF="bsalign.gif">Bore Site Method of Internal Mirror
   Laser Tube Alignment</A>.)
<p>
   Note: For HeNe tubes with an internal angled Brewster plate or etalon,
   there will be a slight shift in the apparent position of the bore at
   that end due to refraction.  However, the hole must be lined up with
   the physical location of the bore, not its (shifted) image.
<p>
  <li>Temporarily remove the TUT from the V-blocks without disturbing the
   BSMs and their associated BSCs.
<p>
  <li>The holes in the two BSCs now form a bore sight assembly which exactly
   matches the position of the ends of the TUT's actual bore.  Use the
   A-Laser's X-Y adjusters to precisely center its beam on the holes of
   BOTH BSCs.  If the A-Laser's beam is narrower than the hole(s) in the
   BSCs, hold a translucent screen against the BSC so you can see exactly
   where the beam falls.  Once the centering at both ends is perfect, lock
   the X-Y adjusters in position and then double check that nothing has
   moved.  (Refer to the middle diagram in <A HREF="bsalign.gif">Bore Site
   Method of Internal Mirror Laser Tube Alignment</A>.)
<p>
  <li>Replace the TUT in the proper orientation on the V-blocks.  Fasten
   it down so it cannot move - even if you should need to apply force to
   adjust the mirror.  At some point, it may be desirable to remove the
   BSM nearest the A-Laser.  However, it does serve as a second screen to
   view the reflected spot - with double the sensitivity to mirror
   deflection as the AL-Bezel on the A-Laser (because the beam from the
   A-Laser first bounces off the TUT's mirror, then the OC mirror of the
   A-Laser, and back to the BSC on the front of the TUT).  (Refer to the
   bottom diagram in <A HREF="bsalign.gif">Bore Site Method of Internal
   Mirror Laser Tube Alignment</A> and <A HREF="rflalign.gif">Principle
   of Mirror Alignment Using Reflected Beam</A>.)
  </ul>
<p>
  Alternatives to the pair of BSCs include a certifiably dead HeNe tube of
  the same diameter as the TUT with its mirrors removed (so red light can
  pass easily) or some other substitute that would sit on the V-blocks with
  tiny holes at each end to align the A-Laser's beam.  If you do opt for the
  dead tube approach, first make sure you have a valid death certificate for
  it - see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My 
  Tube is Good?</A> and then make sure to offer the appropriate ritual
  prayers and sacrifices to the "god of dead lasers" before dismembering the
  tube! :-)  In either case, make sure your substitute actually provides
  equivalent alignment to the TUT - as noted above, manufacturing tolerances
  may result in the bore being noticeably off center even in a healthy tube.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Step 4 - Checking and correcting the alignment:</b>  With everything in
 position and the A-Laser powered up, there should be a reflection of the
 A-Laser's beam back onto the AL-Bezel from the mirror of the TUT.  If the
 alignment of mirror facing the A-Laser is perfect, these reflections, it be
 entirely within the hole in the AL-Bezel with just a symmetric halo (with
 some dancing interference fringes showing) due to multiple reflections
 between the A-Laser and TUT's mirrors.  This assume that the mirror is
 planar and has no wedge.  A grossly misaligned mirror is shown in
 <A HREF="rflalign.gif">Principle of Mirror Alignment Using Reflected
 Beam</A>.  Where you are using the bore sight method, the hole in the
 BSC may be used instead of the AL-Bezel (which is then removed as shown
 in the bottom diagram).  This doubles the sensitivity to alignment error.
<p>
 There will actually be two sets of reflections from the two surfaces
 of the mirror glass of the TUT.  The one from the inner surface - which is
 probably much stronger, especially for the OC which is Anti-Reflection (AR)
 coated) - is the relevant one but both should coincide when alignment is
 correct (assuming no wedge).  This is shown in <A HREF="henedot.jpg">HeNe
 Laser with Reflected Dot</A>.
<p>
 In the case of a curved mirror, one of the spots will be somewhat spread
 out and if the centering of your A-Laser isn't absolutely perfect, it will
 be offset to one side even if the mirror alignment is perfect (but I
 already warned you about dealing with tubes having curved mirrors).  Go
 bad and double check the setup - if it is possible to center this
 reflection with the A-Laser beam still passing cleanly through the bore,
 alignment of this mirror is probably fine.  The reflection from the curved
 inner surface can be identified by moving the A-Laser from side-to-side: It
 will move by a greater distance than the reflection from the flat outer
 surface.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>CAUTION: If the alignment looks good, DON'T TOUCH IT!  Maybe the real
  problem is at the other end of the TUT or something else!
<p>
  If the reflections are off to one side, FIRST CHECK THAT YOUR SETUP HAS
  NOT SHIFTED POSITION.  GO BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR A-LASER and TUT
  ALIGNMENT!  For slight errors, problems with the setup are more likely
  than problems with the TUT's mirror alignment.
<p> 
 <li>If you are positively sure beyond any shadow of a doubt that imperfect
  TUT mirror alignment is the cause of your not-centered reflections, you
  can attempt to use your tool to CAREFULLY adjust the mirror mount until
  the reflections are perfectly centered.
<p>
  Again, double check that the critical alignment of the two lasers hasn't
  shifted before messing with the mirrors!
<p>
  CAUTION: The mirror mount is ultimately attached to the glass envelope of
  the tube.  The glass-metal seal may not be that strong.  Don't get to
  carried away!  With care this adjustment should be possible - barely. :-)
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Increase the force gradually until you have a feel of how much it
   takes to actually deform the mirror mount.  Even a significant pointing
   error will only require a small correction.  And, the final accuracy
   needs to be a fraction of a mR - much less than 1 part in 1,000!  Not
   easy.
<p>
  <li>Approach the desired deflection in small increments and overshoot just
   enough so that the mirror mount springs back to the optimal position.
   Avoid repeatedly bending it back-and-forth or you will eventually be
   using the TUT as a high-tech wall hanging :-(.
<p>
  <li>As alignment for the mirror you are adjusting approaches perfection,
   you will see multiple spots from multiple reflections between the
   output mirror of the alignment laser and the mirror of the TUT as the
   light bounces back and forth between them.  When perfect, there will
   likely be a halo of dancing interference fringes surrounding the hole
   as well.
  </ul>
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Step 5 - Double check the (new) alignment:</b> If you adjusted the
 mirror, go back and check the alignment of the A-Laser and TUT to assure
 that it is still perfect.  A significant change in the angle of the mirror
 could affect the apparent location of the bore of the TUT used for alignment
 in step (3).  In this case you will need to correct the alignment and then
 repeat steps (4) and (5).  Relax - this process will converge so you won't
 be stuck in an infinite loop forever!
<p>
<li><b>Step 6 - Flip the tube:</b> Turn the TUT around and repeat steps (3) to
 (5) for its other mirror.
</ul>
<p>
If mirror alignment was your problem (and for larger tubes, if you believe
in minor miracles!), the TUT should hopefully now produce at least some
output beam when powered up.
<p>
<ul>
<li>If it produces even a very weak beam, all you need to do is to perform
 final mirror alignment.  There still may be a lot of work ahead of you
 but with care, the rest is easy!  Just make sure you never make an
 adjustment such that you lose the beam entirely.
<p>
<li>If there is no evidence of a beam at all, one or both mirrors may still
 be too far out of alignment.  Go back and repeat steps (4) to (6) for
 both ends of the TUT.  If there is still no output, with luck, only one
 mirror is now at fault and can be identified and corrected with the TUT
 powered up.
</ul>
<p>
In either case, see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking and
Correcting Mirror Alignment of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrwalk">Walking the Mirrors in Internal Mirror Laser
 Tubes</A></h3>

If your laser tube produces any sort of beam and the alignment of both mirrors
independently is optimal (either after testing and/or after correcting it as
described in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>, it's time to
either be happy with what you have, or attempt to optimize the output power
and beam quality by adjustments to both mirrors.
<p>
Indications for the need of further alignment include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Output power with proper excitation (e.g., the optimal tube current) is
 significantly less than expected based on tube specifications and there is no
 evidence of other physical problems (like contamination of the gas fill or
 damaged mirror coatings).
<p>
<li>The beam profile is not perfectly circular and Gaussian (assuming it is
 supposed to be TEM00).
<p>
<li>There are beam artifacts like off-axis arcs, rings, spots, or fuzzy areas.
 (However, a single weak spot or row of spots is probably just due to the OC
 having some 'wedge'.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henwbc3">Ghost
 Beams From HeNe Laser Tubes</A>.)
</ul>
<p>
See <A HREF="mirwalk1.gif">Effects of Walking the Mirrors</A> for an
exaggerated (hopefully!) illustration of why this happens.  As can be seen,
although the mirrors may be perfectly parallel to each other and there is
still some output, by not being aligned with the bore/capillary, portions of
the beam are cut off, less than the full amount of gain medium participates in
the lasing process, and there can be reflections from the walls and other
structures in the tube to create artifacts.
<p>
For external mirror lasers with fine adjustment screws on the mirror mounts,
the "Walking the Mirrors" procedure isn't really at all difficult: Both
mirrors are moved in the same small increments using the micrometer screws (so
they remain parallel), first in X until power is maximized, then in Y, and
then back and forth optimizing each direction until no further improvement is
detected.  This aligns the mirrors so they are precisely perpendicular to the
bore.  Your typical obsessive-compulsive laser physicist type spends his/her
life playing with these knobs. :)  See the section:
<A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrwalk">Walking the Mirrors in External Mirror
Lasers</A> for more info.
<p>
For an internal mirror laser tube without screw adjusters, a modified approach
must be used.  I will tell you up front that this is a royal pain and is most
easily done if you have three hands (or at least a rigid means of mounting
the laser tube and the proper tools).  But it can be done and for some cases -
most commonly where a tube is marginal to begin with due to age or use, or
where someone else, (of course)! has played with the alignment - the
improvement in performance (power output and beam quality) over adjusting the
mirrors independently may be quite dramatic.
<p>
For all measurements of output power, a laser power meter is highly desirable.
It doesn't need to be fancy since maximizing power is what's important, not an
accurate value.  And, an analog meter (one with a needle!) is usually
far superior to a fancy digital readout for this purpose since it responds
faster and is easier to interpret using the mediocre processing power of
the human brain.  Anything that will convert photons
to a meter reading will be fine including the absolutely trivial ones
described in the sections starting 
with: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm3">Sam's Super Cheap and Dirty Laser Power
Meter</A>.
<p>
It's just that your basic allotment of eyeballs isn't very good at
detecting small changes in intensity! :)  Note that mode cycling of your HeNe
tube will result in small variations in output power - these can be annoying
but need to be mentally discounted in determining the maximum power output
readings.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The best way to walk the mirrors is to fabricate and install the adjusters
 described in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmnta">Home-Built
 Three-Screw Mirror Adjusters for Internal Mirror Tubes</A> if your tube
 doesn't already have them.  Then, the same basic procedure as used with
 external mirror lasers can be used for your internal mirror tube except that
 there will be three (not quite independent) axes to deal with.  However, this
 is really no problem and the same rules apply: Optimize each axis before
 proceeding to the next.  Go around a couple of times and you are done. :)
<p>
<li>Where your tube doesn't have screw adjusters and you are too lazy to
 build them, the procedure is awkward but can still be done.  In some ways it
 is actually simpler as only one axis will need to be optimized - the trick is
 to locate it.  However, I expect that you will wish you had constructed the
 three-screw adjusters before you are done with this effort:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Fasten the tube down securely to a rigid support so that both mirror
  mounts are accessible for whatever means of mirror adjustment you have
  available.  (See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir2">Means of
  Adjusting HeNe Tube Mirrors</A>.)  It will be necessary to be able to rock
  BOTH mirrors at the same time in a given axis.  Thus, there must be two sets
  of adjusters AND at least the one for the anode-end of the tube must be well
  insulated!  To enable multiple axes/directions to be tried, it is probably
  best to be able to rotate the tube.  Mark the top of the tube so you can
  keep track of its orientation (if rotating it).
 <p>
 <li>Power up the tube and set up your laser power meter to be monitoring
  its output.  If you are just using your eyes, project the beam through a
  lens (positive or negative) so that it spreads into a large spot on a white
  card.  This will help you to detect small changes in brightness as well as
  to show beam artifacts which also are an indication of alignment problems.
  As you approach alignment perfection, the beam will look more and more like
  that ideal circular Gaussian profile.  When alignment is off, it can be
  elliptical, have fuzzy edges, sometimes extra off axis rings or spots (but
  don't confuse these with wedge in the OC), etc.
</ul>
<p>
Now you are all set.  The following assumes you can only deflect the left-hand
mount one way (specifically, downwards, as would be the case if you were
using a big screwdriver as a lever type adjuster).  If you can go both ways
and/or don't need to rotate the tube to check different directions, the
following procedure to determine misalignment direction and magnitude will go
a lot quicker.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Using your mirror adjustment tools (insulated if necessary!),
  <b>gently</b> deflect the left-hand mirror mount <i>downward</i> just enough
  to cause the power reading to be reduced slightly (say, 10 to 25 percent).
  At the same time, <b>gently</b> deflect the right-hand mirror mount
  <i>upward</i> and rock it up and down attempting to locate the point of
  maximum power.  (Left and right, and up and down are arbitrary - interchange
  if more convenient as long as you are consistent.)  The objective is to
  locate the point of maximum power while maintaining the mirrors parallel
  but changing their pointing angle by equal amounts.
<p>
 <li>Note the maximum power reading on your meter or eyeball(s). :)
 <p>
 <ul>
  <li>If the new maximum power reading is greater than the previous one,
  repeat the above test after shifting the deflection direction by about 45
  degrees (e.g., by rotating the tube by 45 degrees).
 <p>
  <li>If the new maximum power reading is less than or equal to the previous
  one, go back and attempt to locate the direction resulting in the maximum
  reading.  Then, narrow down the direction by rotating the tube in smaller
  increments.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
In English, what we are attempting to do is find the direction and amount to
adjust the mirror mounts to line up the mirrors with the bore.  The proper
direction will result in the most dramatic power increase with both mounts
deflected.  The opposite direction will result in absolutely no power
increase - power will always decrease no matter how much either mount is
deflected.  In fact, this is a good test to determine if your adjustment
direction is correct: Rotate the tube 180 degrees and confirm that power
always descreases, even for very slight deflections of the left-hand mount.
<p>
Once the direction and magnitude of the error has been determined, it is time
to actually adjust the mounts.
<p>

<ul>
<li>While still being gentle, vary the deflection of the left-hand mount (in
 the direction determined above) in small increments while rocking the
 right-hand mount in the opposite direction to maximize the peak power output.
 This will identify the magnitude of the required alignment change.
<p>
<li>Once the power output has been maximized, release the right-hand mount and
 note the (now reduced) power reading.
<p>
<li>Use your mirror adjuster to now bend the left-hand mount permanently to
 obtain the same power reading as above.
<p>
<li>Finally, bend the right-hand mirror mount to restore and maximize power
 output.
</ul>

<p>
Mirror alignment should now be absolutely positively optimal and perfect. :)
<p>
As mentioned numerous times, DON'T attempt this unless you are determined to
do something to help your tube.  One slip of the adjuster and you will be
worse off than before and may need to go back to square one: acquiring a new
tube or at least restoring basic alignment.  If the tube's deficiency is
small, leave it alone!  Or, install the three-screw adjusters which are a lot
less likely to kill a tube than a big screwdriver!
</ul>
<p>
Tubes that are marginal due to age or use and output a very weak beam seem to
benefit the most - a 200 percent or more boost in power is quite possible
(though it will still likely be less than their ratings when new).  This is
probably because the gain is lower and therefore mirror alignment becomes even
more critical.  The same alignment errors might only result in a 10 or 20
percent reduction in power for a tube in good condition.  And the misalignment
might have always been present - factory quality control isn't perfect and
tubes would be considered good enough as long as their catalog ratings are met
or exceeded when new.
<p>
I have improved the performance of several internal mirror HeNe tubes using
these techniques.  One of these is discussed in the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrwslh">Strengthening a Weak Siemens HeNe Tube</A>.
Another was a cute little Melles Griot 5" HeNe tube which was only putting out
.1 mW.  It's output was boosted to about .3 mW by walking the mirrors (still
less than the .5 to 1 mW for other similar size tubes).  Some additional
improvement might be possible with more work.

<h3><A NAME="htrmir4">Simple Adjustable Optics Platform</A></h3>

For simple alignment checks, an adjustable platform can be constructed in
about 10 minutes from common materials.  This isn't quite as precise as an
expensive lab jack or the all-metal version shown in:
<A HREF="alplat1.jpg">Alignment Laser Three-Screw Platform</A>.  However,
for many purposes, it may be good enough.  Of course, there's no law against
making the design below out of metal!  The same basic approach can be used
for either the alignment laser (as shown in the photo) or the mounting for
the Tube Under Test (TUT).  From my experience and that of others, the latter
arrangement is more intuitive for aligning the TUT's bore to the A-Laser's
beam.  However, it may be difficult to prevent the platform's position from
shifting while checking or adjusting the mirrors compared to a mounting with
a fixed base that can be clamped to the workbench.  And, easily accommodating
multiple size TUTs would be more of a challenge.
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrseaz">Sam's Eazalign(tm)
Internal Mirror Laser Tube Alignment Platform</A> since your internal mirror
laser tubes may deserve only the finest in alignment equipment! :)
<p>
You will need:
<ul>
<li>A piece of Plexiglas, hardwood plywood, or even high density particle
  board, about 6" x 12" x 3/4" (or whatever size your laser or other optical
  system will fit on with room to spare to spare for the adjustment screws).
<p>
<li>Three, tapped (totally through) metal spacers about 3/4" long.  A thread
  size of 8-32 or 10-32 is adequate though more threads/inch would be even
  better.
<p>
<li>Three, 2" (or longer) machine screws to fit the tapped spacers.
<p>
The following is best done using a drill press but it is not essential:
<p>
<li>Drill holes so the tapped spacers will be a snug fit in the board 1/2" from
  the corners at one end of the board and at the center of the other end, 1/2"
  from the edge.
<p>
<li>Press the spacers into the holes.  If they are too loose, secure them with
  5-minute Epoxy (how else to guarantee a total assembly time of less than
  10 minutes!).
<p>
<li>Round off the ends of the machine screws using a file or grinding wheel so
  they will each contact the surface upon which this assembly will rest at a
  single point.
<p>
<li>Install the machine screws into the tapped spacers so they poke out of the
  bottom of the platform.
</ul>
There you have it!  This will permit a laser or other optical system secured
to this platform to be adjusted easily for height, pitch, and yaw.  If you
need more of a height adjustment range, sit the platform on something else.
<p>
While this isn't quite as precise as one milled out of a solid block of high
strength (aircraft quality) aluminum alloy using anti-backlash spring-loaded
micrometer adjustment screws, it will suffice for many purposes and costs next
to nothing!

<h3><A NAME="htrseaz">Sam's Eazalign(tm) Internal Mirror Laser Tube Alignment
 Platform</A></h3>

Note: It is recommended that the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking and Correcting Mirror Alignment of
Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> be read first so that the various terms,
alignment techniques, and risks are understood.
<p>
OK folks, this is what you have all been waiting for. :)  The <b>ULTIMATE</b>
in precision and convenience.  Well, sort of, at least if you construct and
use it with reasonable care.  Depending on the length of the platform, almost
any size tube can be checked for alignment or realigned quickly and easily.
Does this sound like a sales pitch yet?? :)  The Eazalign platform combines the
Primary Alignment Laser (PA-Laser), adjustable Tube Under Test (TUT) mount
(ATM), optional Bore Sight Mounts (BSMs), and Far Reflector (FR) mirror or
Secondary Alignment Laser (SA-Laser) into one handy (but not so compact)
package. ;-)
<p>
This approach should also do a decent job with those annoying curved mirrors
since the same reference is used at both ends of the TUT without the need to
remove and replace it.
<p>
In addition to supporting the various alignment techniques discussed
previously, the Eazalign platform adds a way of providing a return beam so
that both mirrors can be checked and aligned in place (without turning the
tube end-for-end).  For small to medium size HeNe tubes (up to 10 inches or
so) using a different color A-Laser (e.g., green HeNe to align a red HeNe,
this can be accomplished without the need for a second A-Laser by using a
flat first surface mirror (the Far Reflector or FR) on an adjustable mount
set up to return the A-Laser beam precisely back to its output aperture
<p>
However, for longer tubes or where the PA-Laser is the same color as the TUT
and it isn't possible (at least in finite time) to get a clean beam down the
bore, the use of SA-Laser will be needed.  Where the Bore Sight Method is used
to align the TUT to the A-Lasers, the A-Laser colors won't matter.
<p>
The basic setup is depicted in <A HREF="eazalign.gif">Eazalign Internal
Mirror HeNe Laser Tube Mirror Alignment Platform</A> and consists of the
following components:

<ul>
<li>Main Mounting Rail (MMR) - Ideally this is milled out of a solid block of
 stainless. :)  Just kidding.  A length of 2" x 6" extruded aluminum U or box
 stock is nearly as good, though somewhat expensive.  But, a well seasoned
 length of a pine 2" x 6" should suffice for occasional use.  However, if you
 are going into the HeNe laser repair business, invest in the aluminum.
<p>
 The length will be determined by the maximum size of the TUT that needs to be
 accommodated and the size and number of A-Lasers.  Figure 3 to 4 TUT lengths
 plus space for the A-Laser(s) or FR mirror.
<p>
<li>Primary A-Laser (PA-Laser) - All implementations will have one of these.
 Any 1 to 5 mW HeNe laser producing a narrow well collimated beam can be used.
 However, when aligning the TUT to the PA-Laser by passing its beam down the
 TUT's bore, the PA-Laser must be of a sufficiently different wavelength so
 that enough of its gets through the dielectric mirrors.  This usually would
 mean a green HeNe laser to align a red one or vice-versa.  (A green or blue
 argon ion laser could be used but I personally dislike running a power hog
 for this purpose.)  However, note that while a green beam will get through
 a red tube quite well, all sorts of confusing reflections may be present as
 well which can be quite confusing.
 
<p>
 The PA-Laser must be rigidly fastened in position and centered radially
 aimed precisely down the axis of the Mounting Rail.  Its height will depend
 on the design of the Adjustable TUT Mount (below) to enable TUTs of various
 diameters to be accommodated.  An easy way to mount the PA-Laser is to
 attach it to a metal plate or piece of wood and then fasten this to the
 main platform using three screws with a combination of a flat washer, one or
 more split, Bellview (cupped), or rubber washers, and another flat washer.
 The compressible washers will provide enough range of adjustment to line up
 the PA-Laser's beam.  Stiff springs could also be used.
<p>
<li>Adjustable TUT Mount (ATM) - This must be able to move the front and back
 ends of the TUT vertically and horizontally more or less independently.
 Using the basic arrangement of the Three-Screw Optics Platform with the
 addition of V-blocks for the TUT and a pair of spring loaded screws pushing
 it side-ways will suffice.  From my experience and that of others, it is
 easier to adjust the TUT's mount than the A-Laser(s) to align its beam to the
 TUT or Bore Sight.  Furthermore, for this technique, the A-Laser(s) should
 only need to set set once and then left alone.
<p>
 The ATM should be located along the MMR such that the distance between the
 front mirror of the longest TUT to be accommodated is at least one of these
 TUT lengths from the PA-Laser's output aperture.
<p>
 The adjustments closest to the PA-Laser should be located approximately
 at the same axial position as the front mirror of the TUT.  This will
 make its settings mostly independent of the other set of adjustments.
 Obviously, those would ideally be located near the rear mirror of the TUT
 but this would only be possible for a single size TUT!
<p>
 It is critical that these adjustments be quite precise and have a provision
 to be locked in place once they are set.  Thus, fabricating the ATM out of
 aluminum or steel with micrometer screws would be best but wood will work
 here as well unless you are going into production alignment. :)
<p>
<li>Bore Sight Mounts and Bore Sight Cards - These will be needed where the
 Bore Sight method is used to align the A-Laser(s) to the TUT.
<p>
<li>Far Reflector (FR, if used) - Where the PA-Laser's beam is still quite
 narrow after a distance of about 4 maximum TUT lengths (say 2 mm diameter)
 and the PA-Laser's beam is to be passed through the TUT's bore, an SA-Laser
 is not essential.  A planar (or slightly concave) first surface mirror on an
 adjustable mount can be used to return the SA-Laser's beam back to the TUT's
 mirror.
<p>
 The mount doesn't have to be anything special - I used one from a barcode
 scanner.  It is basically stamped sheet metal with two adjustment screws but
 has adequate precision and works quite well.  After it is adjusted, fasten
 a white card with a hole the size of the PA-Laser's beam at the FR to it to
 act as an output aperture for the virtual SA-Laser.
<p>
<li>Secondary Alignment Laser (SA-Laser, if used) - The use of the SA-Laser is
 the preferred method where the platform is long enough that by the time the
 A-Laser's beam has passed through the TUT and reflected from the FR mirror,
 it is excessively wide to provide adequate accuracy in alignment.  This is
 typically on the order of 1 meter.  It is actually better in all cases but
 might not be justified for short tubes or occasional use.  However, if you
 are aligning same color tubes, passing the SA-Laser beam through the TUT
 is not an option.
<p>
 Like the PA-Laser this can be any 1 to 5 mW HeNe laser with a narrow well
 collimated beam.  Its color doesn't matter since there is no need to pass it
 through the TUT's bore.  Mounting should be similar to the PA-Laser with its
 output aperture about 1 TUT length beyond the TUT's far mirror (assuming the
 longest TUT to be aligned).
</ul>
<p>

The PA-Laser and SA-Laser are set up to their beams are precisely aligned
with each-other.  In other words, the beam from the PA-Laser is centered on
the SA-Laser's output aperture and vice versa.  If adjustable mounts are not
used for both lasers, this can be done with shims.  Where the FR mirror is
used in place of the SA-Laser, it is adjusted so that the return beam is
precisely centered on the PA-Laser's output aperture.
<p>
To use this system:

<ul>
<li>The alignment of the PA-Laser and SA-Laser or FR mirror is confirmed to
 be correct.
<p>
<li>The TUT is installed and locked in place on the ATM and it is adjusted for
 a clean PA-Laser beam through the TUT's bore.  Or, if using the Bore Sight
 method, the BSMs and BSCs are installed and checked for proper alignment
 with the PA-Laser beam and then the TUT is attached to the ATM and adjusted
 to line up with the holes in the BSCs.
<p>
<li>The TUT's mirror closest to the PA-Laser is checked and adjusted if
 necessary to place center its reflection in the output aperture of the
 PA-Laser.  If it is quite close to start, double check the position and
 orientation of the ATM - with a curved mirror, slight radial position errors
 will result in a shift in post angle.  There may be nothing wrong with the
 alignment.  If tweaking the ATM can center the spot and still result in a
 clean beam through the bore, alignment is fine at that end.
<p>
<li>The TUT's mirror furthest from the PA-Laser is then checked and adjusted
 to center the reflections on the FR or SA-Laser aperture.
</ul>

That's it!  Since only one reference is used (the precisely centered beams of
the PA-Laser and FR mirror reflection or SA-Laser) and the TUT is never moved
once it is installed on the ATM, this should result in very precise alignment
in a short amount of time.

<h3><A NAME="htriaat">Initial Alignment and Tweaking of Three-Screw
 Adjusters</A></h3>

These are the type found on some HeNe tubes which are way too small to really
provide fine control.  See <A HREF="3slcmg1.jpg">Three-Screw Locking Collars
on Melles Griot HeNe Laser Tubes</A>.  However, they do work well enough with
a bit of care and a lot of patience! :)  Home-built adjusters can be
constructed somewhat larger so the adjustment range will be greater (see
the section below).
<p>
Realize that the 3 adjustments are not really independent since each uses the
other two as the pivot.  However, the net effect is fairly predictable.
<p>
CAUTION: Don't get carried away while turning these screws - it is possible to
rip the mirror mount off the tube!  The entire adjustment range is less than
1 turn of each screw once they are snug.
<p>
Any of the procedures and setups described above can be used to determine when
the mirror is properly aligned.  For longer tubes, I recommend the Instalign
technique be attempted first.  With care (and a bit of luck), this will get
you to a lasing state without the requirement for fancy alignment platforms
and jigs.
<p>
The following assumes that only one end of the tube is misaligned.  Where both
ends of the tube are messed up or in an unknown state, your task is just that
much more challenging! :)

<ul>
<li>Apply a tiny drop of lubricating oil or graphite to the threads and tip
 of each screw to minimize sticking.
<p>
<li>Start with all 3 screws loosened at least 1 turn before contact.
<p>
<li>Determine which direction the mount needs to be deflected and carefully
 turn the screw or screws opposite that direction to bring the reflected beam
 back towards the center.  For the Instalign procedure, this would be 1/2 of
 the total beam displacement.
<p>
<li>Turning each screw somewhat beyond the optimal setting will result in
 actual bending of the mount.  This is only a fraction of a turn so go slow.
 Move it a bit, back off, and see where it remains.  This is best done where
 the other 2 screws are loose but the options on movement angle are, of
 course, limited (as in, only 3).  But, with care, iterating among the 3
 screws will get you where you want to be eventually.  The objective should be
 to adjust the mount so that with all three screws loose, it is close to
 optimal alignment.  Then, only very slight movement will be needed to
 tweak it.
<p>
<li>Where possible, it's better to loosen the screw or screws on the opposite
 side than to further tighten a screw if it is already more than snug.
<p>
<li>Once the alignment is as good as you can make it from the reflected spot,
 apply power to the tube.  If there is a beam, alternately adjust each screw
 to peak the power.
<p>
<li>Pressing on the mount (with an insulated stick if it is the anode) will
 help determine which screw to turn and whether to loosen or tighten it.
<p>
<li>There will always be a certain amount of hysteresis in the screw
 adjustments so it will probably be necessary to back off, then
 approach from the loosened state if you overshoot.  For a long tube
 (e.g., 15 inches), the entire adjustment range for lasing will be a
 small fraction of a turn of each screw.  If the beam disappears
 entirely while adjusting one screw, restore it using that same screw!
 Never attempt to adjust another one if there is no beam - you will
 have to go back to the initial alignment to get it back!
<p>
<li>Check for mirror alignment at the other end of the tube using the mirror
 walking procedures and correct it if necessary.
<p>
<li>With the power at its maximum, adjust all three screws equally (while
 making sure the beam doesn't disappear!) so that the loosest of them is still
 quite snug (this will mean tightening or loosening the screws depending on
 where they were set).  Then retweak the output power after adequate warmup.
 This will assure that the screws won't change position with thermal cycles.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrmnta">Home-Built Three-Screw Mirror Adjusters for Internal
 Mirror Tubes</A></h3>

It is possible to construct mirror mount adjustment assemblies operated by
thumbscrews or set screws to correct or optimize the alignment of HeNe and
other internal mirrors laser tubes with the common mirror mounts consisting
of a pair of tubes separated by a compliant narrow section.
<p>
For a small misalignment, this would avoid the risks of actually trying to
bend the mounts since the range of motion would still be within the elastic
limits of the metal.  This type of adjuster is really best for fine tweaking
where a beam of some sort is already being produced, not for initial
alignment where the mount is bent at a visible angle!  And, as noted in the
section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking and Correcting Mirror
Alignment of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A>, some (mostly older) HeNe tubes
have these built-in for both mirrors or possibly just the OC.
<p>
See <A HREF="mntadj.gif">Typical HeNe Tube with Three-Screw Adjusters
Added</A> for an example of one approach.  With even very basic machining
skills and a little scrap metal, a set of these should be very easy to
fabricate.
<p>
I would recommend 1/8" to 3/16" brass or mild steel for the plates.  (In some
cases, the inner plate can just be replaced with a protective metal or plastic
washer bearing against the metal end cap of the tube.)  Aluminum would
probably be acceptable as well but might deform or wear too easily if the
adjustments get much of a workout. :)  (Even acrylic plastic (Plexiglas) or
other non-metal material might be adequate for minor corrections and in
addition to easier machining, have the benefit of being an insulator!)  Drill
the holes in the center of the plates (preferably reamed to the correct size)
to just fit over the two sections of the mirror mount(s) and use Epoxy or
another adhesive to secure them in place.  A clamp arrangement would also work
(and permit easy removal of the adjusters in the future) as long as it is
designed so that there is no tendency to deform the tubes of the mount and not
tightened excessively - which could ruin your whole day by cracking the
glass-to-metal seal(s).  Use fine-thread set-screws with rounded tips.
<p>
The adjusters should be firmly attached (glued with Epoxy or carefully
clamped as noted above) to the HeNe tube end-caps or bolted to a rigid
baseplate.  (However, in the latter case, expansion of the HeNe tube as it
warms up will complicate matters.)  They could be left permanently in place
applying the proper force to the mirror mounts to maintain mirror alignment
and always providing the option of making fine adjustments at any time if
needed. with these built-in for one or both mirrors.
<p>
When actually adjusting the mount, no single screw should be so excessively
tight that there is a chance of liberating the mirror mount from the rest of
the tube!  The entire useful range is only a fraction of a turn of each
screw.  If you are headed that way (or the mirror mount is sitting at a 20
degree angle), it will need to be moved into a initial position (using one
of the other tools described above) before the three-screw adjuster can be
safely used.  Adding a tiny drop of penetrating oil to each of the screws
and its contact point will minimize the tendency to of the screw to 'stick'
thus easing adjustments.  Once you have found the best setting, incrementally
snug up each of the screws so they are all applying at least a little
pressure to the mirror plate.  This will maximize long term stability.
<p>
CAUTION: Use a well insulated tool (hex wrench) to avoid a shocking
experience!!
<p>
However, the use of such drastic measures may be gross overkill for use
with these small inexpensive HeNe tubes unless you have a machinist sitting
around with nothing to do. :)

<h3><A NAME="htrsiap">Sam's Instalign(tm) Procedure for Internal Mirror Tube
 Mirror Alignment</A></h3>

The following is a quick way of checking and correcting the alignment of
internal mirror HeNe and Ar/Kr ion laser tubes if the bore is precisely
centered with respect to the envelope.  Centering is usually pretty good on
newer tubes but I've seen a some older ones where it was off by a good fraction
of a millimeter.
<p>
The idea is to roughly center the beam of an Alignment Laser (A-Laser) in
the bore and then rotate the Tube Under Test (TUT) to check for wobble in
the reflection back to the A-Laser's aperture.  Where the bore is centered,
any shift in the position of the reflection will be due to the misalignment
of the mirror.

<ul>
<li>Set up your TUT on a pair or V-blocks about one tube length from the
 A-Laser, which can be almost any type as long as it is reasonably well
 collimated - HeNe, diode, argon ion, etc.
<p>
<li>Align the TUT and A-Laser so that the A-Laser's beam is centered on the
 TUT-s mirror and reflects back to its aperture centered or just off of center.
<p>
<li>Without moving the TUT lengthwise, rotate it on the V-blocks and watch the
 reflected spot on the A-Laser's aperture.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>On a perfectly aligned mirror, the spot will remain in one position as
  you rotate the TUT.
<p>
 <li>Where there is misalignment, the spot will wobble back and forth as the
  TUT is rotated.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Where wobble of more than say, 1/2 mm is detected, first confirm that it
 isn't due to some other cause like a label on the TUT which shifts its
 position as it is rotated or its bore not being centered (and the original
 mirrors having been aligned to the bore).  If you are sure the offset is not
 due to one of these causes, use one of the mirror adjustment tools (or tweak
 the set screws if your laser has them) to reduce the wobble to zero.  In
 other words, rotate the TUT so the beam is at its maximum offset and bend
 the mirror to return it to halfway between the max and min.  Repeat the
 procedure zero in on the optimal setting.
<p>
 With a bit of luck this will be sufficient to now allow gentle rocking of the
 mirror to result in a beam.  With more luck, you will have a beam the instant
 power is applied! :)
</ul>

I've used this approach successfully on HeNe tubes up to about 20" in length
(so far).  It is particularly effective where only one mirror is misaligned
since the result will be close enough to use minimal force in rocking the
mirrors to find the precise setting.  Add-on adjusters or locking collars will
then be sufficient to fine tune it.

<h3><A NAME="htrsema">Sam's Approach for Aligning an External Mirror Laser
 with the Mirrors in Place</A></h3>

Here is a quick procedure for aligning an external mirror laser where the
area between the mirrors and Brewster windows is at least a couple of inches
long and accessible.
<p>
As with most of the other techniques, this one requires an Alignment Laser,
preferably a well collimated HeNe laser of a different wavelength than the
laser being aligned but a same color laser can be used though the transmitted
beam will be much weaker.

<ul>
<li>Rigidly mount and align the A-Laser to the bore of the Laser Under
 Test (LUT) with the LUT's OC-end facing the A-Laser (the OC will pass more
 light where the two lasers are the same wavelength and is thus makes the
 procedure easier).
<p>
<li>Adjust the OC mirror so that the reflection of the A-Laser's beam is
 centered in the A-Laser's output aperture.
<p>
<li>Position an opaque white card with a hole the size of the A-Laser's beam
 next to the HR-Brewster window so that the A-Laser's beam passes cleanly
 through the hole.  Use a stable third hand. :)
<p>
<li>Adjust the HR-Mirror so its reflection of the A-Laser beam also passes
 cleanly through the hole.  The scatter from these two beams should also
 appear on the Brewster window and should coincide.  Fine tune the HR to make
 it so.
<p>
<li>Move the card and third hand (or use a second set) to a position next
 to the OC-Brewster window, again with the A-Laser's beam centered in the
 hole..  There should be some evidence of the reflection from the HR mirror on
 the card.  Fine tune the HR mirror so it is centered.  Similarly, fine tune
 the HR mirror so that the scatter of the two beams on the OC Brewster window
 coincide.
<p>
<li>When alignment approaches perfection (adusting either mirror), you should
 see an increase in brightness of the scatter off the Brewster windows
 indicating that the beam (even if it is quite weak) is bouncing back and
 forth a few times at least.  If the LUT is powered up, there should be
 flashes at this point as well and further alignment can be done by optimizing
 output power by walking the mirrors.
</ul>

Using this approach, I can replace and align either mirror in a low gain HeNe
laser with a 15" resonator (see <A HREF="twobrew1.gif">HeNe Laser Tube with
Two Brewster Windows Mounted in Home-Built Resonator</A>) in under 5 minutes
assuming the A-Laser is still in place and aligned with the LUT's bore.

<h3><A NAME="htrmir5">Quick Course in Fine Tuning a Large Frame HeNe
 Laser</A></h3>

This is an abbreviated version of the procedures discussed in the section:
<A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrail">External Mirror Laser Cleaning and Alignment
Techniques</A>.  It applies to external mirror HeNe, Ar/Kr ion, and other
similar gas lasers.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).) 
<p>
Get an analog power meter in front of the laser before doing this.  You must
be able to see the changing trends in the power output.  This assumes clean
optics and a good tube at proper current levels.
<p>
WARNING: This procedure is not for the timid, easily distracted, or faint of
heart!
<p>
When tuning a laser, you work with either the verticals or the horizontals,
but never both at the same time. Failure to do this makes it easy for you
to misalign yourself into non lasing in a fraction of turns on the adjustments.
<p>
Start with the verticals, pick a direction for the front screw to turn,
either left or right, detune the laser power by about 30% , then go to the
rear VERTICAL screw and peak the power, Leaving the HORIZONTAL screw
UNTOUCHED. If the power is greater after peaking then before, keep going
in the same direction till it falls off then go back to the peak, and then
keep going the other direction, doing the same simple process of slightly
detuning, peaking and measuring. If you write down your power meter
readings, you will get the idea and will be able to find the vertical sweet
spot. You are scanning the cavity lasing path across the bore. 
<p>
Then do the horizontals, same procedure, pick a direction, slightly detune,
peak with the other mirror, etc.
<p>
Note: this is the short version of this. On most larger lasers, you would move
the front and rear mirrors the same direction by about the same amount.
However since this is a large frame HeNe, different rules apply, It usually
takes a large frame HeNe about 2 to 3 minutes to settle down after a
adjustment is changed, keep this in mind and go slow.
<p>
This is a iterative process, you have to repeat the steps many times on
both the horizontal and vertical axis till you have the exact peak, if you
have one of the many lasers (e.g., argon lasers like the Lexel, Ionics, 60X)
that stresses the Brewster stems when adjusting the mirrors, make sure the
Brewster covers are off or relaxed.  
<p>
Digital power meters take too long to update when tuning a laser, making
it easy to scan past the exact peak. and you can't see which way you are
going, it is very important to use a wide scale analog meter.  

<h3><A NAME="htrdmim">Daniel's Methods for Internal Mirror HeNe Tube Mirror
 Alignment</A></h3>

(From: Daniel Ames (dlames3@msn.com).)
<p>
The following notes are what I observed and used successfully for aligning a 
5 to 7 mW red HeNe laser with another red HeNe laser.  (In addition to the
procedure that follows, there is a simpler one using three HeNe tubes - (1)
a laser to produce a beam for alignment, (2) the tube needing alignment, and
(3) an identical tube which is used for setting things up.  See:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrqesc">Now for the Quick and Easier Shortcut</A>.

<h4><A NAME="htrbasp">The Basic Procedure</A></h4>

Last night I was trying to fine tune the HR mirror on a 16 inch Melles Griot
HeNe internal mirror laser tube when suddenly, no more beam (ooops).  So now I
was starting to panic, because I needed to ship this laser tube the next day,
plus at the moment, the only working lasers that I have are other red HeNes.
<p>
For the procedure below, I used a 2 mW HeNe for the reference laser (R-Laser).
Thanks to the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking
and Correcting Mirror Alignment of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> I found and
read up on how to realign a red HeNe with no lasing occurring, with another red
HeNe.  Well I didn't have the time to construct a bore sight and mounting
block to (hopefully) get the R-Laser's beam positioned so that when
the TNA (Tube Needing Alignment) was installed into the bore sight's mounting
blocks, the reference beam would shine directly on center and parallel to the
axis of the TNA's bore.
<p>
So I decided to improvise, using a HeNe tube I had laying around which has
Brewster windows for use with external mirrors to substitute for the TNA and
mounted it on my previously made alignment platform.  This tube is virtually
the same diameter as the TNA and could thus be swapped for it with its bore
in the same location.  With no mirrors, the red beam easily pass through it
permit accurate alignment.
<p>
Note: (If you have a dead HeNe tube of the same diameter. you could pull the 
mirrors off and use it for a bore sight, (but first, read the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My Tube is Good?</A>).  And,
be advised that the "god of dead lasers" could become very upset with you,
plus Sam and myself both agree that this would be sacrilegious) so you will
have to make some type of atonement with the laser gods.  Maybe, resurrect
two other helpless laser tubes for each one used for this purpose. :-)
<p>
The TNA and this special HeNe that I used, are the same diameter (+ or -
a few .001"s).  This allowed me to align the mirrorless tube (MT) with the
reference beam right down the center of its bore (with the two Brewster
windows facing upwards), with a very clean red spot exiting the rear Brewster
window.
<p>
Next, I carefully removed the MT and without moving the alignment platform,
installed the TNA.  Of course, the centering of the reference beam was off
axis slightly (on the vertical plane) due to the MT's Brewster window's index
of refraction. But this didn't matter in this case, even with  the the
curvature of the internal reflecting surfaces of both lasers' OCs, because the
outer reflecting surfaces of both OCs were flat and parallel.  So I used the
small reflected spot for reflection alignment, not the larger one caused by
the curved internal reflecting surfaces of the OCs.
<p>
I chose to use the OC mirror-end on the TNA for reflection alignment back to
the R-Laser's OC for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>When you get the TNA OC aligned so that it's reflected spot is centered in
 the R-Laser's beam and producing interference patterns dancing around in the
 spot, you are then ready to power up the TNA to see if it will actually
 produce a beam.  If it does, (good job!) now you can use the TNA's beam to
 align it with the R-Laser's beam (providing you have two power supplies).
 (This took me approximately 20 minutes at the most for the initial alignment
 of the TNA's OC once the R-Laser's beam was aligned down the center of the
 TNA's bore, and yes, it did actually produce a beam.
<p>
 But even if you only have one power supply, I found it a good idea to use the 
 TNA's OC for reflection alignment instead of the HR mirror because if during
 the fine tuning of the TNA, it happens to get so far off alignment to where
 there is no longer a beam and you haven't yet moved either the reference beam
 or the alignment platform, than you can save a lot of time by not having to
 set everything up  all over again!
<p>
<li>The OC has a higher (%) of transmission and by aligning the reference
 laser's beam right down the center of the TNA I found using a white or
 fluorescent orange sticker behind the rear HR mirror that there was still a
 small amount of the R-Laser's beam getting through the OC and a weak
 smaller diameter spot to exit the rear HR mirror of the TNA.
<p>
 Although it shouldn't make any difference as to the amount of light from the 
 R-Laser actually getting through the HR and OC mirrors on the TNA tube
 reguardless of which end of the tube the beam enters, what I discovered is
 that by shining the R-Laser beam into the OC-end of the TNA, you will see a
 faint "halo" around the faint dot of the R-Laser's beam. This was very helpful
 in centering the two axis of the cavities bores.  (This probably has to do
 with the curvature or the OC spreading the beam slightly inside the bore.
 --- Sam.)
<p>
 When shining the R-Laser beam into the HR of the TNA, there was no detectable
 halo even at only 1" behind the OC mirror.  Plus, as Steve Roberts mentioned,
 by using a bright orange (or red) fluorescent sticker to view the beam (but in
 this case, the one exiting the TNA), you can see the faint patterns or optical
 deviations during alignment much more easily. This is very helpful in this
 procedure as the amount of light from the R-Laser beam actually getting
 through the TNA's optics is very small.  A darkened, but safe place to work,
 is advisable for this method.
<p>
 Note: I used a 13" long Melles Griot tube that was already aligned and lasing
 well just for testing this procedure.  When I got the TNA tube aligned and
 centered with the reference beam, I could actually see the tiny dot of light
 that exited the TNA and dancing with its optical interference. You want to get
 more than just any dot exiting the HR mirror of the TNA, what you want to do,
 is keep fine tuning the alignment of the reference beam with the TNA, until
 you see the brightest dot & centered in the halo.
</ol>

<h4><A NAME="htrqesc">Now for the Quick and Easier Short Cut</A></h4>

As long as you have two identical tubes (diameter wise) and one is already 
lasing well, and providing that the OCs do not have a "wedge mirror" (see 
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henwbc3">Ghost Beams From HeNe Laser Tubes</A>,
then you actually could save a lot of time by not having to align the reference
beam exactly down the TNA's bore. 
<p>
What I did: I used the The Lasing Tube (TLT) in the alignment jig as the
substitute for the TNA. Then, I just aligned it with the R-Laser's
beam until I got the reflected and "round" spot centered and with the
reference beam. I was viewing the reflected larger spot on the TNA substitute
tube. If the larger reflected spot is oval shaped the you need to re-center
the reference beam with the center of the TNA's OC mirror.  Once this is done,
you could be home free for the initial dual alingment.
<p>
Then, replace the TLT with the TNA and don't move the alignment.  With the OCs
facing each other, if the reflected spots are not centered, just dial in the
reflected spot from the R-Laser to center itself with it's larger and small
reflections.  There should be a lot of optical interference now - dancing or
flickering.  If the spots are centered and round, then there is a good chance
that this mirror on the TNA does not need adjusting at this point, so turn the
TNA around and repeat the above procedure, then power it up.  If all went well,
it will be lasing somewhat.  Then, only fine tuning will be required.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir1">Minor Problems with Mirror
Alignment</A>.  Now you can fine tune the alignment of whichever mirror needed
original adjustments. 

<h4><A NAME="htrnovs">Notes on Viewing the Spot</A></h4>

One method that I have not seen anywhere on the Web, for fine tuning any
laser's beam without the professional and high dollar alignment equipment is
the following (I tried it and found it very helpful):
<p>
Just getting a laser to produce a beam, after realigning the optics as you 
know, is really only step one, but getting the optics (fine tuned) is another 
step. Sure you could just try to adjust by the brightness, but who wants to 
stare at a bright laser spot continuously.  And, if one doesn't have a power
meter, here is what I did.
<p>
I used a clean lens {concave/concave, at a distance greater than the lens's 
reflected focal length, to eliminate reflected interference patterns on the 
OC and back through the lens}, in front of the OC with the beam centered in
the lens and with a white piece of paper at a close enough distance from the
laser for visual clarity, (my setup was 4 feet).
<p>
By using a lens with an appropriate focal length, the beam's spot was spread to
about 3" in diameter which made it much easier to see variations in the beam
and it's  patterns as the optics were adjusted, or even just with a slight
amount of pressure on them.  Of course, a laser power meter would be a good
substitute and helpful, but not everyone has one.  The lens's focal length and
the distance between the laser's OC & the viewing paper are variable.
<p>
I have fixed (realigned) many HeNe tubes that were not lasing at all to start
with. But now, I definitely find it much easier to fine tune them using the
lens to widen the spot.  Then I watch the outside edges for rings and off
center irregularities.  Argon ion laser tubes are also very difficult if they
are not lasing at all, but at least on many of them, their mirror mounting
plates are easier to apply pressure to at the X-X, Y-Y, and Z-Z axis and all
combinations, to see if you're not to far off and which way.  This would
apply, for example, to NEC tubes though Cyonics/Uniphase types use HeNe style
mirror mounts.

<h4><A NAME="htrnoaj">Notes on the Alignment Jig</A></h4>

I found that with my homemade alignment jig, similar to the one discussed in
the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir4">Simple Adjustable Optics
Platform</A> but much heavier and with two horizontal adjustment screws, it
was actually easier to mount the TNA on it and leave the R-Laser stationary.
I don't really know if the leverage of the geometry works out any different,
but it appeared to be much easier to make the vertical and horizontal
adjustment.  But of course this will depend on your alignment jig's design
plus, how stationary it is and your preferences.

<h3><A NAME="htrdmem">Daniel's Method for Aligning External Mirror
 Lasers</a></h3>

This was written for HeNe lasers using a dual Brewster window plasma tube
and external mirrors.  Some slight modification will be needed for single
Brewstered tubes or other gas lasers.
<p>
The following assumed that you have a setup consisting of a Reference Laser
(R-Laser (a HeNe laser is assumed since for aligning a HeNe laser, that is
the toughest as the wavelengths are the same.  The laser being aligned
consists of the Tube Under Test (TUT) and the resonator with the external
adjustable mirrors (front and rear).  The pinholes are aids to alignment.
<PRE>

   +---------+    |                     |                       |
   | R-Laser |==> :            ||       :     /===========\     :       )|
   +---------+    |                     |          TUT          |
               R-Laser       Front    Front     (Removed)     Rear     Rear
               Pinhole       Mirror  Pinhole                 Pinhole  Mirror
</PRE>

Where the R-Laser and TUT are of difference wavelengths, overall difficulty
will be somewhat reduced as more light will get through the front mirror.
For more on the alignment jig and related topics, see the sections starting
with: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrdmim">Daniel's Methods for Internal Mirror HeNe
Tube Mirror Alignment</A> since much of the setup is similar.
<p>
Note: One assumption made here for the procedure below to work properly is
that the Brewster windows on the TUT are of high quality plane parallel
optical glass or quartz and are set at equal and opposite angles (/=====\ NOT
\=====\).  This should be the case with most commercial tubes.  However, if
these conditions aren't met, there can be a slight shift in position and/or
angle of the beam passing through the tube's bore which would mean that
aligning the resonator mirrors with the tube removed would NOT result in
exactly the same adjustment settings once the tube is replaced.
<p>
(From: Daniel Ames (dlames3@msn.com).)
<p>
Note: since not all HeNe laser tubes follow the same design, ideally the way
you want to orient the resonator's optics is to have the curved mirror for
the TUT furthest away from the R-Laser. If this turns out to be the TUT's OC 
mirror that's all the better, since we will be looking for the reference
beam's reflection from this rear mirror to align it back through the pin
holes within the cavity.  Either mirror as the rear mirror will work for
this method, but I prefer to use the curved mirror since it will counteract
the (+) divergence of the reference beam.
<p>
First determine which mirror is the [curved] one, simply by observing the 
reflection of the R-Laser's beam from the two surfaces of each individual
mirror.  On the curved mirror end of the TUT's resonator, place a white or 
fluorescent orange card between the Brewster window and it's related 
optic,  then take your strongest Hene and shine it through (from the outside) 
of this mirror, then dim the lights and see if you can see the beam on the 
target paper. Chances are, you will, faintly. If so, then you can use a HeNe 
to align a HeNe. Sounds impossible, but it is NOT as I have actually done 
it and succeeded with this using only a 5 mW HeNe laser - HeNe to HeNe.
<p>
Note: Some pinholes are helpful.  Three (3) pinholes, just barely larger in
diameter than the R-Laser's beam would be ideal, unless one has a very
symmetrical eye.  But at least one pinhole is a must for within the
resonator's cavity.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>One pinhole would be placed in at the center of the TUT's first mirror
  on the (inside) of the resonator since we are using such a reduced power
  reference beam.  This is called the 'Front Pinhole'.
 <p>
 <li>The second is placed about an inch away from the TUT's rear mirror,
  again, on the inside of the cavity and about an inch away from the mirror.
  This is called the 'Rear Pinhole'.
 <p>
 <li>The third (optional, but very helpful pinhole) would be placed in front
  of the R-Laser's OC and centered with the beam.  This is called the
  'R-Laser Pinhole'.
 </ul>
<p>
Remove the TUT from the resonator and align the R-Laser's beam right down the
optical center of the mirrors starting at the curved mirror, (hopefully it's
the HR).
<p>
Now, we are ready for the actual alignment.  This part is even easier if the
mirrors are easily removable.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alignment Step #1</b>: Adjust the first mirror of the TUT's
 resonator, (the one closest to the R-Laser), until it's second (inside)
 surface reflection is centered inside the R-Laser's pinhole and producing
 interference patterns (resulting from light bouncing back and forth between
 the R-Laser's OC and the front mirror of the resonator).
<p>
 Also look at the pinhole just inside the TUT's first optic, the reflected 
 beam from the R-Laser's OC should be fine tuned to be concentric with the 
 first pinhole inside the TUT resonator.
<p>
<li><b>Alignment Step #2</b>: Check the original reference beam's position
 with respect to the resonator's rear inside pinhole. If nothing has moved,
 then it should still be passing right through the pin hole.  It is?  Good
 job!
<p>
<li><b>Alignment Step #3</b>: Ignore the R-Laser's secondary reflected
 beam and use the R-Laser's original beam to align the two optics within the
 resonator by first adjusting the rear optic's alignment until it's reflected
 beam is concentrically passing through the rear internal pin hole, then fine
 tune this rear adjustment until it also passes cleanly through the front
 internal pin hole.
<p>
<li><b>Alignment Step #4</b>: Look at the first surface of the first
 internal pin hole to see if the reflected spot is visible, or passing again
 right through this pinhole.  If it is to the side of this pin hole, I would
 recommend (only) adjusting (fine tuning) the rear mirror's position, not the
 first mirror.
<p>
<li><b>Alignment Step #5</b>: Finally, now that the two optics are
 aligned, install the TUT and without touching the mirror adjustments, just
 position the tube so that its cavity allows the R-Laser's original beam to
 pass cleanly through it.  If your brave enough to power up the tube, while
 adjusting it's position, then when you get it concentrically aligned with
 the optical axis of the (previously adjusted mirrors) it should lase and
 save the planet (at the very least), all at the same time! :)

<h3><A NAME="htrfcma">Flavio's Comments on HeNe Tube Mirror Alignment</A></h3>

(Portions from: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
Below is a simple diagram that shows the end configuration of a typical
internal mirror laser tube:
<p>
<PRE>
       \

	--|  |_|  |-

</PRE>
<p>
The end of the mount is divided in two with a gap between the first and second
sections.  At the time of manufacture, HeNe laser tubes are aligned for
optimum power output.
<p>
On some HeNe tubes (as well as internal mirror argon ion laser tubes), this
gap may me covered by a ring with three (3) adjustment 'grub' screws as
shown below:
<p>
<PRE>
       \     ___

</PRE>
<p>
Or see A HREF="3slcmg1.jpg">Three-Screw Locking Collars on Melles Griot HeNe
Laser Tubes</A> for photos.
<p>
If the tube has the metal ring with the grub screws, some people have been
tempted to re-adjust this - very BIG mistake.. and the reason is this:
With the ring in place and the screws tight and sealed from the factory, the
whole assembly is very solid.  Now, if you try to re-adjust the grub
screws, trying to extract more power, more than likely you will throw
out the entire tube out of alignment. The screws are so tight, that very
slight, and gentle and precise alignment is very difficult to achieve.
<p>
For tubes that DO NOT have this assembly, once the mirrors are out of
alignment, it is extremely difficult to re-align the tube.  Been there,
done that. :(
<p>
Now, the reason that there are troubles with realigning a tube so it is stable
are two-fold:
<ol>
<li>Mirror mounts are very difficult to physically change position (very
 slight movements) and maintain that position.  You are physically bending
 metal so it is easy to overshoot the desired position.  In addition, the
 mount will not relax to its final position and stay there - there may be some
 drift or creep over time especially after multiple thermal cycles.
<p>
<li>Heat - even if the tube is only on for a few seconds, the very slight
 temperature differences can be enough to change the mirror alignment.  At the
 factory, the alignment is optimized after a warmup of 30 minutes or more and
 minimum output power is usually specified after a similar period of time.
</ol>
In some older HeNe tubes, I have seen the affects of thermal expansion,
the beam will drift in and out of alignment, and this start to occur
only after about 5 to 10 sec after power-up.
<p>
WARNING: All the adjustments that you do on the tube, unfortunately have to be
done while the tube is powered up - so you have at least one end of the tube
(usually the anode) floating at 2 kV or more once the tube is running (and even
after power down due to tube and power supply capacitance).  If during your
adjustments, the tube decides to drop out, and re-start, you will have the
8 to 15 kV starting voltage - so please be very careful!
<p>
As the tube is powered, try and push the mirror mount, and watch the
beam, once you get a nice bright output, try and hold that position, and
see if it will hold the output as you support that position - Note in
which direction / movement you used to achieve this.
<p>
If you have the ring/grub screw assembly, moving one of the screws will not
necessarily adjust the mirror in the direction that you want, so you may have
to use different adjustment/pressures on all three screws.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
If the alignment is nearly correct - gentle force or just touching the mirror
mount results in full power - I would suggest as an alternative: Instead of
actually attempting to bend the mount, add an external 3 screw adjuster to
the problem mirror mount.  This will operate within the elastic limit of the
mounts so the risk of breaking them off from repeated unsuccessful attempts
at bending them back and forth is eliminated.  Let the tube warm up for at
least 30 minutes, then gently adjust the screws to optimize power output.

<h3><A NAME="htrdgma1">Dave's General External Mirror Alignment
 Techniques</A></h3>

(From: Dave (Ws407c@aol.com).)
<p>
This is my new method of laser alignment.  This works well for most
narrow bore HeNe and ion lasers.  As of today, it is the best yet. :-)
<p>
Ever hold a HeNe or other laser tube in your hand and just hold it up to 
your eye and sight through the bore and look at something across the room and 
target it? Quite easy to repeat.  I always wished I could shine a laser beam
down the same tube with the same accuracy and speed. Especially when trying
to align a laser!!  I have  aligned quite a few lasers over the years via this 
same tedious method and to be frank, I am sick of it. :-) In the beginning of 
the hobby I really enjoyed doing  this and worked it down to a science but it 
is still a pain , all that laser  light splashing all over the place , fiber 
optic effect of the light zig-zaging  back and forth the bore etc. Well this 
method works for me and I'm sticking with  it :-)
<p>
You will need:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Single thin filament light bulb (not too bright).
<li>Glass slide (as beamsplitter).
<li>White LED flashlight (or LED of the proper color for the laser you are
 aligning).
<li>A pair of Vaccuvice(tm) 3rd hands.
</ul>
<p>
Here is the procedure:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove OC and place light bulb locked in the 3rd hand 8" to 14"  in front 
 of the laser where you removed the mirror.
<p>
<li>Look through the HR and down the bore, and line up the bulb filament so
 it is centered, this should be quick and easy. :-)  In my case laser is on
 my right pointing left at the bulb on my left, lined up.
<p>
<li>Hold LED flashlight (diffuse source) through HR down the bore.
<p>
<li>Place glass slide (beamsplitter) between bulb and laser and orient  at 45 
 degrees so you can sight the LED flashlight, again real quick and easy.  :-) 
 Lock in place with 3rd hand, or in this case with 4th hand. :-)
<p>
<li>While looking through the slide, twist HR mirror mount adjustments til
 you see the bulb filament through the slide, center it, done. Again quick
 and easy. :-)
<p>
<li>Remount OC, fire up laser and fish for the beam, your  done.
</ol>
<p>
I like this method because all critical alignment is accurately sighted
directly and quickly by eye.  This satisfies my natural wanting to look
directly down the bore and immediately align the mirror directly by eye. :-)
<p>
I can't believe I  haven't tried this before.
<p>
I read the HeNe laser in SciAm and it is pretty much the same setup, but
they do not mention to shroud the Brewsters which helps greatly to maximize
the contrast.  Shrouding the SP-907's Brewsters made it a snap. :-)  Yup,
tried it a couple of times on the SP-907 and it works awesome.  I use 1
steering mirror with the 907 for the tube is too long and this way I sit
at the HR-end and tweak while looking down to the mirror.

<h3><A NAME="htrdqma2">Dave's Quickie External Mirror Alignment
 Technique for the SP-120</A></h3>

The following works for the Spectra-Physics model 120 and other lasers with
spherical OCs where the optics and machining are most excellent.  Interchange
OC and HR in the procedure below if your laser only has a spherical HR.  I
doubt it would work reliably depending only on close tolerances for a planar
mirror.
<p>
(From: Dave (Ws407c@aol.com).)
<p>
As far as the terrible 3 point mirror mounts on the SP-120, I have developed a
way to get the mirrors aligned without any cards or another laser. Just my 
two hands and a hex wrench.  Within 5 minutes I get it every time. :-)
I have also been applying this technique to the longer lasers with some good 
results.
<p>
As you know, if one mirror is aligned correctly, the other is a cinch. I
tighten down the OC and then back off each screw 3/4th of a turn.  Then I
loosen up the HR so it has a lot of play.  I put my finger over the HR and
wiggle in a repeating all over the place while hunting for a flash out of
the OC.  When I get a repeatable flash on the OC that's it, no problem to
tweak in the HR. Works every time on the SP-120. :-)

<h3><A NAME="htrdpma1">Dave's Preferred External Mirror Alignment
 Technique for Long Lasers</A></h3>

For this procedure, both mirrors are left in place.  The OC of the Laser Under
Alignment (LUA) is facing a Reference Laser (Ref-L).  Note that like many of
the other techniques, this does require that the Ref-L's beam is sufficiently
narrow and collimated that it can get through the LUA's bore with at most
minimal wall contact.  To what extent this is possible will depend both on
the beam characteristics of the Ref-L and the curvature of the LUA's HR (which
affects the size/divergence of the reflected beam).
<p>
<ol> 
<li>Set up the Ref-L on a scissor lift with XY adjustment and the aperture 
 of Ref-L and LUA approximately 6" apart.  For aligning a red HeNe, the
 Ref-L should be some other wavelength like green which will pass more
 easily through both of the LUA mirrors.
<p> 
<li>On opposite end of LUA, a convex lens is held in a "3rd 
 hand" projecting onto a white card or the wall to expand the emerging beam
 to say an inch or more so you can see what you are doing way over on the
 other end of the setup while getting the Ref-L perfectly aligned with
 the bore.
<p> 
<li>Once the bore is perfectly aligned, insert a glass slide held in another
 "3rd hand" in between the lasers and reflect the light coming from the laser
 to be aligned up onto the ceiling or wall or screen.
<p>
<li>What you will see reflected if the LUA is totally out of alignment are
 two spots reflected back from the OC: The mirror surface (bright spot) and
 the AR-coated surface (dim spot).
 <p> 
<li>Pick an axis and rack this mirror (OC) a few turns to get its reflections
 out of the way.
<p>
<li>Take a walk to the other end of the laser and start twisting the HR mount 
 till you get a 3rd spot projected on the ceiling (preferably over the center 
 of the laser. :)  Center this spot for a good clear round spot and if there
 is some scatter lopsided about this spot, it is OK (bore is slightly out).
 You want the spot to be round and clear.
<p> 
<li>The best part: Superimpose the bright OC spot over the HR spot and 
 suddenly there will be an eruption of laser light from the laser that was
 out of alignment. :-)
</ol>
<p> 
This procedure is nice and easy to perform but even better, REAL EASY to SEE
what's going on - no squinting down the bore to look for a light bulb you
can't reach. :-)

<h3><A NAME="htrcats">Cat's Eye Mirror for Hassle-Free Alignment</A></h3>

Haven't you always dreamed of just dropping the mirrors into an external
mirror laser cavity, power up, and have the laser operating at near optimal
performance without ever touching an alignment screw?  Well, there is a
relatively simple optics configuration that has the potential to make this
possible
<p>
While many large bore lasers like the M60 Tank ruby rangefinder laser have
used optical roof prisms or even corner cube reflectors for the HR, this isn't
practical for narrow bore HeNe and ion lasers.  Wny?  Well, for one thing,
no roof prism or corner cube has perfect edges so there will be some scatter
in the region where they are - but for a laser with a 1 mm diameter
beam, that's a relatively large percentage of the mode cross-section
and effectively kills lasing.
<p>
However, there is a combination of a curved mirror and convex lens called
"cat's eye" due to its similarity to the arrangement in, well, a cat's eye.
This behaves much like a corner cube reflector but without its
problems (at least over a small angle).  Rays entering the lens will be
reflected directly back in the direction they came, at least close to
the optic axis for small angles.  The optimal arrangement has
an AR coated convex lens placed at one focal length (f) from a mirror with
an RoC of f, coated as an HR or OC for the laser wavelength.  In principle,
any narrow beam laser could benefit from this.  The cat's eye reflector
has been tested with HeNe lasers but would certainly work as well for
other narrow bore lasers - which are those creating the most problems
with mirror alignment.  Of course, the manufacturing cost would be higher
but how much is your time and sanity worth? :)
<p>
Apparently, using such a setup allows the mirror assembly to be held by
hand or with a pair of tweezers and get stable lasing.  Now, I can do
this with my 1-B HeNe laser tubes and a normal HR or OC, the cat's eye
makes it even easier.  ;-)  Of perhaps more importance, since angular
sensitivity of the mirror is greatly reduced, it would be possible to say
goodbye to the annoying power drift due to alignment changing that often
occurs as the laser warms up.
<p>
This was presented in the paper:
"Adjustment-free cat's eye cavity He-Ne laser and its outstanding stability",
Zhiguang Xu, Shulian Zhang, Yan Li, and Wenhua Du, 2005 Optical Society of
America, Optics Express, vol. 13, no. 14, pp. 5565-5573, 11-July-2010.
<p>
Here is the abstract (spelling and grammer NOT corrected):
<p>
<blockquote>
 "This paper introduces an innovative He-Ne laser which exhibits many
 advantages to current He-Ne lasers. With cat's eye reflector as the
 reflecting mirror, the new laser can solve the conventional problems
 of laser adjustment and power stability. Comprehensive experiments are
 carried out both in a half-external cavity and a full-external cavity
 He-Ne laser. Then the results from the cat's eye cavity, plane-concave
 mirror cavity and concave-concave mirror cavity are compared, which
 show that in halfe-xternal cavity laser, cat's eye cavity can improve
 the laser stability up to 10 times better than other cavities and
 lower the power drift significantly. And in the full-external case the
 improvements are much greater even up to 60 times and power drift is
 minished greatly too. The adjustment problem is also considered and
 solved. A stable and adjustment-free He-Ne laser is finally
 realized. The examination of a cat's eye reflector is described."
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, while it's quite likely that the benefits of the cat's eye configuration
were recognized long ago, the added complexity and cost - and especially
the losses through the AR coated lens -  would likely have prevented it from
even becoming widely used.  Only with a very long HeNe laser like a Melles
Griot 05-LHR-927 or Spectra-Physics 127 would those losses be relatively
small compared to the gain.  But even so, would still result in a significant
reduction in power, not to mention the issues of making sure 2 additional
optical surfaces are perfectly clean.  One way around the loss problem might
be to use an aspherical HR mirror reflecting off-axis to the spherical
cavity mirror instead of a convex lens, but then the cost of manufacturing
that very special mirror would probably be totally ridiculous.
<p>
My question - which I'm not sure is answered in the paper - is: What happens
if cat's eye reflectors are used at both ends of the laser?  Is the thing
then totally self-aligning? :)

<h3><A NAME="htrmaop">Mirror Alignment with just an Optical Power
 Meter</A></h3>

Here's a way of aligning mirrors very quickly on small to medium length
external mirror (one and two-Brewster) lasers.  With care, it may work on
large frame lasers as well.  This approach takes advantage of the fact that
the far mirror will be aligned when maximum bore light is returned to the
front of the tube.  Unlike the laser wavelength, most bore light passes
through the mirror and there is ample power to monitor.  It works great
on one-Brewster HeNe lasers as well as the very difficult to align PMS
LSTP-0010 and LSTP-1010 tunable HeNe lasers.  I would recommend it only
for lasers with screw adjustable mounts, not for HeNe laser tubes with
three-screw locking collars or less.
<p>
All that is needed is an optical power meter (laser, photographic,
etc.) with enough sensitivity to respond well to the bore light.
One with a "suppression range" feature is best but this is not
essential.  (The suppression range enables the constant light to
be cancelled out so that the sensitivity to changes can be increased.)
<p>
To align one mirror, place the sensor of the optical power meter at the
other end of the laser, located to pick up the bore light.  Set up the meter
on a range that allows the maximum deflection of the meter while keeping it
on scale, and/or set the suppression range to cancel out most of the
constant bore light.
<p>
Now all that's required is to twiddle (technical term!) the far mirror to
maximize the power reading.  With kinematic or gimbal mounts, this will
actually be quite easy.  The peak is broad so each axis will have an effect
even if the other axis is way off.  As the alignment approaches optimal,
the reading will increase and with a bit of luck, will then spike as lasing
occurs (assuming the other mirror was already aligned).
<p>
For a laser with two adjustable mirrors, just repeat the procedure for the
other mirror.
<p>
It takes literally only a couple of minutes to do this for a PMS tunable
laser (which uses a 1-B tube with permanently adjusted internal OC), which
with its narrow bore is very difficult to align with any of the other
techniques.

<h3><A NAME="htribhl">Inconsistent Behavior of HeNe Laser Alignment</A></h3>

With a healthy HeNe laser, the adjustment of mirror alignment will result
in behavior that is smooth and repeatable.  Except for the mode cycling
variations in output power, the result will be fairly stable even from
one power cycle to the next.  Even the very rudimentary adjustments using
the screws on Melles Griot locking collars perform generally in this way.
Unless....
<p>
You may come across a laser tube or head where <i>nothing</i> works as
expected.  After peaking power, the output may drop after a few minutes
such that adjustment is again needed.  After that, the same thing may
happen again.  And again.  The output power may be extremely sensitive
to mirror alignment even to the point were gently clamping the tube
in a head cylinder using the nylon screw may cut output power in half
or worse.  Or, supporting the tube at various points will significantly
affect it.  And just the weight of a popsicle stick on one of the mirror mounts
will change power significantly.  What's going on?
<p>
If the laser is from a surplus supplier or eBay, it's quite possible -
actually quite likely - that it was a reject, possibly due to a bad
design (yes laser designers make mistakes!) or improper
manufacturing.  In particular, if the mirror specifications were not
correct and matched to the bore, the stability of the resonator with
respect to the various modes could be so low that each one sees a
significantly different gain.  So, after optimizing one set of modes,
as they drift with respect to the gain curve, there could be very
significant power fluctuations.  Guess where such tubes end up? :)
<p>
Another possibility is contamination like a hair, fiber, or metal sliver,
inside the tube.  If it extends into the lasing mode volume (the intracavity
beam), then peculiar behavior could result, and could change with time,
orientation, vibration, etc.
<p>
The effects of IR (3.39 um) mode competition can appear similar but are
not likely to show up with most reasonably modern red (632.8 nm) HeNe
lasers, though they can be significant for "other-color" tubes.
<p>
I have several tubes that exhibit this sort of behavior.  One is a Melles
Griot 05-LHR-990, a 10 mW (rated) tube about 18 inches long.  It was
obtained in a batch of tubes I bought from one of the well
known laser surplus outfits mainly to salvage mirrors.  So this tube was
even considered a reject by them!  (It only cost me $2.)
The output power is extremely sensitive to any pressure on the mirror
mounts (even with the locking collars tight), pressure applied to the sides
of the tube with the nylon screws in the head cylinder, and temperature
gradients.  By adjusting the locking collars, it's possible to achieve
over 14 mW by careful tweaking.  However, after a few minutes, the power
declines to 12 or 13 mW and realignment of the mirrors at one or both ends
is required to get back to the high level.  The power is still well above
the spec'd value but the variation is annoying.  It's a nice tube otherwise. :)
<p>
Another Melles Griot tube I have with a similar but more severe symptoms is
also of similar size, though I don't know the exact model number.  It's
output can vary from 4 to 9 mW with almost no change in mirror alignment,
and may switch to a multi-transverse mode (TEM01/10 or something stranger)
at the lower powers.  I rather suspect that there may be something
somewhere in along the length of the bore or inside one of the mirror
mounts though I can't find it.  There <i>is</i> what looks like hair
stuck inside one of the mirror mounts but it doesn't extend anywhere
near the beam.  But, perhaps, it's buddy is hanging out somewhere else.

<h3><A NAME="htr907ca">Cleaning and Alignment of the Spectra-Physics 907 HeNe Laser</A></h3>

This is longest HeNe laser that had been available from Spectra-Physics (now
Newport) and the model 127 which uses this tube was listed on their Web site
and in the Edmunds catalog until recently.  However, many of these are
still available surplus either as the SP-127 or just the tube designated
907, 107, or the older 082.  The design hasn't changed noticeably in 25
years.
<p>
Unfortunately, one of the deficiencies of this laser is that the probability
of it remaining aligned during shipping, even if packed with 10 inches of
foam all around - is small.  Usually, it's just a slight power loss but I've
seen cases where there was no lasing at all and a full realignment was needed.
<p>
Being external mirror lasers with Brewster windows, the optics can get
dirty, especially if the rubber sealing boots at each end are cracked, as
some tend to be, possibly from overzealous removal by a previous user.

<h4><A NAME="htr907cas">Sam's Procedure and Comments</A></h4>

There are 4 sets of alignments in the SP-907 (listed in the order in which
they should be dealt with for a total realingment):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bore centering brackets at both ends.
<li>Coarse mirror adjustment nuts on the resonator.
<li>Fine mirror adjustment hex setscrews on the side of the mirror mounts.
<li>Bore centering adjustments about midway and near the anode-end of
 the tube.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Recommended cleaning</b>
<p>
None. :)  Actually, if the rubber boots are in good condition and sealing
well and there is no reason to suspect that someone before you has messed
with them, it's probably best to leave them in place and not to attempt
to clean the Brewster windows or mirrors, at least not until you're
determined to eak out the last few photons/second of performance.  But
here are some procedures that work:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mirrors:</b> Both mirrors are removable without major disassembly,
 though the ends of the SP-127 case will have to be taken off (4 screws
 each).  Generally, removing and replacing <i>the same</i> mirrors can be
 done without losing lasing on a system producing decent power.  However,
 if swapping mirrors from another laser, it may be necessary to either
 use an X-Y search procedure to regain lasing, or loosen the nuts entirely
 and look for flashes.  The HR mirror is planar but find ground on the
 outer surface.  This doesn't matter except perhaps when doing initial
 alignment using an alignment laser.  However, the planar HR mirror from
 another HeNe laser will work just fine in its place.  The diameter is the
 same as those used in most internal mirror HeNe lasers as well as other
 smaller Spectra-Physics lasers like the SP-120.
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Remove the aluminum locking ring with a suitable tool (e.g., a wide
  flat-blade screwdriver).
<p>
 <li>Remove the plastic sleeve and rubber O-ring using a toothpick or some
  other narrow tool that won't damage the mirror or mirror mount.  For the
  OC in particular, take care not to damage the AR coated outer surface in
  the process.  The HR is fine ground and can stand more abuse.
<p>
 <li>A 1/4" or so diameter plastic or rubber hose can be used to extract
  the mirror itself from the mount by sucking on it like a drinking straw
  or using a modest vacuum.  This is by far the easiest way to get these
  out.  DO NOT push them out from the inside - that is almost guaranteed
  to cause irreversible damage to the delicate mirror coating.  SP probably
  recommends masking tape on the end of a stick, but this may leave residue
  on the OC, which adds another step.
<p>
 <li>Inspect the mirror and clean it <i>using the proper laser mirror
  cleaning procedures</i> described in the section:
  <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrcln">Cleaning of Laser Optics</A>.  DO NOT
  touch the mirror surface!
<p>
 <li>For the OC, also clean the AR coated outer surface with alcohol and
  lens tissue.  It's better to do it now as effectively cleaning the mirror
  after installation.
<p>
 <li>Before replacing the mirrors, clean the inside of the mirror mount
  holes with a cotton swab and alcohol, taking care not to leave any fibers
  behind.
<p>
 <li>Replace the mirror by carefully positioning it just inside the hole
  in the mirror mount and slowly pushing it in place with a clean plastic
  post or other suitable tool that won't cause damage.  The mirror will tend
  to want to roll over until it is fully seated so go slow.
<p>
 <li>Replace the O-ring and push it in place.
<p>
 <li>Put the plastic sleeve into the locking ring and then screw the locking
  ring in until there resistance, back out a bit, and check and adjust the
  centering of the O-ring if necessary.  Then, tighten up the locking ring
  until it is just snug.
</ol>
<p>
<li><b>Brewster windows:</b>
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>For these, the boots will need to be pulled off of the mirror mounts.
  With care, the boots can be pushed back enough to allow access to the
  B-windows with a cotton swab.  Removing the boots entirely is possible
  but be aware that some of them are glued into place on the glass tube
  and they tend to tear if not removed very carefully.  In any case, it's
  usually counterproductive to remove them entirely since attempting to
  put them back in place after the Brewster windows have been cleaned will
  almost always dirty them up again!
<p>
 <li>The same laser mirror cleaning procedure can be used for the B-windows
  but I have found that a cotton swab is quite effective and quick.  If done
  while the laser is lasing, it's very easy to see whether it worked.
<p>
  Take a new cotton swab and put 1 drop of alcohol on it.  Swipe once
  across the B-window from the tip back.  If done properly (or with some
  skill and luck), the alcohol will dry within a second and the scatter
  off of the outer surface of the B-window will have decreased to the
  point where it is similar to that from the inner surface (which is about
  as good as it gets).  If not, take a new cotton swab and repeat.
  Reusing a cotton swab almost always makes things worse.
<p>
  If doing this with the laser unpowered or not lasing, a red or green laser
  pointer is an effective inspection tool as any contamination or debris will
  stand out like a beacon.  Also, if the pointer is held approximately at the
  Brewster angle with respect to the B-window and rotated until its
  polarization axis is aligned with it, there should be essentially no
  detectable reflection or scatter from a properly cleaned window.
<p>
  If the Brewster window is really dirty, some scrubbing with cotton swabs
  and alcohol may be needed before attempting the above procedures.
<p>
 <li>Once the B-window is clean, push the boot back in place as soon as
  possible to keep it that way.
 </ol>
<p>
  When operating at high power, there will be a slight glow inside the
  boot from residual scatter and the sub-mW reflections off the B-window.
  But if it looks like a bright red light bulb, debris has made its way
  back to the B-window and it will need to be cleaned again.
</ul>
<p>
As noted, put the boots back on as soon as possible as a gradual decline in
power is inevitable from from dust collecting on the B-windows and mirrors.
For a laser like this, even slight contamination not obvious by eye can result
in a power reduction of a few mW.
<p>
<b>Total alignment procedure</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bore-end adjustments:</b> This sets the ends of the tube to be centered
 in the mirrors.  There really aren't enough degrees of freedom to do this
 perfectly especially in the vertical direction but the precision of the
 machining seems to be close enough.  Note that in principle, it doesn't
 really matter as far as optimizing output power
 if the beam is off-center on the mirrors.  However, all mirrors
 tend to have "sweet spots" and the center may have very slightly better
 performance.  But in fact, it is not really known if the beam alignment
 with respect to the case is correct with the beam centered in the mirrors.
 While the mirror mounts are machined with the center in the same location
 for both OC and HR, with the Brewster windows offset in opposite directions
 as in the 907 tube, the beam would exit at a slight angle if everything else
 is also machined referenced to the same center.
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>With power OFF, sight down the bore from the
  HR (cathode) end.  If the bore is far off center with respect to the mirror,
  CAREFULLY loosen the pair of Philips screws holding the bore clamp in place
  just enough to allow the clamp to moved side-to-side and GENTLY adjust it
  to center the bore.  If there isn't enough range, don't worry about it.
  If it doesn't move easily, one or both of the hex screws holding the
  cathode glass bell in place may also need to be loosened.  DON'T FORCE
  ANYTHING!
<p>
  Since the beam diameter at the HR is much smaller than the diameter of
  the bore there due to the nearly hemispherical resonator configuration,
  this adjustment is not very critical at all as the mirror alignment alone
  will determine the beam location at the mirror.  Think of a cone with its
  apex just beyond the HR mirror.
<p>
 <li>With power OFF, sight down the bore from the OC (anode) end.  If the bore 
  isn't well centered in the mirror, CAREFULLY loosen the pair of Philips
  screws holding the bore clamp in place just enough to allow the clamp to
  moved and GENTLY adjust it to center the bore.
<p>
  This alignment is more important since the beam location on the mirror
  is determined mostly by the bore position and the clearance between the
  tails of the beam profile and aperture hole in the mirror retaining
  O-ring is not that large.
 </ol>
<p>
<li><b>Coarse mirror adjustment nuts:</b>
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Adjust the 4 fine adjust hex setscrews (2 on the side of each mirror
  mount (if present) until they are at least 1/2 turn beyond starting to
  to have some resistance to movement but not too tight.
<p>
  Note: Apparently some versions of these lasers do not have any fine
  adjustments for the mirrors.  If this is the case, all adjustments
  will need to be done with the coarse mirror adjustment nuts.
<p>
 <li>If starting from scratch, use an autocollimator or alignment laser to
  obtain first light.  When tightening the nuts, the best approach is to never
  lose lasing by going in very small increments.  However, if you feel lucky
  turning each nut by exactly the same amount (say 1/2 rotation) and then
  peaking output will probably work.  I've lost it entirely though a couple
  times when doing this.  If that happens, try pressing on the mirror mount
  in all directions and if that doesn't work, do a systematic search with the
  X-Y nuts.  If that doesn't work, you weren't lucky today.  Tighten until
  the screw rod end is approximately flush with the nut.
<p>
 <li>Initial mirror walking can be done using the X and Y nuts at each end.
  Some people prefer to do all mirror adjustment using the nuts.  With care
  and a long wrench, this is possible.  Just don't drop the wrench on the
  tube! :(
 </ol>
<p>
<li><b>Fine mirror adjustment hex setscrews (if present):</b> These provide
 more precise control of mirror alignment.  Whereas the nuts have a lasing
 range of less than 1/10 of a turn, the fine screws may be 1/4 to 1/3 of
 a turn.  But they tilt the mirrors along the diagonals
 rather than X and Y.  The top and bottom sets are the two pairs to be used.
 Walk each set independently.  There is also some interaction and considerable 
 hysteresis so it will be necessary to slowly go in one direction looking for
 the maximum power, then go back the other way until the same power is reached
 but not beyond.  Then do each set again.
<p>
<li><b>Bore centering adjustments:</b> There are two sets of four hex head
 screws that pull the bore slightly in X or Y to fine tune its straightness
 on the OC portion of the laser.  (The beam along the HR half of
 the laser is much smaller than the bore so centering isn't as critical there.)
 These are relatively coarse screws so it's not likely that more than
 one turn in either direction will be needed.
<p>
 CAUTION: The two screws for the two bore centering adjustments that need to
 be turned are readily visible in the open part of the resonator assembly.
 There are also similar screws accessible via holes in the L-shaped frame.
 These press against springs and provide the restoring force for the bore.
 It may be possible to tighten them far enough to hit the bore and possibly
 break it.  DO NOT touch these unless they are very loose
 compared to the adjustment screws.  And if you have to turn them clockwise,
 carefully watch where they would hit the bore to make sure they do not
 come near it!  Checking this for the adjustment screws won't hurt even
 though normally such disasters should not be possible with them.  But, it's
 always possible someone before you installed screws that were too long!
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Adjust each pair (two tops, then two sides) to peak power.
<p>
 <li>Go back and forth between the same pair to be sure that it is optimal.
 </ol>
</ul>
<p>
Touch up the mirror alignment after the bore centering.
<p>
Keep in mind that all of these adjustments interact to some extent.  So,
it's possible to be at a local maxima and lose sight of the global
optimization.  For example, changing the position of one of the bore
centering adjustments may reduce the power initially, but adjusting the
other one and realigning the mirrors may get it back and more.  These
are third order effects though, so doing the procedure above should
get you most of the may to a happy laser. :)

<li>Back to <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtoc">HeNe Laser Testing, Adjustment,
 Repair Sub-Table of Contents</A>.
<h2>Collimation of HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htrrfpc">Reasons for Poor Collimation</A></h3>

The output of most HeNe lasers is a very well collimated beam - approaching
the theoretical diffraction limited optimum possible for a given bore
diameter.  It isn't expected to look like that of a flashlight!  However, a
number of factors can affect this performance - and some are by design:
<ul>
<li>Optics in the output beam path.  This is the most obvious but often
 overlooked possibility.  Even if there are no external optical components,
 if the Output Coupler (OC) mirror of the laser is curved (concave) with no
 corresponding curve on its (non-active) outer surface, this forms a negative
 (diverging) lens.  Beam divergence in this case can be several times what
 would be expected from diffraction limited calculations based on the tube's
 bore diameter.  The raw beam is of no lower or higher quality.  However, if
 what you expected was a diffraction limited beam divergence directly from the
 tube, you're out of luck,
<p>
 For any application requiring additional optics (like a beam expander with
 spatial filter), this doesn't matter as they can easily provide the
 corrections and will be essentially the same in either case.  In fact,
 where just a wider parallel beam is desired (without a spatial filter), the
 external optics can now even be made simpler - just a single positive lens at
 the appropriate distance from the beam exit.
<p>
 To test for a diverging OC, observe your reflection from the output mirror and
 see if it is smaller than from a plane surface.  Alternatively, reflect the
 beam from a well collimated HeNe laser off of the OC to a card or screen.  If
 it spreads more quickly after reflection, your OC acting as a diverging lens.
 The outer surface will reflect weakly since it is AR coated - don't confuse
 this with the reflection from the actual OC.  If the weak reflection does not
 spread as quickly, you have a negative lens as described above.
<p>
<li>Dirty optics.  A fingerprint or coating of dirt or condensed tobacco
 smoke residue or cooking grease can result in effects similar to poor
 collimation.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrcno0">Cleaning HeNe
 Optics</A>.
<p>
<li>Problems with mirror alignment.  While this will likely result in a
 weakened and distorted beam (or no beam at all), excessive divergence might
 also be possible.  Gently pressing on the mirror mounts (or turning the
 adjustment screws a tiny amount) in any direction should result in an
 (approximately) equal reduction in output if the alignment is optimal.  It
 shouldn't result in a drastic change in beam shape.  If it does, see the
 section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="htrichl">Improving the Collimation of a HeNe Laser with a Beam
 Expander</h3>

The following applies to any laser which outputs a substantially parallel
beam but is written specifically for HeNe lasers.  Collimation of laser
diodes require a slightly different approach - see the section:
<A HREF="laserdio.htm#diobcc0">Beam Characteristics of Laser Diodes</A>.
<p>
Although the divergence of a HeNe laser is already pretty good without any
additional optics, the rather narrow beam as it exits from the tube does
result in a typical divergence between 1 to 2.5 mR (half of total angle of
beam).  1 mR is equivalent to an increase in beam diameter of 2 mm per meter.
<p>
As noted in the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt1">HeNe Laser Tubes and
Laser Heads</A>, beam divergence is inversely proportional to the beam
diameter.  Thus, it can be reduced even further by passing the beam through
beam expander consisting of a pair of positive lenses - one to focus the beam
to a point and the second to collimate the resulting diverging beam.  Though
the beam will start out wider, it will diverge at a proportionally reduced
rate.
<p>
A small telescope can be used in reverse to implement a beam expander to
collimate a laser beam and will be much easier to deal with than individual
lenses.  (This is how laser beams are bounced off the moon but the telescopes
aren't so small.)  Using a telescope is by far the easiest approach in terms
of mounting - you only need to worry about position and alignment of two
components - the laser tube and telescope.  The ratio of original to expanded
beam will be equal to the magnifying power of the telescope.  Even a cheap 6X
spotting scope will reduce divergence six-fold.
<p>
If you want to use discrete optics:
<ul>
<li>The focusing lens should have a short focal length (F1) such as a
 microscope or telescope eyepiece (e.g., F1 of 10 mm) or low power microscope
 objective (e.g., 10X).  Note: the objective lens from a dead CD player has an
 ideal focal length - about 4 mm - but is aspheric and would probably not be
 that great but give it a try!
<p>
 This will focus the laser beam to a (diffraction limited) point F1 in front
 of the lens from which it will then diverge.
<p>
<li>The collimating lens should be a large diameter medium focal length (e.g.,
 15 mm D2, 100 mm F2) lens placed F2 from the focus of the first lens.
</ul>
For optimal results, the ratio of collimating lens diameter to focal length
(D2/F2) should greater than or equal the ratio of HeNe beam diameter to
focusing lens focal length (D1/F1).  This will ensure that all the light
is captured by the collimating lens.
<p>
The beam will be wider initially but will retain its diameter over much longer
distances.  For the example, above, the exit beam diameter will be about 10 mm
resulting in nearly a 10 fold reduction in divergence.
<p>
Adjust the lens spacing to obtain best collimation.  A resulting divergence of
less than 1 mm per 10 meters or more should be possible with decent quality
lenses - not old Coke bottle bottoms or plastic eyeglasses that have been used
for skate boards. :-)
<p>
Note that some HeNe tubes have wide divergence by design using an external
negative lens glued to the OC.  For these, removing this lens with a suitable
solvent may be all that is needed to produce the divergence you want.  See the

<h2>Beam Polarization of HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htrtch">Typical Polarization Characteristics and Problems</A></h3>

Sealed HeNe tubes with internal mirrors which are linearly polarized usually
incorporate an internal Brewster plate to suppress the unwanted polarization
orientation - and these HeNe tubes are more expensive.  Where mirrors are
external, the Brewster windows on the plasma tube accomplish this function
and the output of these is always linearly polarized.
<p>
Common inexpensive internal mirror HeNe tubes produce a beam that is either
randomly polarized or slowly changing in polarization (as the tube heats) -
possibly with a combinations of polarization states present simultaneously.
Placing a polarizing filter in the beam of one of these lasers results in a
variation in brightness, usually taking place over a few seconds possibly with
sudden shifts as various modes compete for attention inside the resonator.
The presence of any of these characteristics makes such a laser unsuitable for
many experiments and applications.  These tubes are normally designated as
'random polarized' (with an 'R' somewhere in the model number) which translates
as: "The manufacturer has no idea of what the polarization characteristics will
be at any given time". :)
<p>
If the polarization were truly random, meaning all polarization states are
present simultaneously (or on a short enough time scale that it doesn't
matter), a simple polarizing filter in the beam path will produce a linearly
polarized beam at the expense of at least one half the output power (that
which is blocked because its polarization orientation is wrong and because of
losses in the filter).  However, where the polarization orientation of the
laser is slowly changing, this approach will result in unacceptable varying
output intensity from the polarizing filter.  Additional optics including
polarizing beamsplitters, mirrors, and combiners can in principle, at least,
produce a stable polarized beam but these are complex and expensive.

<h3><A NAME="htrdpo">Determining if a Laser Tube is Linearly Polarized</A></h3>

There are several ways to determine if a HeNe (or other internal mirror) laser
tube or head has random or linear polarization (all external mirror laser with
Brewster angle windows are linearly polarized):
<ul>
<li>See if there is a 'P' in the model number.  Those like Melles Griot use
 designations of 'LHR' for random polarized red HeNe tubes and 'LHP' for
 linearly polarized tubes.  Many other manufacturers do something similar.
<p>
<li>Look through each of the mirrors into the <i>unpowered</i> tube and see if
 there is an internal angled Brewster plate near one end of the tube.  A
 randomly polarized tube will have no additional optical components between
 the mirrors.  CAUTION: Disconnect power and discharge the tube capacitance
 first!
<p>
<li>Pass the beam through a polarizing filter to see if it is polarized. :)
 If it is polarized, there will be an orientation of the tube with respect to
 the filter at which virtually no light gets through (but see below).
<p>
<li>Reflect the beam off of a microscope slide or other transparent surface
 at its Brewster angle (typically around 57 degrees - see the section:
 <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioibrw">What is a Brewster Window?</A>).  If the beam
 is polarized, you should be able to rotate the tube or head orientation until
 virtually no light is reflected (but see below).
</ul>
Note: Random polarized lasers are generally not truly random but will tend to
(longitudinal) mode cycle and some modes will tend to favor a particular
polarization orientation.  This will result in the polarization changing
gradually or suddenly (especially as the tube is heating up) so at any given
time, they may emit a polarized or partially polarized beam but its
orientation will not be predictable.  Thus, to confirm that your tube is
polarized requires that the polarization remains constant - not just for an
instant (30 seconds to 1 minute should be enough time to wait to know for
sure).  If the beam is reflected off of a non-metallic reflective surface
(which acts somewhat as a polarizer), you may see a <i>large</i> variation in
brightness due to the polarization changing especially if it is a low gain or
short tube where fewer modes are active simultaneously.
<p>
Even a polarized tube may show a small amount of variability of the low
intensity beam passed by a polarizing filter or reflected from a Brewster
angle plate - this is normal and one reason why the specifications only say
500:1 or 1000:1 and not infinity:1.  The reason is that the tube's linear
polarization results from the cavity gain being maximized by the internal
Brewster plate at the polarization angle.  However, gain function with
respect to angle is not a singularity - there is still enough gain for a few
degrees on either side to maintain oscillation.  And, some samples are better
than others.

Characteristics and Problems</A>.

<h3><A NAME="htrurp">Unrandomizing the Polarization of a Randomly Polarized
 HeNe Tube</A></h3>

The best option where a polarized beam is required is to start with a HeNe
laser that produces a polarized beam!  However, for the experimenter, there
is at least one alternative - magnets to the rescue!
<p>
I have found that placing powerful magnets alongside a random polarized tube
will result in a highly linearly polarized beam.  While this may be common
knowledge at the Afternoon Teas attended by laser physicists (assuming they
drink tea), it certainly isn't something found in popular books on lasers.
<p>
A type of magnet that works quite well has a strength of several thousand
gauss.  The ones I used came from the voice coil positioner of a moderate
size hard disk drive.  They are rare earth magnets with dimensions of about
1.25" x 2.5" x .375" with the broad faces being the N and S poles.  The amount
of polarization is most pronounced by placing one of the broad faces of the
magnet against the tube near its mid-point.  Some adjustment may be needed to
optimize the effect.  I do not know how much magnetic field strength is needed
but even moving this magnet 1/4" away from the tube surface greatly reduced
the ratio of light intensity in the two orthogonal polarization axes.
<p>
CAUTION: These types of magnets are very powerful.  In addition to erasing
your credit cards and other magnetic media, they will tend to crush, smash,
or shatter anything (including flesh or your HeNe tube) between them and/or
between them and a ferrous metal.  Some portions of a HeNe tube or laser head
may contain parts made from iron or steel.  These rare earth magnets also tend
to be quite brittle.  In addition, the violent uncontrolled movement may place
you and a HV terminal in the same space at the same time as well!  Take care.
<p>
With the magnet's N or S pole placed on the side of the tube, the result was
a vertically polarized beam.  By rotating a polarizing filter in the beam
path, beam intensity could be varied from nearly totally blocked to nearly
totally transmitted and the polarization orientation followed the magnet as it
was rotated around the tube.
<p>
The control wasn't perfect - a small amount of light with a slowly varying
polarization did sneak through.  However, it was significantly less than 1
percent of total beam power for these particular tube and magnet combinations
(I have tried this with 2 different tubes with similar results).  The constant
portion of the residual beam may have just been a result of the imperfect
nature of the polarizing filter.
<p>
By using two similar magnets - one on either side of the tube with N and S
poles facing each other (mounted on an aluminum U-channel for support and so
they would not crush the tube), the variation in residual beam intensity was
virtually eliminated.  I do not know if this effect was due to the increased
magnetic field or its more homogeneous and symmetric nature.  This was also
used successfully with an enclosed HeNe laser head:

<p>
<A HREF="maghene.gif">Use of Magnets to Generate Polarized HeNe Laser Beam</A>
shows acceptable locations for one pair of magnets along side a typical 1 mW
HeNe tube.  This placement was found to be effective but possibly not totally
optimal - experimentation may be required.  Under some conditions, a single
magnet slighlty separated from the tube seemed more effective, possibly
because the field was spread over a longer stretch of bore.
<p>
As far as I could tell, with this dual magnet configuration, the output beam
characteristics were similar to those of a polarized HeNe tube.  However,
additional and/or more powerful magnets might be necessary with other tubes.
<p>
Output power did not appear to be affected significantly.  A measurement
done later on a Melles Griot 05-LHR-911 HeNe laser head showed that when
the polarization effect was most complete, the output power decreased
by about 5 percent.  A polarizing filter would nearly totally block the
beam at one orientation and have minimal effect 90 degrees away from this.
<p>
I do not know about the stability or reliability of this scheme but the only
other effects seem to be to increase the required input starting/operating
voltage and/or magnitude of the negative resistance of the tube slightly
(current dropped by about 10 percent with the magnets using an unregulated
power supply) and possibly to shift to point of maximum beam power to a higher
tube current (5 mA instead of 4 mA for one tube - but this could have just
been my imagination as well).  With that 05-LHR-911, the operating voltage
at 5 mA increased from 1,500 V to 1,550 v with one set of magnets and to
1,600 V with two sets.  And, the laser would not stay on in a stable manner
with the magnets very near the anode (cable) end of the laser head, but I
didn't think to try and adjust the current setting to see if that would
help.
<p>
As a side note, output power *increased* by about 5 percent with a magnet
some distance from the laser head, possibly due to the Zeeman splitting
suppressing IR losses, but of course there was no effect on polarization.
<p>
Where the capillary of the plasma tube is exposed as with many older lasers,
and the magnets can be placed in close proximity to the bore, their strength
can be much lower.  Some commercial lasers (like the Spectra-Physics model
132) offered a polarization option (-01) which adds an assembly consisting
of several ferrite magnets glued between steel plates that screws in place
alongside the tube with the pole pieces (the steel plates extending
beyond the magnets) above and below the tube bore.  I performed some tests
using a near-mint condition SP-132 (from around 1973) and the original
magnet option, the extinction ratio and power stability are not as good
with the magnets compared to the more common approach using a Brewster plate
or Brewster window tube though.  The Spectra-Physics specifications only
claim an extrinction ratio of about 30:1 compared to 500:1 or better for a
laser using a Brewster plate or window.  I doubt that magnets are used for
polarization in any modern HeNe lasers.
<p>
Since it is possible to control the polarization orientation with permanent
magnets, the next step would be do this with electromagnets.  This would
permit polarization to be dynamically controlled.  Adding a fixed polarizer
would provide intensity modulation without any connection to the power supply
or expensive electro-optic devices.  Hopefully, by using multiple sets of
coils distributed along the side of the HeNe tube, a lower field strength
would be adequate.  Liquid helium cooled superconducting electromagnets would
definitely add to the cost of the project. :-)  Perhaps, someday, I will try
this out.

<h4><A NAME="htrmmp">Magnets and Mode Plots</A></h4>

Several years after doing this initial experiment, I recorded the mode
behavior of a common barcode scanner HeNe tube with different magnetic
field configurations.  The laser itself is the same one used to construct
the system described in the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnsvssl">Sam's
Very Simple Stabilized HeNe Laser</A>, mainly because it already had
photodetectors mounted for the two polarization orientations.  It was
also known that the particular tube was nicely behaved with respect to
mode sweep, with no tendency to flipping.  Two sets of magnets were used.
The plots were obtained for each magnet set over about 8 minutes as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>2 to 3 minutes of initial warmup (not shown).
<p>
<li>1 minute with the magnets placed at 0 degrees (Hor-N).
 With no field present (here and at the end of the plot).  The two
 orthogonal polarizations of this well behaved tube are changing
 in the normal manner as the tube warms up with a smooth alternation
 of intensity between the P and S polarizations.
<p>
<li>1 minute with the magnets placed at 0 degrees (Hor-N).
<li>1 minute with the magnets placed at 90 degrees (Ver-N).
<li>1 minute with the magnets placed at 180 degrees (Hor-S).
<li>1 minute with the magnets placed at 270 degrees (Ver-S).
<p>
<li>1 minute with no magnetic field.
</ul>
<p>
The following two sets of magnets were used for these tests:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Three pairs of medium strength ferrite magnets positioned on each side
 of the tube resulting in a fairly uniform transverse field over about
 half the length of the tube roughly centered between the mirrors.  These
 magnets are 2" high by 5/8" wide by 1/4" thick, placed 5/8" apart
 side-by-side.  <A HREF="sp088m3.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Mode
 Behavior in a Moderate Transverse Magnetic Field</A> shows the results.
<p>
 An aluminum frame with the 3 sets of magnets was placed over the tube in
 each of the 4 possible orthogonal orientations for about 1 minute.
 The strength and configuration of these magnets results in the beam
 being somewhat polarized, but with significant double frequency ripples
 in intensity of both modes.  Surprisingly, the preferred polarization
 orientation is <i>orthogonal</i> to the orientation of the magnetic
 field!  When the magnets are rotated 90 degrees, the effects essentially
 swap polarizations.
<p>
 Note how the total power is significantly higher than with no field
 for the first two magnet orientations. There is also a the difference
 in shape of the modes depending on orientation of the magnets, ranging from
 pulse to sinewave.
<p>
 Orientations of the moderate strength magnetic field other than horizontal
 or vertical produce intermediate effects, but with low stability and even
 some flipping behavior.
<p>
<li>A single pair of very strong rare earth magnets similar to those in the
 setup described above, but somewhat longer along the direction of the tube
 (about 2-1/2 inches).  Each magnet was 1-3/8" high by 1-3/4" wide by 1/4"
 thick located toward the anode-end of the tube.
 <A HREF="sp088m4.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Mode Behavior in a
 Strong Transverse Magnetic Field</A> shows the results.
<p>
 The super strength pair of magnets was placed over the tube, again for about
 60 seconds in each orientation.  In all cases, the polarization preference
 was very strong and lined up with the magnetic field.  The suppression of
 the mode orthogonal to the direction of the magnetic field was nearly
 perfect.  But, the total output has declined for all but the second
 orientation (Ver-N) and quite dramatically for the last one (Ver-S).
 That reduction is at least 20 percent and quite obvious simply observing
 the brightness of the spot on the photodiode.
<p>
 It may be possible to find a preferred orientation of the high strength
 magnets where the total output power is maximized with good stability.
 Ver-N seemed particularly good with total power at least equal to that
 without magnets.
<p>
 A closeup of the first case is shown in
 <A HREF="sp088mc.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 Mode Behavior in a Strong
 Transverse Magnetic Field (Hor-N)</A>.
 However, note from the plot that although the S-Mode (blue) is quite close
 to 0, the P-Mode (red) and total power are rather lumpy.  Of course, this
 is probably not the ideal magnetic field configuration to force linear
 polarization being only a single pair of magnets.  And, the polarization
 ratio is probably only about 50:1, not the 500:1 or 1000:1 of a normal
 linearly polarized HeNe laser.
<p>
 Orientations of the strong magnets at other angles aligns the polarization
 with them, but, but with various amount of a reduction in total output
 power.
</ol>
<p>
<p>
The individual polarized modes and total power were captured for the plots.
The two orthogonal polarization orientations (shown in red and blue)
were detected using the waste beam and photodiodes that were already
present in this laser.  A trans-impedance op-amp buffer converted their
uA-level outputs to the +/-10 V range of the data acquisition system.
The total power (shown in dark green) used the main beam with a
photodiode and resistor load.  The scale factors of the three signals
are fairly close but not perfectly matched.  However, even accepting
errors in the scale factors, there are additional unexplained discrepancies
between the sum of the modes and total power, which should be equal.  This
is especially evident for the high strength magnets comparing the
dominant mode to total power (since there is almost no power in the
other mode).  I'm not positive of the cause but suspect some interference
effects in the detector optics for the waste beam.  While not actually
destabilizing the laser, multiple reflections could explain the variation
in mode amplitude, though why it seems worse for one of the modes is a
mystery.  But the ripple remains with the optics channel when swapping the
photodiode electrical connectors.  And, rotating the pickup assembly so
it is at a slight angle definitely makes a difference.  I have seen some
high frequency noise of the laser output power possibly due to plasma
oscillation in the tube with the high magnetic field.  This may be 
resulting in some differences in response through the electronics.  It
looks like the total power is fairly well behaved, but the waste beam
power has the irregularities.  So, perhaps the preamp needs some attention.
But I did try increasing the time constant of the op-amp buffer by a factor of
10 with no noticeable change in the response.  Hmmm.  With the magnets
centered between the mirrors, the discrepancy between total power and
the sum of the mode power was even worse.  When pushed toward the
anode-end of the tube, it seems to quiet down, though that might have
just been a coincidence.  I'm going with the optics interference explanation
for now. :)

<h3><A NAME="htrmtph">Magnet Tests with a Polarized HeNe Laser Tube</A></h3>

In an effort to determine how strong the effect of a magnetic field actually
is on the polarization, I later tried the same scheme as described above but
with a small polarized tube - the type with an internal Brewster plate.  Not
surprisingly, the effect of the Brewster plate is much more pronounced than
that of even very powerful magnets.  Here is the output power after warmup
with different magnetic fields:
<p>
<ol>
<li>No magnetic field: 0.75 mW.
<li>Strong transverse magnetic field (aligned with polarization): 0.70 mW.
<li>Strong transverse magnetic field (orthogonal to polarization): 0.50 mW.
<li>Weak magnetic field (almost any orientation): 0.80 mW.
</ol>
<p>
In all cases, the polarization was unchanged and output power was at least
as stable as without any magnetic field.  Thus, even the strong magnetic field
was insufficient to overcome the losses of the Brewster plate at the (wrong)
orthogonal polarization orientation but did reduce the gain at the (correct)
aligned polarization orientation enough to cut output power by 33%.  (For this
short tube, lasing would probably have been killed entirely if forced to have
its polarization orthogonal to the correct orientation.)  These results
are not unexpected - except perhaps for (4) - I do not know if the
increase in power was simply a result of the usual Zeeman splitting effect
suppressing the IR wavelengths or something else.  A noticeable increase in
output power due to Zeeman splitting is usually associated with long high
power HeNe tubes, not the 0.5 mW tube used for these tests.

<h2>Repairing Leaky or Broken HeNe Tubes</h2>
<h3><A NAME="htrtrr0">Gas Fill Problems with HeNe Tubes</A></h3>

HeNe tubes can fail due to slow leakage through soft (Epoxy) seals (not found
on modern tubes), or actual damage or defective manufacturing leading to a
crack or break.  Helium loss through diffusion is a special case and may be
remedied easily without major effort or investment.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr1">Rejuvenating HeNe Tubes</A>.  Other gas fill
problems will require a very non-trivial amount of work and access to
sophisticated.  Minor structural damage may be repaired but then a refill will
be needed.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtrr2">Repairing and
Refilling a HeNe Tube at Home?</A>  However, if your tube is broken in half,
you should probably just salvage the mirrors (for possible future use) and
move on to other things!
<p>
The major HeNe laser manufacturers and laser repair companies may offer
regassing services for larger more expensive HeNe tubes (high power internal
mirror tubes or those with Brewster windows designed to operate within an
external resonator).  Figure on $500 or more to regas an HeNe tube, and more
still if there is physical damage (assuming they will bother with it at all).
<p>
Whether the cost of such an operation can be justified is another matter.  For
a high quality research laser it probably makes sense as the tube alone may
cost several thousand dollars or more - if a replacement can be obtained at
all. Even a basic HeNe tube with Brewster windows may cost over $600 (being
much less common and thus much more expensive than the internal mirror
variety).  However, for small sealed internal mirror HeNe tubes, low cost
replacements are readily available at perhaps 1/10th to 1/4th the cost of a
regassing service (even cheaper if you are willing to use a surplus tube).
<p>
However, where the tube has high mileage and died from use and age, it may not
simply be a matter of regassing.  The following is from the
<A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/products/faqs.asp">Melles Griot FAQ
Page</A>:
<p>
<blockquote>
"While regassing can provide some extension of the output performance in some
 gas lasers like the CO2, argon and the higher powered side arm HeNes (which
 have external optics), it is not recommended or provided for smaller internal
 mirror coaxial tubes. Typical end-of-life failure for a HeNe tube is cathode
 sputtering. This occurs when the protective oxide layer on the cathode is
 expended through continuous bombardment by the laser discharge. There is no
 cost effective way of regenerating this layer. When the oxide layer is
 expended, the discharge itself vaporizes the "raw" aluminum and deposits this
 material, in its vapor state, on other surfaces such as the optics and the
 bore."
</blockquote>
<p>
So, while refilling may help some, the sputtered aluminum coating will remain
on critical surfaces.  A careful visual inspection of the bore and mirrors may
reveal whether a suspect tube is worth saving - a black or metallic film could
indicate that serious sputtering has taken place.  However, I've also seen
tubes where discoloration in the bore, at least, had no noticeable effect on
performance.

<h3><A NAME="htrtrr1">Rejuvenating HeNe Tubes</A></h3>

These techniques may be used on HeNe tubes that are marginal due to loss of
helium though diffusion or a slight amount of contamination from air leakage
due to age.  Where the tube lases weakly, a helium soak or reactivation of the
getter may help.  If there is no lasing at all, many other causes are
possible.
<p>
The best way to determine if loss of helium or slight contamination is your
problem is to check the spectrum of the discharge.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henvsl0">Instant Spectroscope for Viewing Lines in HeNe
Discharge</A>.
<ul>
<li>Loss of helium will show up as a significant reduction in the intensity
 of the helium lines in the spectra.  The overall color will be more orange.
<p>
<li>Contamination will show up as many additional spectral lines due to oxygen,
 nitrogen, and any number of other molecules that may have invaded your tube.
 With any significant leakage, these will quickly dominate the spectrum.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="htrtrr1a">Helium Soaking</A></h4>

Where just the helium (remember how slippery those He atoms can be!) has
leaked out, there may be an alternative to the dumpster or a major refurb.
HeNe tubes which do not lase well or at all due to loss of helium can
sometimes be rejuvenated by soaking them in helium at normal atmospheric
pressure for a few days or weeks.  You don't need a pressure chamber or any
other fancy equipment - a few helium filled party balloons and a garbage bag
will do just fine.
<p>
However, there could be other causes like misaligned mirrors or excessive
tube current (due to a defective power supply).  Check for these possibilities
first and confirm loss of helium with a spectrometer capable of actually
measuring the relative intensity of the spectral lines if possible.  From my
experience, just viewing the discharge with a diffraction grating will not
reveal a low helium condition unless it is extremely severe - as in almost
none remaining.  (I've yet to actually see this.  If anyone has a HeNe tube
with certifiably low helium, please send me mail via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.  I'd be interested in testing it.)
<p>
The point to realize is that it is the partial pressure of each gas inside and
out that matters.  Neon is a relatively large atom and does not diffuse through
the tube at any rate that matters.  However, helium is able to excape even
when the pressure difference is small.  For a typical HeNe tube at only 2 Torr
(1/380th of normal atmospheric pressure), the partial pressure of helium in
the tube is still much much greater than its partial pressure in the normal
atmosphere.  So, helium leaks out even though the total pressure outside is
several hundred times greater.  Conversely, soaking a HeNe tube in helium at
1 atmosphere will allow helium to diffuse into the tube at several hundred
times the rate at which it had been leaking out.  Thus, only a few days of
this treatment may be needed if the problem is low helium pressure.  Assuming
that the desired partial pressure of He is 2 Torr, the ratio of age:soak-time
will be about 380:1 or pretty close to 1 day of soak per year of the tube's
age.
<p>
Helium loss is most likely with soft-seal tubes - those with an Epoxy-type
adhesive holding the mirrors or Brewster windows in place.  However, it is
also possible for hard-seal tubes using frit seals or optical contacting to
lose helium though probably at a slower rate and rejuvenation will also take
proportionally more time.  Checking the intensity of the He lines with a
spectroscope is really the only way to know for sure if He loss is the problem
and to also monitor the soaking process.
<p>
Almost any sort of helium supply will work for atmospheric pressure diffusion
including welding supply grade and even the stuff sold for filling party
balloons.  (Note, however, that these sources are mostly the common isotope of
helium, He<sup>4</sup>, not the light isotope, He<sup>3</sup> which may be
what was originally in your tube - see the additional comments below.)
A party tank of helium may be as little as $15 or $20 or just buy a
few prefilled balloons and empty their contents into an air-tight plastic bag
containing the HeNe tube.  However, make sure what you are getting is really
helium and NOT hydrogen!!  In addition to the flammability issues, any
significant H<sub>2</sub> that makes its way into your HeNe tube will
make the situation worse - probably terminal.  Also note that as much as
50 percent of what is in those party tanks may actually be air, nitrogen,
and/or some other unidentified gas, so the process may take somewhat longer
(approximately by 100 divided by the percent of actual helium) though most
of these contaminants won't hurt the tube.
<p>
The required amount of effort hardly seems worthwhile for a $15 1 mW HeNe tube
but it is something to keep in mind for other more substantial and expensive
types.
<p>
Note that there are a few types of tubes that won't benefit from helium
soaking even if they have certifiably leaky seals.  Those are tubes where
the seal is between the interior and another sealed chamber as with some
older Aerotech HeNe lasers.  In these, the leaky seal is on a Brewster window
but the laser mirrors are attached with frit or Epoxy to an external sealed
chamber which is filled with air.  The only thing helium soaking will do
is slightly increase the partial pressure of He in that external chamber
which will essentially no effect on the internal gas fill.  It might
be possible to drill a hole in the metal end-plate or melt a hole in
the glass of the external chamber though, hopefully without contaminating
the Brewster window.  Or, use a diamond saw to cut one end off entirely
and install the mirror on an adjustable mount.
<p>
(From: Mark W. Lund (lundm@xray.byu.edu).)
<p>
I have rejuvenated HeNe laser tubes with low helium pressure.  Since the
partial pressure of 1 atmosphere helium is much higher than inside the tube
you don't really need to use high pressure, or even increased temperature.  I
just put them in a garbage bag and blasted some helium into it from time to
time.  The length of time necessary in my case was a few days, but depending
on the glass type, thickness, and sealing method this may vary.  It would be
good to test the power every couple of days so you don't overshoot too much.
<p>
One warning: Helium has a lower dielectric strength than air, so don't try to
operate the laser in helium as it may arc over.
<p>
(From: Philip Ciddor (pec@dap.csiro.au).)
<p>
My information is very old, but may be helpful. Early 2 mW red tubes had about
2 torr of He, so soaking in 760 torr (1 atmosphere) of He for 1 day per year
of life roughly restored the initial He pressure, since diffusion rate is
proportional to pressure difference. I have no data on the gas mix in current
green or IR tubes, but if you can find it, similar scaling may be feasible.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Gas fill probably isn't all that different for non-red HeNe tubes so the same
general recommendations should apply.  However, since their gain is lower,
nearly everything about near-IR (1,523.1 nm and 1,152.3 nm), orange (611.9 nm),
yellow (594.1 nm), and particularly green (543.5 nm) HeNe tubes is more
critical including power supply current and mirror alignment.  So, it is
important to eliminate other possible explanations for low or no output or
other problems before blaming loss of helium.
<p>
I cannot overemphasize the importance of carefully monitoring the amount of
helium that has diffused back into the HeNe tube (by removing it from the bag
of He and testing with a spectroscope periodically and for a laser beam) - once
helium pressure goes too high, the only (non-invasive) way of lowering it is to
wait a few years or decades. :-)  If power is just low and you are trying this,
put the tube in the helium soak for a couple of days and then check power
output again.  If it has increased, repeat this procedure a couple days at a
time until power levels off or starts to decrease.  If power decreases after
the first soak, helium loss isn't your problem!
<p>
If it's possible to wrap the tube such that only the seals are inside the
helium and not the electrode connections (the glass envelope shouldn't leak
at any rate that matters), monitoring of power can be done without having
to remove the tube from the helium container or whatever.
<p>
CAUTION: Apparently, most modern HeNe tubes are actually filled with the light
isotope of helium, He<sup>3</sup>, rather than He<sup>4</sup> which for all
intents and purposes, is the one found in nature (99.9998%).  He<sup>3</sup>
has a higher energy state which may be better for exciting certain
transitions.  Thus, helium soaking with common He<sup>4</sup> could result in
problems including reduced maximum power, greater frequency spread, reduced
stability, or something else.  As noted above, once the HeNe tube has been
helium soaked, the effects are irreversible without waiting many years.  The
only practical way to determine what isotope(s) of helium your tube used is
probably to ask the manufacturer - even a high resolution spectrometer won't
help if the helium has escaped.  For a common red HeNe tube, there is little
to lose by using common He<sup>4</sup> though results may not be optimal.
However, if the tube is from a specialized research laser, it would probably
be best to have a professional laser refurb company or the original
manufacturer deal with it.  You could make matters worse.
<p>
WARNING: In addition to not attempting to operate the HeNe tube itself in a
helium atmosphere due the lower breakdown voltage, there may even be problems
with He diffusing into power supply components or ballast resistors and
lingering there.  So, if possible, remove the HeNe tube from its laser
head or system enclosure for the helium soak.  Or else, wait awhile (your
guess is as good as mine) after dumping the helium before applying power.

<h4><A NAME="htrtrr1b">Reactivating the Getter</A></h4>

Where some air has entered due to age (not an actual leak, that you can forget
about unless you want to try refilling the tube at home - see below), it may
be possible to reactivate the getter and absorb/combine/react with the
unwanted molecules.  However, don't expect miracles.
<p>
Note that not all HeNe tubes have getters.  For some that do, the getter may
never have been activated in the first place (if the gas fill was already
deemed pure enough after pinch-off).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henhlt1a">Gas Fill and Getter</A> for info on the
getter in a HeNe laser tube.  And, if the getter was activated, the source of
the active material (in the getter electrode) may have been totally depleted
during manufacture so there may be no more remaining.
<p>
This only has a chance of working if the gas pressure is nearly correct - not
if it has changed by a factor of 100.  The closest example I have of the
effect of the getter on tube vacuum is for a typical TV or monitor CRT:
<p>
(From an engineer at Philips)
<p>
<blockquote>
"A regular CRT-type getter can reduce gas pressure from about 10<sup>-6</sup>
 Torr to its final value of 10<sup>-9</sup> Torr IFF the gases can be gettered
 at all.  H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>
 can be gettered. CH<sub>4</sub> (Methane) can not be gettered but by heating,
 it can fall apart into C (a solid) and H<sub>2</sub> that can be gettered. 
 Noble gases can not be gettered either, so their gas pressure will 
 determine the final gas pressure in a picture tube."
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, for a HeNe or Ar/Kr ion laser, those inert gas molecules ARE the
desired result! :)  Unfortunately, since the typical gas laser operates at a
pressure 1,000,000 times higher than a CRT (a few Torr), any effect of the
getter on detectable contamination is likely to be minimal.  How to tell?
If the color of the discharge is more towards white or pink than it should be
and there is still at least some evidence of lasing, the getter has a good
chance of returning it to normal assuming all its active material isn't
already used up.  If the color is too orange, then the helium loss may be
indicated and a helium soak may be all the tube needs. See the section:
<A HREF=laserhtr.htm#htrtrr1a">Helium Soaking</A>.
<p>
However, there is probably nothing to lose if the tube is unusable and you
won't be going the entire route of refilling it.  Heating the getter can be
achieved in a variety of ways including (depending on design and what you
have available): DC current, glow discharge, Sunlight and Fresnel lens, RF,
and induction heating, even a microwave oven.  See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#conmoh">Methods to Activate Neon Sign Electrodes and
Getters</A>.  The Solar heater approach is low tech and known to work where
there is no visible 'white cloud of death' (heating the white stuff (which is
probably unavoidable with the Sun's rays) seems to release previously trapped
stuff making the situation much worse).  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#consol">Simple Solar Heater</A>.
<p>
I've also tried using a 1 watt fiber-coupled laser diodes with a focusing lens
to heat the getter but although an incandescent spot could be seen on the
getter, there was no significant change in performance.  Perhaps I didn't
let it cook long enough.  A 10 or 20 watt diode or YAG laser might work
better. :)  But a CO2 laser will not work since 10.6 um can't get through
the glass.
<p>
The idea is to drive off some of the material remaining in the getter
electrode onto the walls of the tube.  If nothing appears or it turns milky
immediately, the getter probably isn't capable of helping much - though even
in this case, try out the tube again - it may have helped just enough.  Lack
of results could also mean that the getter electrode hasn't been made hot
enough or the material it contained had already been fully used up.
<p>
Note: If you expect to try your hand at actually refilling a leaky tube,
DON'T attempt to reactivate the getter - you may need it later!
<p>
The same approach can be used with ion laser tubes if they are made of glass
and you can locate the getter.  Those that are of all ceramic construction may
still have a getter, but it may need to be heated by a precisely controlled
current flow between the cathode end-bell and filament or something equally
obscure like that - not easily guessed!  Also, since these tubes are generally
much more expensive than HeNe tubes, it may pay to have it professionally
refurbed.
<p>
Once the tube has been revived (or perhaps even before you make the attempt),
adding an additional layer of Epoxy/TorrSeal at the tip of the exhaust tube,
mirror(s), and any other possible areas of leakage would be a good idea.  This
is particularly relevant for modern hard-seal tubes since they shouldn't
really leak at all (at least on time-scales that humans can understand).
Thus, any contamination generally means an actual defect at the frit seals or
exhaust tube (tip-off).  Soft-seal tubes leak by design :) but adding an
additional layer of sealant at the mirrors, end-caps, tip-off, and other
suspect locations can reduce this somewhat.  At least it won't hurt - unless
you accidentally glop it on the OC mirror! :(
<p>
I've successfully revived a couple of Melles Griot HeNe laser tubes which had
getter electrodes but no visible getter spots (which means the material is
transparent).  One was a hard-seal tube that must have been contaminated in
some way since after treatment, it has worked essentially unchanged for over
a year.  The other was a green HeNe laser tube that had an Epoxy seal at one
end.  However, all attempts to revive Spectra-Physics HeNe lasers have failed
miserably and generally made matters worse.  Heating the "white cloud of death"
material (including what's no doubt inside the getter ring) must release
whatever it previously trapped.

<h3><A NAME="htrtrr2">Repairing and Refilling a HeNe Tube at Home?</A></h3>

If you are really really ambitious, have lots of time on your hands, have
access to lab supplies, laser grade He:Ne gas mixture, and a high vacuum system
in good condition, you, too, can refill an HeNe tube - at least as an
experiment.  Whether it could be sealed off and then expect to have a long
life is another matter.
<p>
First, any physical damage would have to be repaired.  For example, if an
overzealous attempt at mirror alignment resulted in a mirror breaking off at
the frit seal, it would have to be reattached - in as precisely the same
position as possible using new glass frit or Epoxy (though that will leak
over time).  If someone yanked on the anode wire on a large HeNe tube broke
the metal-to-glass seal, that would have to be repaired - again with Epoxy or
by actually heating the glass to fuse it together.  However, the latter risks
shattering the entire tube if you aren't experienced in glass working.  If
you don't know where the leak is, then you need to find it first. :)
<p>
Once the HeNe tube is known to be gas-tight, the seal is cracked at the
exhaust tube, it is put on a high vacuum system to pump it down and backfilled
with pure He:Ne gas mix several times while baking out impurities.are very
finicky about gas purity.
<p>
For more information on this sort of endeavor, see the chapter:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#contoc">Amateur Laser Construction</A>, the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnchn">Home-Built Helium-Neon (HeNe) Laser</A>, and the

<h3><A NAME="htrtrr3">Regrinding or Otherwise Compensating for a Chipped
 Mirror</A></h3>

So that wonderful HeNe tube you had fallen in love with (we all have our
peculiarities!) got knocked loose from its mounting and fell face down on
the granite countertop.  Exactly what were you doing with your laser? :)
Now, there is a chip in the OC mirror which extends into the area of the
beam and the beam is but a shadow (well not quite but you get the picture!)
of its former self.  OK, it ouptus a unique pattern but not quite what you
had in mind!  (Note that for the most part, a similar accident with the HR
mirror at the other end of the tube wouldn't affect anything but its external
appearance.)  Is there any hope?
<p>
Well, assuming the chip isn't too deep, it is possible to grind it out and
then polish the resulting surface to optical quality.  To do this properly
will require a means of holding the tube just slightly off of perpendicular
(to add some wedge - see below) to a rotating platform on which various grades
of wet grinding compound can be introduced starting with something coarse like
400 grit and going up in stages to 1,200 grit or more, following by lapping
with optical rouge for the final polish.  That should get you a reasonably
decent result after considerable effort and cost.  But don't expect it to be
to 1/10th &lambda;!
<p>
One thing you won't be able to reproduce is the anti-reflective (AR) coating
present on most HeNe OCs.  (Well, not unless you have access to some vacuum
coating equipment!)  That is the reason I suggest grinding it on a slight
angle - the resulting wedge will divert the reflected beam away from the axis
of the cavity and minimize instability and interference.
<p>
I was given a cute little HeNe tube with such a chip in the OC mirror.  Now,
this certainly wasn't worth spending much of anything to repair (it was only
a .8 mW, barcode type HeNe laser after all!).  So, I decided to experiment
using the minimalist approach: emery paper.  I started with 400 grit to remove
the chip and then 1,200 grit.  I also deliberately attempted to grind the
surface parallel to the actual mirror rather than with wedge to see what would
happen.  All this just by hand so the result is also somewhat convex rather
than perfectly flat.  I need to find some rouge to attempt the final polishing
if I ever bother.
<p>
Even without fine polishing, the beam was much much cleaner than it used to be
(formerly being spread out off to one side in random directions!).  Just for
grins and giggles, I went back to 600 grit to see what effect an even more
random ground surface would have on the beam.  The interference patterns are
really quite interesting - sort of like a stellar globular cluster - so I may
just leave it the way it this way. :)
<p>
Another alternative where the area of the beam just touches the chip might be
to push the mirror mount side-ways beyond the restricted area.  With care, it
may be possible to shift it by as much as .5 mm which could be enough.
<p>
Or, use some optical cement to glue a flat piece of glass to the mirror
filling the voids.  With the proper material that closely matches the index
of refraction of the mirror glass, such an approach may result in a beam that
isn't too terrible. :)

<h3><A NAME="htrmic">Using a Microwave Oven to Evaluate and Revive HeNe Laser
 Tubes</A></h3>

WARNING: These are dangerous procedures, at least for your laser tube!  Attempt
at your own risk.  There is a good chance that the tube will be ruined totally
as a result of the glass or glass-to-metal seals cracking.  There is also a
chance that the procedures will make the situation worse or that any apparent
improvement will be temporary.
<p>
Note that using a microwave oven is safe for just checking to see if the tube
is gas-intact and has approximately the correct discharge color.  In this
case, only a second or two is needed so heating is minimal.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhtt0">How Can I Tell if My Tube is Good?</A>.
<p>
The whacko procedures below may be used to provide an idea of what is wrong
with a HeNe tube as well as to at least partially revive them in some cases.
The difference between evaluation and revival is basically in cooking time
and how many times the procedure is repeated.
<p>
Alternative sources of RF energy can be used in place of the kitchen
microwave but may not be quite as convenient or as readily available. :)
<p>
I have had some modest success in at least partially reviving some old
soft-seal HeNe laser tubes with the power output from 4 of 6 weak tubes
being improved significantly, though not to anywhere near the rated
specifications.  However, one tube was destroyed due to the glass cracking
(the first one I tried, not having a feel for the safe cook time), and on
another, the power went down slightly.  To what extent these results are due
to getter reactivation or other phenomena is not currently known.  The effects
of the microwaves (whether it be from the discharge or just due to heating)
would also appear to be useful as a diagnostic tool for evaluating HeNe tube
condition.
<p>
Since the entire tube or whatever has to be inside the oven (don't even think
about drilling holes in the side or door!), this stunt probably only applies
to smaller helium-neon laser tubes and maybe the getters in receiving tubes if
you remember what they are. :)  Here goes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A microwave oven without a turntable but with a microwave stirrer (above
 the oven cavity) is preferred simply because it is more convenient.  It is
 probably a good idea to use the turntable if that's all you have so that
 there are no hot spots.
<p>
<li>Put a cup of water (or your chicken soup) in with the tube to act as a
 load and buffer - this will limit the peak field intensity at any point in
 the tube and protect the oven should the tube be up to air (or go up to air)
 and thus reflect all the energy back to the magnetron.
<p>
<li>You will have to experiment with the location in your oven for best
 heating.  On the one I used, it seemed to be somewhat off center - this is
 dependent on the particular model.  For the advanced course, covering
 portions of the HeNe tube or using other means to concentrate the microwave
 energy where you want it may be useful.  Removing the turntable or disabling
 the stirrer and then identifying the area(s) of peak microwave intensity may
 also permit more selective treatments.  In either case, - take care you don't
 create excessive hot spots on or in the HeNe tube!
<p>
<li>Limit your treatments to 5 seconds on high (once the microwaves start -
 about 2 to 3 seconds after pressing START for the filament of the magnetron
 to heat) and then check to see how hot all parts of the tube have become.
 Let the tube cool a bit before repeating.  I was using a mid-size oven for
 my experiments - I don't know how much the strength of the microwave field
 will be affected by oven size.  It may also be possible to run the oven
 on the LOW or DEFROST setting for a minute or two which should activate the
 microwaves for a few seconds, every 15 to 30 seconds (pulse width modulation
 is how power is controlled in most microwave ovens).
<p>
<li>Watch the light show inside the HeNe tube.  If it was originally gassy
 with an incorrect discharge color, the color will probably start out the same
 way but if the procedure is working, quickly transition to the proper
 pink-ish orange color.  The nice thing about this technique (assuming you
 don't totally ruin the tube) is that you can watch the progress!  A healthy
 tube should produce a very bright pink-ish orange display (mostly orange
 with a dash of pink). :)
<p>
<li>After a couple of treatments, power up the tube in the normal way and see
 what, if any, progress (or the opposite) has been made.  Then repeat the
 procedure until there is no further improvement (or immediately if the power
 has gone down).
</ul>

However, what you may find is that the power increases immediately after
treatment but then decays back to its original value or below over the span
of a day or so, or faster if the tube is powered.  But, this may be
repeatable, so if you just need a temporary boost, go for it! :)
<p>
I would appear that the microwave treatment may do any or all of the
following:
<ul>
<li>Release trapped helium and neon from the walls of the tube.  This may be
 due strictly to the heating effects of the microwaves or the discharge
 taking place where it normally isn't located (outside the bore).
<p>
 Result: Temporary increase in output power (for a few minutes to a few
 days depending on subsequent use) - most dramatic where gas pressure was low
 originally as in a high mileage HeNe tube.
<p>
<li>Increase gas pressure in tube due to heating of tube structure.
<p>
 Result: Temporary increase in output power (for a few minutes).
<p>
<li>Activate getter due to heating of the getter electrode and/or glow
 discharge affecting material in it directly.
<p>
 Result: Removal of non-noble gas molecules, restoration of discharge color
 to normal, and permanent (as these things go) boost in power output if
 contamination wasn't too serious and there was still some active getter
 material available.  More limited or no effect if supply of active getter
 material is inadequate or already exhausted totally.
<p>
<li>Release old trapped contamination from getter spot due to microwave
 heating.
<p>
 Result: Increase in unwanted gases and reduction in output power (possibly
 to 0.0 mW) or even total inability to sustain a discharge or start at all.
 It may be possible to reverse this and at least get back to where you started
 by selectively heating just the getter (possibly by some other means).
</ul>

I expect that none of these phenomena will be result in a substantial change in
behavior for a healthy tube.  Thus, microwave (or other RF) excitation/heating
may represent a viable diagnostic tool for evaluating HeNe tube condition.

<h2>Reports from Sam's HeNe Laser Hospital</h2>

A HeNe laser might seem like a simple bit of technology, a glass bottle
with mirrors at each end filled with electric sign gases.  But that cannot
be much further from the truth.  They can suffer from all sorts of maladies
due to improper design, manufacturing, calendar age, hours of use,
abuse, and neglect.  These include (in no particular order): physical
damage, contamination and other gas problems, slight or total loss of
mirror alignment, improper coatings on the mirrors, wrong mirror curvatures,
wrong size bore, lack of wedge in the mirror substrates, failure of cathode
can pickling, bad electrical connections inside the tube, running with wrong
current or reverse polarity, and many more.  And too few of these are covered
by popular laser health insurance plans and warranties.  The warehouses
and dumpsters of laser manufacturers have been filled with all sorts of
specimens, and many eventually find their way to laser surplus outfits
and eBay! :)

The following are some of the cases I've come across over the years.

<h3><A NAME="htrsams">Sam Succeeds in Aligning a LONG HeNe Tube</A></h3>

Just to show that the alignment techniques in the sections starting with
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A> aren't some
textbook exercises dreamed up by theorists, long HeNe tubes can be aligned
from scratch using a minimalist approach.  I did it once.  (Well, actually
twice but the other tube was pretty short so it doesn't really count.)
How many data points do you need to prove something? :)

<ul>
<li><b>Patient:</b> Aerotech style 30" long HeNe laser tube.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Starts but no output beam.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Optimal current: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> Checked alignment at both ends, no change.  See
 additional comments below.
</ul>
<p>
I had a 30" HeNe tube sitting in my attic for about 2 years.  It would start
but not lase.  (To power it, I am using an SP-255 exciter set at its minimum
current of 7 mA with an 80K ballast resistance.)  The lack of lasing is
almost certainly due at least in part to mirror alignment problems.  In fact,
originally, one of the mirrors was obviously bent at a visible angle!  I had
tried to straighten them both the best I could when I acquired the tube but
was unsuccessful at that time.  I had used the basic reflection technique
for mirror alignment but wasn't able to configure the setup stably enough to
work on such a long tube.
<p>
A few days ago, I decided what the heck, no darn HeNe tube is going to get the
better of me!  First, I tried using the beam from an argon ion laser (it's blue
so would pass down the bore and hopefully could be centered).  No dice.  The
beam diverged too quickly for the long bore and it was impossible to figure out
exactly what 'centered' meant - there was no single easily identified best
position and orientation.  (I assume that when laser companies do this, they
have additional optics to produce beam of optimal size and minimal divergence
as well as a spatial filter to clean it up.  I wasn't quite willing to go to
that amount of effort!)
<p>
I then contemplated building a light bulb and telescope rig as described in
conjunction with the home-built lasers in Scientific American but concluded
that such an approach wouldn't have any chance of working with a long narrow
bore tube.  I also attempted the method whereby the reflection of the discharge
from the far mirror results in a slightly brighter spot exiting the near mirror
but not knowing how far off the mirror alignment actually was, this proved
impossible and even <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm3">Sam's Super Cheap and Dirty
Laser Power Meter</A>) with its sensitivity boosted by using a 5 uA panel
meter for the readout (about 2 uW full scale) could detect absolutely no
change when tweaking the mirrors.  Bummer. :(
<p>
So, I decided to use the "Bore Sight" method described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir3">Major Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>.
Please refer to <A HREF="bsalign.gif">Bore Site Method of Internal Mirror
Laser Tube Alignment</A> for what should be fairly self explanatory diagrams
of this technique if you don't want to read the feature length version. :)  The
Bore Sight Cards (BSCs) were screwed to the ends of my wooden "Big HeNe Tube
Cradle" (a pair of V-blocks attached to a 1x4) and their 1/16" holes carefully
lined up with the bore of the 30" Tube Under Test (TUT).  With the TUT removed,
the Alignment Laser (A-Laser, a 1.5 mW HeNe head) was placed on the platform
described in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir4">Simple Adjustable
Optics Platform</A> with its aperture about 2-1/2 feet from the nearer BSC
and aimed squarely down the center of the two bore sights.
<p>
The TUT was then placed back in the cradle in exactly the same orientation as
before, first with the OC facing the A-Laser.  A lever adjuster (read: big
flat blade WELL INSULATED screwdriver) was used to tweak the mount at the OC
end to center the doubly reflected spot precisely into the bore sight aperture.
Note: Two reflections - First from the TUT mirror and second off of the OC of
A-Laser - this actually increases the sensitivity to alignment error).  Then,
I turned the TUT end-for-end to do the same with its HR mirror.
<p>
A weak beam appeared after the first attempt!  I practically fainted. :)  Then,
I worked at boosting the power by additional mirror adjustment.
<p>
If the tube dropped on the floor or blew up, I'd be disappointed, but I
accomplished what I really believed would be impossible without a much more
sophisticated alignment technique!  This was TOO easy! :-)
<p>
OK, it isn't perfect - At first I was only getting a maximum of 3 to 4 mW from
this 30 inch tube (which should probably be producing 15 to 20 mW) and the
power is constanting changing - going as low as 1 mW over a 10 minute or so
period.  The beam is pretty clean, just weak and variable.  Even very slight
finger pressure on the mirror mounts intensity or disappear entirely.  Gentle
pressure on the center of the tube, or the tube's orientation ("This Side Up")
also affects it noticeably.  And, "walking the mirrors" by applying equal
pressure in opposite directions at both ends doesn't seem to help much if at
all and these effects are inconsistent.  In fact, at various times, the same
amount and direction of mirror mount deflection may increase or decrease the
output!  The behavior has some similarity to normal mode cycling but where a
HeNe tube is operating with insufficient gain and/or a limited number of
available longitudinal modes.  Thus, I conclude that at this point, the
alignment is close enough that any further mirror tweaking, if needed,
will be done with the tube mounted three-screw adjusters described in the
section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir2">Means of Adjusting HeNe Tube
Mirrors</A>.
<p>
I acquired this HeNe tube along with a couple of other long tubes of pretty
much unknown pedigree.  They all appear to behave in a somewhat similar manner
(but the alignment of the others was fine).  Possible causes include any or
all of the following (I welcome any additional suggestions):
<p>
<ol>
<li>Need for magnets to suppress strong IR lines as mentioned above.  Long
 HeNe tubes often need a series of magnets to reduce the gain of the very
 strong IR lines, particularly 3.391 nm, through the process of Zeeman
 splitting (see the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henmag">Magnets in High
 Power or Precision HeNe Laser Heads</A>).  However, I don't know precisely
 when a tube is long enough for this to be a problem or under what conditions
 the use of magnets can be avoided.  A shorter but otherwise similar 19",
 12.5 mW tube operates just fine without any magnets.  I also don't know how
 much of a boost magnets can provide when all is said and one (or I exhaust
 the World's supply of magnets!).
<p>
<li>Loss of helium as a result of diffusion through the glass isn't out of the
 question (though a rough check of the spectrum doesn't show anything amiss).
 Given the age of these tubes (probably pre-1990), this is a possibility but
 I kind of doubt it to be a problem since that 19", 12.5 mW tube dates from
 the same era and if anything the effects of helium diffusion should be lower
 for a longer tube (about the same surface area to volume ratio, but a lower
 seal area to volume ratio).
<p>
<li>Poor or failed design.  It's quite possible that these tubes were never
 quite right and were sitting in the back of the 'dead inventory' storeroom
 until discarded.  One was definitely much older than the others, so they all
 weren't from the same batch, but perhaps the same recipe.  The erratic
 behavior (especially) could be explained by mirrors that were too long a
 radius or flat (it isn't easy to tell for such a long tube).  Incorrect OC
 reflectivity would result in a reduced maximum output.
<p>
<li>Or, just the fact that I neglected to issue the special HeNe laser long
 tube chants and incantations (which I have unfortunately lost).  Now, this
 is something I definitely need to consider, though I don't know what options
 are still available at this point! :)
</ol>
<p>
My initial guess was that assuming this (and the other long tubes)
aren't simply defective, is that they need a wad of IR suppression magnets in
strategic locations to boost the output power and mirror micro-adjusters to
stabilize the output power.
<p>
This tube looks exactly like any normal coaxial style HeNe tube, just a bit
longer than most.  I have a dead SP-124 laser (which is of similar length
but with a side-arm tube and external mirrors) so I know what it does for
magnets (See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht4">Description of the
SP-124 Laser Head</A>) but with that design, the magnets can be placed next to
the bore.  With a coaxial tube, there is at least a 3/4" minimum separation
meaning that the magnets would have to be much more powerful to result in an
equivalent strength magnetic field inside the bore.  And as far as I know,
big cylindrical laser heads aren't any different than small cylindrical
laser heads - no magnets. But perhaps this is incorrect.  However, Melles
Griot lists several 25 to 35 mW cylindrical laser heads in their catalog that
are only 2 inches in diameter - leaving little room for powerful magnets!
<p>
I did do some experimenting a bit later and found that a pair of really
powerful rare-earth disk drive positioner magnets seemed to help a bit with
maximum power now about 7 mW, but did little to reduce the fluctuations in
power over time - up and down.  However, a series of weaker ceramic magnets
along the side of the tube didn't do anything good or bad.  I then tried a
series of 8 toroidal ceramic magnetron magnets with alternating N and S poles
sitting under the tube and this boosted maximum power to a bit over 8 mW with
just the right finger pressure on one of the mirror mounts.  I expect that
another bunch of these magnets above the tube would add another mW or so but
kind of doubt this as a cure.  I can't imagine that the laser heads these
things were designed for required a couple dozen or more super strong magnets
to function properly.  Or, maybe there are very special locations for each
magnet (part of the secret formula) allowing for fewer and/or weaker magnets
to suffice.  The use of the magnets did boost maximum power by 60 to 100
percent but getting another 200 percent boost in this manner seems unlikely!
<p>
I do believe that the addition of the three-screw mirror adjusters will be
enough to reduce the variations in power not due to mode cycling.  With the
tube in supported inside the aluminum cylinder from a dead 24" HeNe laser head
(another of those 19" tubes, but this one was up to air), power starts off
low (below 1 mW) when cold but peaks above 7 mW and remains above 6 mW without
touching anything.  Since slight finger pressure on either mirror mount will
achieve 7 to 8 mW at any time, this suggests that it is indeed a matter of the
pointing accuracy of the mirrors changing due to thermal effects.
<p>
And with respect to magnets, I've now acquired an intact laser head with
similar a Aerotech HeNe laser tube in it.  Indeed, the thing is loaded with
magnets surrounding the tube on 3 sides over most of its length.  So, it's
quite possible they are essential to achieve any sort of stability and to
reach a reasonable output power.  However, after installing this tube
in that head, the performance isn't all that much better than with my
cobbled together collection of magnets.  My conclusion now is that the
tube was built with a defective recipe or the recipe wasn't followed,
possibly with respect to bore size versus mirror curvature.  The TEM00
mode may be too large greatly increasing diffraction losses.

<h3><A NAME="htrrnlt">Repairing the Northern Lights Tube</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient:</b> Melles Griot style 14" HeNe tube named "Northern Lights"
 due to its discharge color.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Works but at reduced power (should be 5 to 6 mW).
 Discharge color strange. :)
<li><b>Vital Signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 1.2 mW
 <li>Optimal current: 8 mA
 <li>Beam quality: Good.
</ul>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b>  This tube came in with a power output of only about
 1.2 mW and the peculiar discharge characteristics described in the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrhldc">HeNe Tube Lases but Color of Discharge Changes
 Along Length of Bore</A>.  There was no visible damage.  Mirror alignment at
 both ends was adjusted which increased the power output to 2 mW, still way
 below what should be possible for a tube of this size.  The conclusion was
 that there was internal contamination due to unknown causes and getter
 (re)activation would be required.
</ul>
<p>
Thanks to my Solar powered getter heater, the power came up to 4.6 mW (from 2
mW).  I used a $1, 7" x 10" plastic Fresnel lens reading magnifier focusing
Sunlight on both the front (the actually chemical) and the back of the steel
or whatever U-channel getter loop.  After a couple of these treatments, the
discharge was almost uniform and the correct color. Only knowing that there
was a problem would anyone notice the slight change along the bore.  The power
at this point peaked at 3.25 mW.  Unfortunately, the Sun moved away from my
HeNe tube reprocessing area (i.e., back yard) so further progress had to wait
until it returned.
<p>
Knowing that this lens would be of high enough quality and of adequate size, I
built an adjustable mount for it so that the getter can be positioned reliably
at its focus.  Not that I had too many doubts - it was quite effective at
instantly vaporizing leaves and the occasional unfortunate bug. :)  See the
section: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#consol">Simple Solar Heater</A> for details.
The next day, with my fabulous contraption in-hand, I gave the tube a few more
treatments of several minutes each, focused on the inside (active area) of the
getter.  After the third or forth of these, the maximum power leveled off
at 4.6 mW which leads me to believe that the contamination has been eliminated.
The discharge color is now perfectly normal and uniform over the length of the
bore.  It turns out that the operating voltage has increased by about 100 to
200 V (estimated) between the contaminated and present state.  In addition,
the output now peaks at just about the correct 6.5 mA rather than 8 mA as it
did before.
<p>
A summary of discharge color versus power output for this tube is given below.
I assume behavior will be similar for other tubes though the power outputs
will differ in both absolute and relative terms.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Color normal throughout: 4.6 mW.
<li>Color normal at anode, barely detectably pink at cathode: 3.25 mW.
<li>Color normal at anode, noticeably blue-ish white or pink at cathode: 2 mW.
<li>Blue-ish white or pink throughout: 0 to 1 mW depending on severity
 (expected).
</ul>
<p>
Thus, even a very slight anomoly in discharge color can indicate that output
power is likely to be much less than might be possible with a little 'cleanup'.
<p>
Interestingly, there is still absolutely no evidence of a getter spot so I
assume my procedure doesn't actually result in a significant amount of
material being ejected from the getter.  Other possibilities are that the
active chemical is perfectly clear in both its original and 'used up' state
or that it is designed to be retained within the getter structure.
<p>
Some final mirror adjustments at both ends (together using the 'walking the
mirrors' technique - see the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrwalk">Walking
the Mirrors in Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A>) and the tube is now producing
a very respectable 5.25 mW.  I pronounce it cured. :)
<p>
Followup: I retested this HeNe tube after a rest of several months.  It
appears to be unchanged or perhaps even improved a bit - output quickly climbed
to 5.25 mW and was still increasing when I powered down.  So I wonder its
problems were not due to an air leak or residual air but to some sort of
internal contamination.  Another indication of this is that the discharge
color variation was opposite of what I have seen with soft-seal HeNe tubes.
It was correct at the anode but tended toward pink/blue at the cathode.
<p>
Additional followup: After more than a year, I can detect no loss in power.
Thus, an air leak is unlikely as the original cause of the malady.  I can
only conclude that it was from a manufacturing goof.

<h3><A NAME="htrwslh">Strengthening a Weak Siemens HeNe Tube</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: Siemens LGK-7639 HeNe laser head.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Works but reduced power (should be 2 to 3 mW).
 Discharge color possibly slightly pink.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.35 mW
 <li>Optimal current: 6.5 mA
 <li>Beam quality: Fair (TEM00 but slightly elliptical).
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Checked mirror alignment at cathode-end.  It was
 almost optimal, performed some slight adjustments with minimal improvement.
</ul>
<p>
Further treatment required removing this tube from its cylindrical laser head.
This wasn't that difficult as the the end-caps came off reasonably easily due
to the brittle glue and after drilling out a pair of pop-rivets.  The 12 RTV
Silicone blobs were readily accessible and succumbed to my roofing flashing
aluminum blade.  Checking the alignment at the anode-end showed that it was
also optimal in relation to the current cathode-end alignment.  I thought that
the discharge color might have been a bit on the pink side so I performed
several Solar heating treatments on the getter but with absolutely no reaction
of any kind.
<p>
I was running out of ideas.  Normally, I would not expect the alignment at
both ends to have changed but after a comment from Daniel Ames
(dlames3@msn.com) I decided to do some more fiddling with the mirrors at both
ends of the tube.  While applying pressure to the anode-end mirror mount with
a piece of wood (dry and well insulated!) I pushed on the cathode-end mirror
mount in the <i>opposite</i> direction (this retains parallelism and is
equivalent to 'walking the mirrors' for an external mirror laser).  Guess
what?  I found that there was an orientation where this would result in
significantly increased power.  So I took a chance and bent the anode-end
mirror mount by carefully calculated amount.  In other words, at random. :)
Well, actually by an amount that was approximately sufficient to result in the
<i>decrease</i> in power when pushing on the it previously.  Then, I adjusted
the cathode-end mirror mount for maximum power.
<p>
I am now getting about 1 mW (compared to .35 mW when the patient arrived)
without any of the special Siemens chants (those should help, right?).
However, I don't think mirror alignment will go much beyond the 1 mW barrier.
I suspect that the gain of the tube is still somewhat low and that the slight
misalignment at both ends resulted in a much more dramatic drop in power than
it would have when the tube was new.  I doubt that the alignment changed much
by itself (the tube was inside a sealed laser head so I know that it hadn't
been touched by anyone else).

<h3><A NAME="htrrssh">Attempting to Revive Some Soft-Seal HeNe Tubes</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: 2-1/2 dozen Spectra-Physics model 084-1 HeNe tubes.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Varied from no or low power to perfect health.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0 to 3 mW.
 <li>Optimal current: 4 to 6 mW.
 <li>Beam quality: TEM00 (if present).
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Checked all tubes for functionality and output power
 (when cold).
</ul>
<p>
I recently acquired about 2-1/2 dozen soft-seal HeNe tubes in varying stages
of decay.  Specifically, these are the <A HREF="sp084-1.gif">Spectra-Physics
Model 084-1 HeNe Laser Tube</A>, a type commonly used in early barcode
scanners.  These use soft (Epoxy) seals for the fixed (totally non-adjustable)
mirrors bonded to the tube end-plates.  Most of the glass part of the tube is
wrapped in thick aluminum foil (probably for thermal stabilization - this is
common with even newer Spectra-Physics HeNe tubes such as their models 88 and
98), has an attached 100K ohm ballast resistor stack in heat shrink tubing,
and rubber end-caps to more or less protect against shock and damage.  (More
details can be found in the section: <A NAME="henhlt6">An Older HeNe Laser
Tube</A>.)
<p>
I performed an evaluation on each one just long enough to determine
functionality and initial power output, if any.  The 30 some odd tubes came
through as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Dead (4) - Tubes don't start at all - up to air, one visibly cracked.
<p>
<li>Weak or no beam (7) - Tubes start but produce either a beam of less than
 1 mW or no beam at all.  Some had noticeably off-color discharges.  One had
 the infamous discharge that changes color along length of bore.
<p>
<li>Good (20) - Tubes appear to be perfectly normal with an output power of
 at least 1.5 mW (most were between 2 and 2.5 mW).  (I am offering these
 to good homes essentially for the cost of packing and shipping.  See the
 section: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpssams">Sam's Stuff for Sale or Trade and
 Items Wanted</A> for details.)
</ul>
<p>
These HeNe tubes have getter electrodes and associated getter spots.  All the
weak or non-lasing tubes showed noticeable deterioration of the getter spots
with varying degrees of white or brown deposits.  (In fact, 1 of the dead
tubes was missing its OC mirror totally and 2 of the others were cracked with
interiors that looked as though they had been stored in salt water or
something else that resulted in crusty deposits and actual etching of the
glass, cause unknown.)  The good tubes have a spot which has mostly the normal
metallic black appearance.
<p>
I decided to try my solar heater getter reactivator first.  This proved to
be a big mistake. :(  Since there is no way to aim the solar beam to the getter
electrode without passing through the powdery stuff, it gets heated the most
and apparently releases all the old trapped gases that it had been
accumulating over the years (probably 20 or so).  Tube #1 (below) went
from a pink discharge and no output (but probably very near threshold) to not
being able to start at all.  :(
<p>
My next thought was to get back to my getter heater project and finish the
coupling coil - but that sounded like too much work!  Perhaps, if I had been
more patient, those renegade gas molecules would have been reabsorbed but I
didn't want to wait.  So, I decided to try reactivating the getter of tube #1
by putting it in a microwave oven.  Hey, what the heck - with a half dozen
otherwise useless HeNe tubes, I could experiment! :)  Unfortunately, I tried
pressing my luck too far by leaving the tube to cook for just a bit beyond
well done - and the glass cracked (what can you do with a capillary attached
to a mirror?).  If I had gone a little easier on it, the outcome would likely
have been positive.  It took a couple of hours to build up the courage to try
the others (with shorter bake times of a few seconds and checking for hot
spots after each one).  However, the results were mixed and I'm now somewhat
confused.  The patient status list follows:

<PRE>
   Patient                 ----------- Power Output (1) -----------
    Number     Original     After Treatment    2 Days    1 Month

         7        --            1.7 mW (3)       --      1.2 mW
</PRE>

Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The power output of each tube is listed for its initial test, immediately
 following microwave treatment, and for subsequent followup tests the next
 day.  In all cases, these data are for the maximum power after a 10 to 20
 minute warmup or where its value had obviously stabilized.
<p>
<li>Patient #1 died from excess abuse in microwave before treatment protocol
 could be determined.  R.I.P. (Rest In Pieces - Organs including mirrors and
 capillary may be useful for transplants).
<p>
<li>Patient #7 was thought to be DOA since it wouldn't start.  It was put in
 the microwave oven just to confirm.  Since the light show unexpectedly looked
 fairly normal, treatment was quickly aborted.  However, as a result, no
 initial output power reading is available.  (I expect the starting problem
 was unrelated to the tube's condition.)  The decrease in power after 1 month
 may simply have been back to its pre-nuked value.
<p>
<li>Patient #3 has had additional treatments.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrssh1">Followup Experiments with a Low Power RF
 Source on Patient #3</A>.
<p>
<li>Patient #4 was retested on a return visit and found to be outputting a
 TEM10 beam.  The cause was possibly a speck of dust on the <i>inside</i> of
 the OC mirror.  Some gentle tapping has at least partially dislodged or
 moved this flake (it can still be seen and won't go any further) with a
 resulting TEM00 beam and power output increased to .7 mW.  The of the still
 low power (for a good SP084-1, it should be at least 1.5 mW) may still be due
 to this cranky bit of dust as it can still be seen in the internal beam.
<p>
 While patient #4 was on the treatment table, the RF exciter was turned on
 with absolutely no effect.  Since there is no evidence of gas contamination,
 this isn't surprising.
</ol>
<p>
As noted, rated power of these tubes is probably about 2 to 3 mW.  From this
data, it would appear that the tubes in the worst shape are likely to benefit
the most.
<p>
Something that can be seen from the data and appears somewhat peculiar is that
cooking certain tubes just long enough so that the microwave induced discharge
glow reaches full brightness resulted in a substantial increase in output
(when powered in the normal manner).  However, after a few minutes (or maybe
a day or so), the output power would decay back to its original value (or
below as with tubes #5 and 6 - though the original values may be suspect and
the decay may have happened regardless of whether the microwave treatment was
attempted).  Tube #3 peaked at about double its final value but still retained
a 3-fold improvement compared to its condition upon arrival.  In any case, I
now believe that whatever is going on isn't strictly related to the getter -
maybe also a combination of the heat resulting from the microwave treatment
releasing trapped helium and/or neon from the walls of the tube (low gas
pressure originally), helium deficiency due to diffusion through the tube
walls/seals, or a phenomenon that is totally independent (more discussion
below).  Since this behavior can be repeated at will for those tubes that
exhibit it - a quick shot in the microwave and you get a nice, but temporary
boost in power output, which may have it uses. :)  (Patient #3 has agreed to
some additional experiments to determine if extended operation or other
more advanced treatments can actually clean up contamination.)
<p>
The result with tube #2 was impressive (in a relative sort of way, and more so
since it appeared to improve further with a day's rest) but I have no idea
why.  I imagine that at least with respect to the getter, some of these tubes
probably had no available un-activated getter material remaining in the getter
electrode, nothing to activate.  Tube #2 must have had a wad of the stuff
hiding somewhere. :)
<p>
(From: Consulting Laser Physician Daniel Ames (dlames3@msn.com).)
<p>
About Sam's microwave HeNe/getter soup recipe:
<p>
From what you have described above with the 6 patients (data for patient #7
wasn't available at the time of the consultation. --- Sam), I can only surmise
about the results showing power peaking and decaying.  If the tube was tested
within only a few minutes after being removed from the microwave oven, then I
would suspect one or more of the following to have ocurred:
<p>
<ol>
<li>He and Ne were released from the aluminum cathode and some from the anode
 metal, plus maybe some from the inner glass walls.
<p>
<li>O2 and other impurity gases were absorbed by the getter.
<p>
<li>Output power could start out higher than before the getter baking 
 treatment, but here is what I suspect might have caused the output power
 to decrease after a few minutes: The aluminum cathode most likely absorbed
 more of the microwave energy than any other part of the tube and therefore
 it also became the hottest.  As it began to heat up, it released some He
 and Ne but the treatment only lasted for what - 2 seconds approximately?
 Successful outgassing of metals in a vacuum even as high as 2 to 4 Torr 
 requires more than just 2 seconds. I suspect that one of two things caused 
 the power drop off:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The cathode remained hot enough for a few minutes and continue outgassing 
  He and or Ne and possibly raised the tube's He. and/or Ne partial pressures
  to (above) the desired pressures and caused a power drop off.... Maybe....
  Before and after discharge voltage and current tests should confirm this,
  either way, see below. Or:
<p>
 <li>The tube's gas temperature was elevated by the microwave energy which
  caused the He and Ne partial pressures to elevate too. If the tube
  originally (before treatment) was He deficient, than the elevated He pressure
  could actually cause the output power to temporarily increase until the tube 
  cools back down to a normal operating temperature and the partial pressures
  of both the He & Ne have decreased again. One way to test this could be to
  wrap the tube with a thermal insulating material (e.g., Fiberglas) to trap
  the heat generated by normal use in order to raise the gas pressures, then
  monitor the output power.
<p>
 <li>The Weird Science Theory: If the tube was immediately powered up with its
  normal power supply after being removed from the microwave oven, could it be
  possible that the He and Ne gases are behaving in a similar fashion to food
  when it is cooked in the microwave oven - I.e., the gas molecules are caused
  by the microwave energy to vibrate and possibly just like nuked food, its
  molecules are still vibrating for a few minutes after the tube is removed
  from the M/W energy and immediately powered up by its normal power supply
  and behaving differently until they stop vibrating???????
 </ul>
</ol>
<p>
What about measuring and comparing the operating voltage and current on tubes 
#5 & 6 above with the reading from tube #2, since #5 & 6 actually dropped in 
output power below that of their respective (originally) observed power.
This could give us a clue as to whether tubes #5 & 6 are actually higher in 
pressure or lower than tube #2.
<p>
It would probably be easier on the glass tube and it's geometry if it was 
powered up and thus heated up to normal operating temps (just) before 
subjecting it to the intense heating of the metal parts of the tube by he 
microwave. The aluminum cathode will expand in diameter in the microwave, the 
metal anode too, so by allowing the normal power supply to heat up the glass
and metal parts first at a normal rate of expansion, then it should have a
better chance of survival in the microwave.
<p>
HeHeHe..... and I thought this would be a 1 paragraph reply..... hehe :)
I'll submit my usual bill for services. :)
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I could believe partial pressures increasing or He being released (I've been
more convinced that He depletion may play a part though it isn't obvious from
the discharge color).  However, the metal parts of the HeNe tube actually
remain quite cool.  This could mean that any effect on the getter may actually
due to the glow discharge and not the actual microwave heating though on tube
#1, the getter glowed orange hot after a couple seconds once the tube had
cracked - I suspect it doesn't get heated nearly as well with the surrounding
gas competing for microwave attention.  The glass between the cathode and
anode of the tube gets hottest (which is what cracked with patient #1) but
the cathode itself doesn't appear to get very warm at all.
<p>
I really doubt any molecular vibration effects apply here - those sorts of
phenomena have time constants measured in small fractions of a second.  The
behavior seen with patient #3 was on the order of 20 minutes.
<p>
My current feeling is that the odd behavior is due to a combination of heating
and release of gases from the tube walls and that the fundamental problem is
one of low gas pressure but not a particular lack of He or Ne.  I do expect to
measure tube operating voltage and current producing maximum output (what of
it there is).  I may also attempt a helium soak starting with the tubes having
the lowest output power (though none of the tube's spectra appeared to be
obviously abnormal).

<h4><A NAME="htrrssh1">Followup Experiments with a Low Power RF Source
 on Patient #3</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: Weak and Variable Spectra-Physics model 084-1 HeNe tube
 designated patient #3.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: This is a followup after initial microwave treatment.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: Varies between 0.1 to 0.3 mW over the course of a few
  minutes.
 <li>Optimal current: 5 mW.
 <li>Beam quality: TEM00.
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrssh">Attempting to Revive Some Soft-Seal HeNe
 Tubes</A>.
</ul>
<p>
A few weeks after the original microwave revival experiments, patient #3
returned for some more extensive tests.
<p>
Operating a HeNe tube is supposed to result in the scavenging of residual
gas molecules due to the cathode acting as a sort of getter.  So, I decided
to perform a very scientific experiment on the most bedraggled of my
assortment of Spectra-Physics 084-1 HeNe tubes - the one with the lowest
output power and most off-color discharge - patient #3.
<p>
I started by operating patient #3 for hours on end at 5 mA.  Early in
these tests, the output power would fluctuate quite substantially - dipping
to as low as 0.1 mW at times.  After perhaps a total of 24 hours of actual
running time over the course of several days, the power has tended to
stabilize somewhat, remaining over 0.25 mW at all times and peaking at 0.4 mW
with an average of about 0.35 mW.
<p>
However, additional operation hasn't resulted in any substantial improvement
beyond this point.  A few of observations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The initial output beam power when running from a cold start was typically
 25 percent higher than the 0.35 mW average but would decay over the course of
 a few minutes to the average or below.
<p>
<li>The initial discharge color was nearly normal.  But, along with the drop
 in power was a successively more off-color discharge.  Eventually, while the
 overall bore color was only slightly pink and perhaps a bit more toward the
 blue approaching the anode, the color of the fuzzy discharge in the
 funnel at the anode-end of the tube was nearly neutral white with little
 orange or pink.  Therefore, it would appear that the funnel contains high
 concentration of the 'bad' gas at this point.
</ul>
<p>
Thus, I concluded that since gas-metal reactions at the anode electrode are
minimal, further improvement wouldn't be likely in any case since none of the
rogue gas molecules were bumping around at the cathode where they might be
taken out of circulation.  Reversing polarity would sweep them to the other
end of the tube but (1) running a HeNe tube with reverse polarity will
quickly damage the anode mirror from sputtering and (2) the molecules will
again congregate at the wrong end of the tube and stay there!
<p>
Based on these observations, some other treatment would be required -
something that would facilitate reactions at the getter and/or cathode but
which wouldn't damage the mirrors.
<p>
Using the microwave oven approach, that tube could be temporarily boosted
to 6 times its original output power with it remaining more or less at a 3X
improvement.  So, I decided to do some additional experiments similar
to these but under more controlled conditions.
<p>
I repeated the glow discharge treatments on patient #3 but using a flyback
based high frequency RF exciter instead of the microwave oven.  With this
approach, both the location of the discharge and the power level could be
selected at will.  In particular, the power could be set low enough that the
discharge could be maintained indefinitely without fear of physical damage to
the tube due to overheating.
<p>
For the RF exciter, I adapted the circuit described in the document:

<p>
With no high voltage rectifier, the output is radio frequency AC at between
10 and 20 kHz.  This was applied between the cathode mirror mount and a 2"
strip of aluminum foil wrapped around the tube to provide capacitive coupling
for the return path without involving the anode-end mirror mounts (and thus
avoiding the possibility of sputtering). There is absolutely no glow inside
any part of the bore or near either mirror mount.  In addition to allowing
capacitive coupling through the glass of the tube, the AC would also assure
that the gas molecules wouldn't get stuck in one spot.  This circuit produces
a nice glow when powered from only about 5 VDC at 1 A or so it runs cool.
The visual effect is similar to that of a plasma globe operated at low
pressure and as with those gadgets, the glow could be influenced by touching
the glass of the tube.
<p>
The physical connections to one of our patients is shown in
<A HREF="sp084rf1.gif">RF Treatment of SP084-1 HeNe Laser Tube</A>.  Note that
this way of exciting the gas in the HeNe tube will <b>not</b> cause the tube
to lase as there is no high intensity discharge in the bore.
<p>
CAUTION: If you try this, take care not to use too much voltage or the glass
may be punctured!  Spectra-Physics HeNe tubes have nice thick glass walls so
the risk is quite low but don't press your luck - it isn't voltage but power
transferred to the plasma that should matter so really high voltage isn't
required.  In fact, I'll be trying a coupling coil instead of capacitance
through the glass next.
<p>
The most effective position for the aluminum foil wrap to have any effect on
tube performance was about midway between the end of the cathode-can and the
anode mirror mount.  This resulted in the glow discharge bathing the getter
and end of the cathode.  A test with the foil wrapped around the cathode
area of the tube resulted in minimal effect despite the close coupling and
nice glow.
<p>
As with the microwave oven treatment, the RF also resulted in a dramatic
increase in output power for patient #3.  In fact, although my records are
non-existent, I believe that this resulted in even more of a boost to over
0.8 mW.  Of course, I could run the RF discharge for a long time (several
minutes in this case so far) compared to a few seconds for the microwave
treatment (before there was risk of overheating and killing the tube).
But, as before, the output power still decayed back to its original value
over the course of a half hour or so.
<p>
Accompanying the power increase was a distinct improvement in discharge color.
Recall that originally, the discharge was somewhat pink and charged to a
somewhat blue color at the anode with almost a neutral white in the funnel
next to the anode.  The new color was much more normal though possibly a
bit on the orange side indicating an excess of neon or lack of helium (as
before with the microwave oven treatment).  In fact, the funnel discharge
color was distinctly orange - more so than is typical of healthy HeNe tubes.
Another change was that the tube's operating voltage <i>declined</i> by up to
about 100 V when compared to its value with the off-color discharge.  (This
is the opposite effect observed with the "Northern Lights" tube - see the
section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrnlt">Repairing the Northern Lights
Tube</A>.  One thing that has been confirmed is that heating plays little or
no role in the power boost - the RF approach results in very little heating
of any part of the tube.
<p>
Next, I set up the RF exciter to run at the same time as the normal HeNe
power supply so I could monitor the beam power while tickling the gas outside
the bore.  With this configuration, output power could be maintained at a much
higher level, though not at the absolute maximum that could be achieved by
'off-line' RF treatments.
<p>
<ul>
<li>By shutting down the HeNe laser power supply for a minute or so for every 5
 minutes or so of operating time while allowing the RF exciter to continue to
 run, power could be consistently peaked at about 1 mW (!!).  Of course, when
 powering up, there would be a minute or two delay before this output was again
 reached.  My assumption is that by allowing the tube to 'rest', the residual
 gas molecules that had collected in the bore and near the anode would
 redistribute themselves so they could be scavenged by the RF glow discharge.
<p>
<li>The combination of the HeNe laser power supply and RF exciter could not
 maintain maximum output power together.  I suppose that while much of the gas
 in the outer reservoir could be cleaned up by the RF, when any of the
 contaminant molecules happened to wonder near the end of the bore, they would
 be sucked in by the stronger DC field gradient.  So, the net effect is still
 a small flow of these molecules toward the anode where they aren't wanted.
<p>
<li>The equilibrium power output with both the HeNe laser power supply and RF
 exciter running with minimal input (about 3 VDC resulting in perhaps 1 W
 of RF power) is around .7 to .8 mW.   This was confirmed both by starting
 at a high output power level after an extended RF treatment (about 1.05 mW -
 the maximum I have seen so far on patient #3) and letting it decay, as well
 as running it on the normal power supply without RF until the output power
 had dropped to aroudn .3 mW, turning on the RF, and watching the output
 power climb back up.  The actual amplitude of the RF doesn't seem to affect
 the equilibrium output power very much.  However, some of the RF must couple
 to the HeNe tube bore because turning the RF up causes the normal discharge
 to become unstable resulting in a flashing HeNe tube unless the HeNe laser
 power supply voltage is also increased (resulting in a higher current as
 well).  The sensitivity to this effect depends to some extent on the location
 of the coupling foil - nearer the anode reduces the amount of RF that can be
 tolerated while maintaining stability.  This would make sense of sorts since
 more of the bore is between the RF source and the grounded cathode.
<p>
<li>Performing the same experiment on another SP084-1 that exhibited low power
 (patient #4) but no evidence of gas contamination (the color of the discharge
 was normal), resulted in no significant change in output power one way or the
 other.  (The cause of this tube's problem may be dust on the inside of the
 OC mirror).
</ul>
<p>
So, it appears as though maintaining a modest glow discharge outside of the
bore can be used as a means of life support for these marginal soft-seal HeNe
tubes.  Too bad about the additional high voltage (the foil) that needs to be
well insulated. :)  If only HeNe tubes had gas return channels from the anode
to the gas reservoir!  (A helical capillary longer and narrower than the bore
would prevent the normal discharge from taking that shortcut.)  Then, there
would be a steady flow of gas and even without the RF, there would be no
concentration of contaminants in the bore or near the anode.  With the RF
active, there would be continuous cleaning and instant purifying action!
<p>
More to follow. :)

<h3><A NAME="htryhlt">Treatement for the Yellow HeNe Laser Tube with a Warped
 Bore</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: Hughes style (manufacturer unknown) yellow (594.1 nm)
 HeNe laser tube about 14 inches long.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Starts fine, no output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Optimal current: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Checked for output by gently rocking mirror mounts.
 Results inconclusive.  There was some indication of flashes but they were not
 consistent.  However, gentle tapping on the tube (not the mirror mounts)
 would result in flashes.
</ul>
<p>
This is the upper tube in <A HREF="ochnt-1.jpg">Three HeNe Tubes of
a Different Color Side-by-Side</A>.  The OC (and anode connection) is at the
left with the cathode terminal and getter visible below it.  No attachment is
made to the OC mirror mount on the right.  This may be made by PMS/REO based
on its style though I don't know for sure.
<p>
The fact that gentle tapping affected the behavior suggested that something
was loose inside.  And, even pointing the tube up in the air at various angles
would occasionally result in at least a weak output beam - perhaps the tube
would be useful as an inclinometer. :)
<p>
At first, there was no visible indication of loose parts - its general
condition is quite good.  However, upon close examination, the bore is
supported at the OC-end of the tube by a cup affair which had a set of fingers
that look sort of like the pedals of a tulip and these were actually loose
around the bore.  Either the tube had been used to hammer nails, or the mirror
mount next to the cathode can had been accidentally used as the cathode
connection causing local heating.  Since most modern HeNe tubes use the
mirror mounts for both power supply connections, a natural mistake is to
attach the negative of the power supply to the cathode-end mirror mount.
While this would result in the tube appearing to operate normally, there
will be serious overheating of the mount and possible sputtering of the
OC mirror.  The overheating could cause the petals to relax and loose
their grip but any sputtering overcoat on a low gain yellow OC mirror
would almost certainly result in *no* output.  Since there are signs of
life, this scenario is therefore unlikely.
<p>
In fact, pressing laterally on the HR-end mirror mount - not to deflect the
mirror but to actually move the entire bore slightly by flexing the glass of
the tube - would result in a strong good quality beam.  Interestingly, even
careful adjustment of the mirror alignment at both ends - but without this
external force - would only produce a weak beam with much less power than
possible with the added deflection.  The OC mirror mount could be easily
rocked without affecting anything else.  However, for the HR mirror mount,
I had to construct a Melles Griot style three-screw locking collar for this
test to be able to make slight adjustments in the alignment without
permanently bending the mount.  Otherwise, any effect would be a
combination of the bore being moved and the mirror alignment with
respect to the bore changing.
<p>
It appears as though the HR mirror was correctly aligned as just changing this
relationship would only result in lower maximum output though it was possible
to reach a compromise where the tube produced a steady beam by also tweaking
the OC mirror alignment.  However, this was less than 1/2 the possible power
available by just the bore movement technique.
<p>
My theory is that the bore is actually slightly warped - though I can't tell
by looking at it.  If it were just improperly positioned, realignment of both
mirrors should have resulted in a strong beam equal or nearly equal to its
original performance.  Given that this didn't happen, I am forced to the
conclusion that the lateral deflection not only moves the bore but also
unwarps it to some extent.  Another indication of a bore problem is that just
adjusting the mirrors tends to result in a TEM10 rather than the expected
TEM00 beam.  However, as the lateral force is applied, the beam starts out
TEM10 and then the two sub-beams merge to form what looks like a TEM00 beam
though I haven't confirmed that this is actually so.  With the cathode can
obscuring most of the interior, it is impossible to see if there are other
internal problems.  It needs to have an X-ray or CT scan.  Is there medical
insurance for sick lasers? :)
<p>
To deal with the chronic condition - there is after all no practical way to
actually go in there and really fix the problem - I intend to construct a
mount for the tube that will also have a lateral force adjustment.  Some
experimentation (actually quite a bit of it) has revealed that the optimal
force seems to be low enough that there is minimal risk of breaking the tube,
though I'd be happier with some other solution.
<p>
So, I mounted the tube in the head cylinder from a Melles Griot 05-LHR-151.
The HR mirror mount was covered with a rubber boot, around which I placed
a plastic ring with a 4-40 tapped hole on one side.  A strategically placed
hole through the head cylinder allows a screw to thread into the ring and by
very careful adjustment, pull the HR mirror mount to one side ever so slightly.
With a bit of experimentation, the optimal orientation was determined and
marked.  After a slight detour where the HV arced to my adjustment screw,
it is now stable after warmup at about 1.4 mW at 594.1 nm, which isn't bad for
a tube of this size.  I will have to add a prominent CAUTION sticker to
alert anyone that they should not attempt to tighten that magic screw as bad
things might happen.
<p>
Did I mention that the yellow 594.1 nm wavelength is my favorite. :)
<p>
Awhile later, a complete yellow PMS LHYP-0021 (yellow 594.1 nm, 0.2 mW spec)
laser head came in with a similar condition - it would only lase
at a particular orientation, but at least this was reliable and the output
power is decent (0.5 mW) considering its ratings.  However, being a
polarized laser, it would be desirable to be able to set it up without
regard to such quirks!  I don't think the bore was actually warped for
this laser, but rather that it had been whacked in shipping and that
petal assembly had been bent so that it wasn't clamping the bore firmly
in the correct position.

<h3><A NAME="htrr130a">Reviving a Spectra-Physics Model 130B Antique
 Laser</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: My third Spectra-Physics 130B HeNe laser.

<ul>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>
The SP-130 may have been the most solidly constructed of any small gas laser in
history!  See: <A HREF="sp130-3.jpg">A
Typical SP-130</A> (Note original manual).  The case, which is also the support
chassis for the tube, external mirror mounts, and power supply is built
of precisely milled aluminum panels. Everything fits together like a fine
watch (if you remember those!).  Versions of this laser were produced as early
as 1965 (that is the date on one of the diagrams in my original
"Spectra-Physics Model 130 Gas Laser Operation and Maintenance Manual",
the one in the photo, above.)  More information can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht6">Description of the SP-130 Laser</A>.
<p>
This is the third sample of the Spectra-Physics 130B laser that I have
acquired.  I don't know if there ever was an SP-130A but the SP-130 may
have been an earlier version using a tube with a heated filament instead
of the more modern cold cathode design.
<p>
SP-130B #1 initially started and had a discharge that was weak though
approximately the correct color, but died on the operating table - cause
unknown.  The discharge winked out, never to return.  All indications are
that the tube is up to air except that the getter hasn't changed to the
"white cloud of death" appearance.
<p>
Apparently, it didn't really die but would not stay lit and was so hard
to start that it I never succeeded in restarting it again.  Even testing
with an Oudin coil appeared to confirm it was up to air, but there was
probably a very faint glow, not visible under normal room lights.
I gave this laser to a friend of mine who thought he could talk a
friend of his into regasing the tube.  He managed to get it started
exactly once, like me.  More on this in the next section.
<p>
SP-130B #2 (the actual laser in the photo, above) was DOA with an up-to-air
tube and some prior dissection attempts including cut wires.  The mirrors were
also totally ruined, possibly from poor storage conditions or careless
handling or both.
<p>
Which brings us to SP-130B #3.  This one started and ran fine but the
discharge color was initially red/blue, along the lines of the example
labeled "Moderate - no output" in <A HREF="henedcol.gif">Color of
HeNe Laser Tube Discharge and Gas Fill</A>.  These are normally hopeless and
terminal but I figured it wouldn't hurt to run the laser for awhile just in
case a miracle occurred.  In fact, over a period of several hours, the color
did gradually change eventually approaching something reasonable, at least in
the bore.  (Normal is defined as "salmon" or white-ish red-orange and more of
an orange color in the expanded areas.)  The color in the expanded areas
was not as orange as would be normal but was fairly close.  But there was
still no output.
<p>
Next step: Check mirror alignment and clean optics.  First, I removed the HR
mirror and used a working HeNe laser on an adjustable platform to check OC
alignment by passing its beam down the bore and looking at the reflection
back to its output aperture.  This appeared to be slightly off center, so
a bit of tweaking was in order.  Then, I replaced the HR and adjusted it
to also place the reflection squarely back into the alignment laser's output
aperture.  Still no output.
<p>
During this time, I also attempted to clean the optics as best I could knowing
that the mirrors might be soft-coated and in that case can't be cleaned with
anything stronger than breath-fog. :)  The mirrors and Brewster windows were
cleaned without incident but the Anti-Reflection (AR) coating on the OC mirror
didn't survive so there would be slight ghost beams if the laser was to work
at all.  The sticky tape method of mirror glass retrieval recommended in the
SP-130B manual also removed the coating. :(
<p>
Next, I decided to actually consult the manual with respect to alignment -
what a concept! :)  Their procedure is even simpler than mine: Using the
curved mirror set, just tighten both mirror mounts down so they are flush with
the case.  The machining is precise enough that this should produce a beam.
I only have a curved OC, the HR is planar.  So, I tightened down the OC
mirror mount and checked it with my HeNe alignment laser - at least as good
as doing it my other way.
<p>
Doing the same with the HR mirror mount didn't produce a beam, but when I
loosened it slightly, I could jiggle the mirror just enough...  And, for the
first time in perhaps 20 years, I detected a few coherent photons in a flash
from the OC.  After somewhat more tinkering and letting the system bake,
it was doing between 10 and 40 microwatts depending on the setting of the
current adjust pot.  Maximum output is at the full clockwise position which
suggests that there is still gas contamination or possibly just low helium -
it doesn't peak as expected at some intermediate value.  After cleaning the
Brewster windows (at least <i>they</i> probably won't disintegrate like
the AR coating if looked at the wrong way!), output power has exceeded 0.25
mW, not up to spec (0.75 mW) but still a lot better than 0.0 mW and a bit
amazing considering the age of this laser.
<p>
So, this patient will be held in intensive care for some time to determine
if any more cleanup takes place.  I also suspect that a shot of helium would
be beneficial.  Given that air (probably) has leaked in, helium has likely
leaked out.  Also, the blue-green portion of the spectra of the discharge
appears a bit weak - that is mainly from the helium.  What I don't know is
the age of the tube (it was probably a replacement) but it is probably at
least 10, possibly 20 years old.  When I do get around to a helium soak,
I'll probably start with 10 days (1 day/year of life) to be on the safe side
and see if that helps.  It's bad form to overdo it by much - you can't reverse
the process except by waiting 1 year for each day of extra helium!
<p>
However, it's been over 6 years now and there has been <i>no</i> noticeable
change in performance.  The laser was obtained in November 2000
and it is now January 2007.  I run it for a few seconds almost daily and that
seems to be enough.  If not powered for a of couple days, there will be no
output initially, but it will come back in less than a minute.  So, I
rather doubt the tube is leaking in significantly but simply has some internal
contamination.  There could be some helium diffusion through the glass.
I haven't even cleaned the Brewster windows in several years.

<h3><A NAME="htrr130b">Restoration of a Spectra-Physics Model 130B Antique
 Laser</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: My first Spectra-Physics 130B HeNe laser with a regased
 plasma tube.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: No lasing
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: NA.
 <li>Optimal current: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> The laser was powered up to check discharge
 appearance.  It was a very bright orange, similar to what I've seen with
 IR (1,523 nm) HeNe lasers where the pressure is higher than would be normal
 for red (632.8 nm) lasers.  This increases the gain for the IR line but
 the gain for the red line will be less than optimal.  However, since
 pressure decreases with use, the result should be that the power (if any)
 will improve over time until it starts declining.
</ul>
<p>
A friend of mine, Phil, managed to sweet-talk a major
laser service company to regas the almost impossible-to-start plasma tube
in this laser.  OK, he actually bribed them with a dead but intact
large frame argon ion laser and some other goodies.  I never expected them
to come through, but they did - after 6 months or so.  It wasn't a full
refurb but just a "chop and fill" and the expected life may be rather
short - perhaps 100 hours.  But that's plenty given the only use is likely
to be for Phil to turn it on to show people that a (second) working SP-130B
really exists!
<p>
They actually sent me two lasers - the regased SP-130B and an SP-130
"parts" unit with an up-to-air tube that had been cluttering their back room.
The latter is actually in rather good condition other than the tube and
missing trim strips.  In particular, the mirrors were good, which came in
handy.
<p>
The laser service company was unable to get a beam after installing the
regased tube.  This wasn't entirely surprising as I knew the OC mirror
had been damaged when I removed the plasma tube to inspect it and dinged
the mirror surface with the Brewster tip.  I thought the central portion of
the mirror was in good condition, but perhaps not enough of it.
However, I doubt they tried too hard in any case.  Even a chop and
fill operation entails a fair amount of work.  So, by the time they
installed the tube, there was probably little enthusiasm for a complete
alignment.
<p>
My initial attempts to get this patient to lase were also unsuccessful.
I did install the OC mirror from the "parts" SP-130, which after cleaning,
appeared pristine.  Alcohol had no effect on the surface finish so I assume it
to be hard-coated.  I also checked the Radius of Curvature (RoC) of both HRs
and OCs to confirm they agreed with the SP specs (planar and 30 cm,
respectively).
<p>
So, having failed to detect a single coherent red photon,
I decided to order up a single pass gain test to confirm that the gas-fill
was done properly.  No sense wasting a lot of time trying to obtain lasing
if the gain is too small!
<p>
For this, I used an SP-117C stabilized HeNe laser since
its output power would be quite constant after it had warmed up and locked.
The SP-117C was placed on an adjustable platform and aimed down the bore of
the SP-130B with both mirrors removed.  By turning the SP-130B discharge on
and off, the change in transmitted power could be measured easily.  The
contribution from the discharge light was also checked with the SP-117C
beam blocked.  The result was about 1 percent - certainly enough
to lase with the normal OC mirror with a reflection coefficient of around 99
percent, since the round trip or two pass gain would be 2 percent.  (This
doesn't account for losses from the Brewster windows, but if reasonably
clean, this should be well under 0.5 percent total.)
<p>
Without the front mirror in place, the condition of each of the Brewster
windows was also checked for scatter inside and out using the alignment beam.
They were cleaned to minimize scatter from the outer surface.  There appeared
to some excessive scatter from the *inside* of the rear (HR-end) Brewster
window, but probably not enough to prevent lasing.
<p>
Next, the HR mirror was replaced and aligned to direct the reflection
of the SP-117C beam directly back to its output aperture.  (This
retroreflected beam might destabilize the SP-117C and cause it to
lose lock, but would not really matter since it was only being
used for alignment at this point.)
<p>
And then, the OC mirror was installed and aligned so the reflection from
its surface also went directly back to the SP-117C output aperture.  Still
no lasing even after loosening the locking screws of the mirror mounts, first
at one end and then the other, and jiggling. :)
<p>
The OC (front) mirror is curved - 30 cm RoC - and alignment should be less
critical than the planar HR (rear) mirror.  So, it was fine tuned and then
the locking collar on the real mirror tube (not the mount, but the slide).
In addition to allowing the mirror distance to be changed, there is some
unavoidable "slop" in the alignment.  Finally, a flash!  I had been close
to giving up suspecting that Brewster scatter was too much, but once the
flash was detected, it was quite easy to fine
tune the rear mirror to get a sustained beam, then dust off the Brewsters
windows to increase the power, and walk both mirrors to peak it.  At least
as an initial attempt.
<p>
As noted, the discharge color was more orange than normal and very bright.
It occured to me that perhaps the "very bright" part was not only a result of
overfill, but also excessive current due to a lower operating voltage than
is present at the design pressure.  Sure enough, running on a Variac, the
peal output power occured around 90 VAC instead of 115 VAC.  The knob on
the front of the SP-130B was always set at the minimum current.  Aside from
eliminating an odor of overheated electronics, running at the optimal current
increased output power by about 30 percent.  In fact, turning the knob up
killed lasing entirely at normal line voltage.
<p>
So, as it stands now, the output is about 0.57 mW after warmup at optimal
current.  I expect this can be improved with additional cleaning of the
Brewster windows and mirrors, but I'll leave that to Phil.  The rubber boots
also don't seal very well but are better than nothing for now.  A new set
would be a good idea.
<p>
I built an input voltage reducer from an HVAC control transformer so
the input to the SP-130B is now about 75 to 80 VAC and the knob actually
peaks the output power about 3/4 of the way up.  The transformer is wired
with its dual primary windings in series to produce about 59 VAC from the
centertap, and 17 V is added to this from its secondary (now running at
1/2 the normal voltage).  I wanted to put this inside the SP-130B
case but there simply is no room.  A purely resistive voltage reducer
would dissipate significant power and even for that, there is no room.
<p>
Conclusions: This laser is now operational.  At present, the output power
is somewhat low but this is almost certainly in part due to the need for
additional optics cleaning, and also due to being overfilled.  While not
quite as totally authentic vintage as SP-130B #3, it is close.  The glasswork
is very unobtrusive so the only tell-tail indication of rework is the
dead getter since there was no way to open it up without admitting air,
and no way to install a new one without more time and effort than could
be justified.
<p>
Thus, I know now of 2 working SP-130/B lasers in the Universe! :)

<h3><A NAME="htrt991">Two Melles Griot HeNe Laser Heads with Terminal
 Sputtering Disease</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: A pair of 05-LHR-991 (10 mW) HeNe laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Hard starting, low output, discharge color too white.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.1 to 1.0 mW and erratic.
 <li>Optimal current: Off scale.
 <li>Beam quality: Good.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Just attempting to run these tubes on my test power
 supply was a real treat.  They just barely started with the Variac cranked up
 to 140 VAC, and then only if the humidity was low and positive leads insulated
 except at the tube anode.  Operating voltage is probably somewhat high as
 well.  (This supply will easily run longer higher power tubes.)
</ul>
<p>
These were probably nice high power laser heads at some point in the past but
now were clearly in deep trouble.  (Thankfully, someone else had already
removed the HeNe tubes from the aluminum cylinders so the diagnosis could be
made a lot more easily.)  At first I thought the gas fill was contaminated
somehow (because of the funny white-ish color) and even went so far as to try
activating the getter with my Solar furnace with no change at all.
<p>
The key symptom which didn't register at first but is obvious in retrospect
were several silvery metallic spots around the tube next to the cathode
end-cap/mirror mount.  On many Melles Griot tubes, the cathode has a set of
4 holes punched through it equally spaced around its periphery.  Normally,
it is possible to vide the interior of the cathode and end of the bore through
these holes.  Not now.  What the metallic spots must be are deposits of
aluminum on the glass due to very serious sputtering taking place inside
the cathode.  Inspecting the bore as best I could (until an autopsy can be
performed), it would also appear as expected that there are similar deposits
on it near the end inside the cathode can.  Whether the sputtering was simply
from normal end-of-life when the cathode can pickling (oxide) gets used up,
from some manufacturing defect, or from abuse, I do not know.  The laser
heads had closely spaced serial numbers so it's possible they were from a
bad batch, or just from a set of lasers shipped to the same customer and
used under similar circumstances.
<p>
Unfortunately, prognosis is poor and salvaging the organs for transplant (e.g.,
the mirrors) may be in their future. :)

<h3><A NAME="htrf201">Four Melles Griot HeNe Laser Heads with Broken
 Bores</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: Four 05-LHR-201 (5 mW) HeNe laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Bore broken between spider and cathode, low/no output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 to 1.0 mW and erratic.
 <li>Optimal current: 6.5 mA.
 <li>Beam quality: Good.
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> One of the tubes had been removed from its laser head
 cylinder before I received it so making the general diagnosis was trivial.
 Before powering up, I tapped on each head while observing the bore from the
 cathode-end.  On all four tubes, the bores were jammed down into the cathode
 end-cap - which conveniently helped to stabilize them somewhat.  Then, they
 were each powered up to determine condition.  Depending on orientation,
 jiggling, tapping, etc., power would vary from 0.0 mW to 1.0 mW.
<p>
 The usual cause of such trauma is either all four having been dropped onto
 a concrete floor without adequate padding or passing too deep into
 the gravity well of a neutron star or black hole. :)
</ul>
<p> 
All four of these laser heads must have suffered some terrible trauma though
there was no external evidence of bruises, scratches, scrapes, or dents.
Perhaps an entire rack of HeNe heads had dropped to the floor. :(  The
location of the breaks were also interesting.  On these tubes, the bore is
supported at three places: the fused glass at the anode-end; the main spider
about mid-way, and another spider which is part of the cathode.  The breaks
were between the two spiders, right at the main spider on the one sample that
was naked, probably the same place on the others though I haven't extracted
them yet.  It's also possible that the double spiders in close proximity
resulted in too much stress or a peculiar resonance under the wrong
conditions.  The bore is made of very thick glass and its extension into
the cathode isn't that long.  However, these are the frosted variety (inside
and out) which I imagine to be weaker than those of similar size which is made
of polished glass.
<p>
By tweaking the mirror mounts while the tubes were oriented optimally, I was
actually able to get one sample up to 2.75 mW which was stable as long as the
tube wasn't moved or rotated.  The others peaked at 1.0, 0.6, and 0.25 mW
respectively.
<p>
Except for the 2.75 mW tube, the others are destined for my organ, err, mirror
bank.  I'll probably pull the 2.75 mW tube from its cylinder and keep it as
a sort of curiosity and warning to any other HeNe heads that might be tempted
toward recklessness. :)

 Gas Leakage Disease</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: SP-120 with very gassy tube.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Red/blue discharge, Uck. :)
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Optimal current: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> The laser head was run on my HeNe laser test power
 supply for several hours with no improvement.
</ul>
<p>
With a diagnosis of terminal gas leakage disease, the only course of action
is a tube transplant.  Fortunately, I had another good tube (in a resonator)
for this purpose.  Either the bare tube or the entire resonator could be
replaced.  I chose to remove the entire resonator and install my spare intact
rather than swap tubes since it is slightly lower risk but a replacement tube
can be installed in about 5 minutes without requiring anything more than a
touch-up of mirror alignment.
<p>
The transplant went smoothly with the patient making a spectacular recovery. :)
<p>
CAUTION: Don't be tempted to touch any of the coarse mirror alignment screws
(the ones at 120 degrees around the mirror mount flanges - their setting is
very critical and if you lose the beam, alignment from scratch will probably
be needed.  Use the pan and tilt screws (in the end-plates, on horizontally
either side  of the mirror mount flange) for all alignment.  These shift the
center of the bore with respect to the curved mirrors.  If you can't get a
a beam, the tube is bad, the Brewster windows or mirrors are dirty, or someone
else messed with the coarse adjustment screws!

<h3><A NAME="htrsp12b">Spectra-Physics Model 120 HeNe Laser Head with Moderate
 Gas Leakage Disease</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: SP-120 with somewhat gassy tube.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Overly pink discharge.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
<ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Optimal current: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
</ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> The laser head was run on my HeNe laser test power

</ul>
<p>
This SP-120 has a getter electrode but no obvious getter spot.  Since every
other SP-120 tube I've ever seen had a very noticeable metallic getter spot
if still good, or the "white cloud of death" spot if beyond hope, I can only
assume that for some reason or just lack of quality control, the getter in
this tube was never fired - that may be an option if needed.
<p>
The laser came in with no signs of lasing at any reasonable current setting
but after 10 minutes of a steady 6.5 mA drip, coherent red photons started
appearing in small quantities.  Patient's chart of accumulated treatment time:
<p>
<PRE>
      Arrival  0.2 hour  3 hours   13 hours  24 hours  34 hours

</PRE>
<p>
The output power of 4.6 mW is less than 65 to 75 percent of what a new SP-120
will produce at a current of 6.5 mA.  Presently, the tube <i>will</i> output
5 mW at 7.50 mA and 6 mW at 9 mA.  But I don't know the recommended maximum
current for the SP-120 and 9 mA was still not the peak, rather the limit
of my power supply.  In any case, 6.5 mA is always a safe value for this
size HeNe laser.  Although the other SP-120 tubes I've tested also peaked
at a current higher than 6.5 mA (I don't recall what it was), as noted,
their output was still much greater at 6.5 mA than the patient.  Though
5 mW output at 7.5 mA might actually meet spec, treatment will continue
for a few more days. :)

<h3><A NAME="htrsp907">Spectra-Physics Model 907 With No Output</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: SP-907.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: No output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Patient was run on my SP-255 (after initial repairs)
 and produced no output even with gentle pressing on mirror mounts.
</ul>
<p>
The SP-907 is the OEM version of the SP-127/107 laser tube and resonator
with an overall length of more than 38 inches and a nominal output power of
35 mW.  This patient came in with a cut power cable, broken cathode-end
ballast resistor tube (only really affects appearance), and no power supply.
The SP-207 (both linear and switchmode versions) is the recommended exciter
but I don't have one.  So, I had to adapt my SP-255 to the task.
<p>
First, I just connected it as best I could with alligator clip leads to see
if the laser would do anything.  It didn't even flash with the input voltage
cranked up to 140 VAC on a Variac.  (The SP-255 is a linear power supply
so boosting the input would boost the starting and running voltages as well.)
I wasn't particularly surprised as the SP-907 tube is about 50 percent longer
than the SP-124 for which the SP-255 is designed.
<p>
On a hunch, I grounded the frame as it was not grounded originally.  Then,
exactly once, it started and continued to run until I backed the Variac down
below 110 VAC or so.  However, while lit, there was no sign of red output.
The discharge color looked reasonable - perfect in fact - so this confirmed
that the tube was gas intact and had no serious leakage.  (A small getter
spot was also present and looked reasonable as well.  I don't know if the
rest of the getter spot turned clear when used up of if this small spot was
all there was.)
<p>
But I couldn't get the tube started this way again no matter how long I held
my breath. :)
<p>
As a test I wired the tube backwards since with reverse polarity, the starting
voltage is often somewhat lower though the operating voltage is higher.  With
this arrangement, it would occasionally flash but that's about it.
<p>
Next, I returned the wiring to the correct polarity and applied some RF from
my flyback HV widget via a strip of aluminum foil to the bore trying a few
different places.  When in contact with it relatively near the anode-end
of the tube, the laser would flash on momentarily with the Variac to the
SP-255 cranked all the way up but would never "catch".
<p>
By accident, I did find out one interesting thing: If left alone for an hour
or more, applying the full 140 VAC to the exciter suddenly without slowly
turning the knob up on the Variac would result in it starting.  But, only
if allowed to sit for that hour (or longer).  Hmmmm... Maybe it likes the
output to climb quickly from near 0 V to its starting voltage, this somehow
coupling via the tube capacitance and initiating the discharge.  To verify
this, I took a 400K ohm resistor and carefully discharged both the power
supply and laser tube capacitance.  And, presto!  The tube started even
without the hour's wait.  In fact, it would now start at 125 VAC or sometimes
even 115 VAC after only the time it took to apply the resistor.
<p>
Great!  So, I added a 200M ohm bleeder resistor across the power supply
output and attached a nice Alden cable to the laser head.  This enabled it
to start and run reliably but it might require 125 VAC for starting after
which it could be backed off to 115 VAC while running to reduce stress on
the SP-255 pass-bank.  Later, I added an external pod with a stage of boost
circuitry to increase the SP-255 starting voltage.  (See the
section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp31">Enhancements to SP-255</A>.)
This eliminated all starting problems and the need for the Variac.  I
set the operating current at 10 mA which should be enough (11.5 mA is
nominal but I'd rather run it a bit low until later).
<p>
I did dust off the Brewster windows - at least they are accessible after
pulling back a rubber boot (unlike the SP-120 where it's impossible to
clean them in place).  No change.
<p>
At this point, it is almost certain that the major problem is mirror alignment.
I emailed the person I got it from and asked: "Before I attempt to align this
beast, do you know if the mirrors have been touched?".  Reply: "Well, maybe
someone attempted to peak the power and totally lost alignment."  "Duh,
thanks for telling me." :)
<p>
My first approach was to use the "bore sight" method of mirror alignment
because I felt there was no way to get a HeNe alignment beam cleanly down
the bore.  The "bore sight" method allows all alignment to be done by
reflecting from the mirrors externally, using a pair of cards with small
holes positioned at the tube's axis to align the alignment laser to the
tube.  (See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir3">Major Problems
with Mirror Alignment</A>, earlier in this chapter.)
<p>
I used my trusty little 05-LHR-911 HeNe laser head on an adjustable platform
to align its beam through the cards, which had previously each had a hole
drilled precisely at the location of the center of the SP-907's mirrors.
This worked reasonably well for the OC-end and confirmed that the OC mirror
was way out of alignment - by 1 or 2 whole turns of the 1/4-28 adjustment
nuts!  (There would be no lasing on this long a resonator if the nut was
off by even 1/10th of a turn!)  So, someone really messed things up. :(
<p>
However, I didn't count on what I found next: The outer surface of the
HR mirror is coarse-ground (frosted), not polished, so there is no way
to reflect a beam from it which this method of alignment requires.  Why
did SP do that? :(
<p>
So plan A didn't work.
<p>
Plan B is to do everything from the OC-end starting with removing
both the HR and OC mirror mounts (just 3 nuts each so at least that's
easy) and start by getting as much of my HeNe alignment laser beam
through the bore, then installing the HR and aligning for a reflection
back from there, and put the OC in and do the same.
<p>
I fabricated some precise micrometer (80 tpi, the mirror adjusters from a
large ion laser) adjustment plates and attached these (2 screws at one end,
1 screw at the other) to the laser head.  This will provide the degree of
control I need to align the tube's bore with the alignment beam.  Providing
fine pitch screws centered at each mirror of the laser being aligned rather
than on the alignment laser results in a much more intuitive setup since
there is almost no interaction between adjustments.
<p>
Finally we have lasing!
<p>
What a pain.  In addition to the mirrors being all out of alignment, there
are adjustments on bore straightness which were also messed up and it was
was impossible to get any resemblance of a clean beam down the bore from
my HeNe alignment laser.  But, with a bit of careful tweaking, a spot was
detected on the wall acting as a screen that was clearly from the alignment
beam.  Then, I replaced the OC mirror mount and aligned its back-reflection to
coincide with the HeNe alignment laser's aperture, with dancing interference
patterns.  Finally, replacing the HR mirror mount and after a few minutes
of gentle rocking, flashes where detected.  :)  Once a stable position was
found for the HR (just sitting on the rods), the OC mirror was carefully
adjusted to maximize power - still probably less than 1 mW.  Then, the HR
mirror mount nuts and washers were installed and carefully adjusted to
tighten up the mount, never losing sight of the beam!  Finally, I walked the
mirrors to peak power.  I will say one thing, these mirror adjustments are
very smooth and repeatable with little backlash even though the entire range
of lasing is probably less than 1/10th turn on the nuts.
<p>
Note that I didn't follow the original Plan B procedure exactly taking the
short cut of using the OC back-reflection to align it first rather than
attempting to get a clean return beam back down the bore from the HR.
Fortunately, it was successful.
<p>
This SP-907 currently peaks at 18+ mW but will probably do 25 mW, maybe
more, when run at the optimum current (it's still at 10 mA) with a proper
cleaning of the Brewster windows - which is still a pain since they attract
all sorts of stuff as soon as they are cleaned, and my operating suite isn't
exactly a Class-100 clean room.  Power typically drops way down just pushing
the rubber boots back in place because that dislodges dust and guess where
it goes! :)  The mirrors could probably also use some cleaning but I'm not
inclined to tackle those just yet.
<p>
I have since done this same thing on a totally non-lasing SP-907.  Even with
only a foot or so between the alingment laser and the OC, it was enough to
get flashes when jiggling the HR.

<h3><A NAME="htrmggr1">Melles Griot GreNe with No Output</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: 05-LGR-170.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: No output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Patient was run for a short while but
 produced no output even with gentle pressing on mirror mounts.
 Discharge color is pink and dim.
</ul>
<p>
This green HeNe laser tube came from a self-contained rectangular
Melles Griot laser, "GreNe" model 05-SGR-871, about 24 inches long with
an internal brick power supply (which appears to work fine).  The
tube is interesting in that it has a frit (hard) seal at the
cathode-end but an Epoxy (soft) seal at the anode-end.  This was
probably done to reduce thermal stress (in the frit oven) on the
very delicate OC mirror.  In fact, I am in contact with the person
who may actually have worked on the design or manufacturing of this
laser at Melles Griot. :)
<p>
Normally with a green (or other "other-color") HeNe laser tube
having a discharge color/gas fill problem, there is little hope
of recovery.  The gain is so low that even trace contamination
results in no output at all.  However, for some reason, I got
the feeling that this one was close enough to warrant some effort.
<p>
Regardless of treatment options, the tube had to be removed from
the chassis.  This required unscrewing two aluminum mounting blocks,
unscrewed some nylon set-screws, and pealing away at the black RTV
Silicone holding the tube in place.  This accomplished, Mr. GreNe
was moved to my diagnostic facility (e.g., my adjustable HeNe laser
power supply, tapped ballast resistor, and current meter).
<p>
Initially, the tube operating voltage was about 20 percent low and
variable - getting even lower as the tube warmed up.  The color
was obviously wrong but I suspected that there was still some hope.
It was very pink but not deep red or blue.
<p>
So, the first treatment procedure was to run the tube for awhile to
see if that alone would result in at least some recovery.  And, each
time the tube was powered-on, the discharge color showed some definite
improvement, though after running for a few minutes, it would tend to
return to its former condition.
<p>
However, after a total of about 8 hours of a 6.5 mA IV drip over several
days, a few green photons started appearing for about 30 seconds shortly
after powering up.  During that time, I gently pressed on the cathode-end
mirror to determine if alignment could be improved.  It seemed fairly
decent though I would tweak it later.  Successive power cycles (with
a cool-down period) appeared to result in somewhat more green output and
for a longer time.
<p>
I then applied several radiation treatments to the getter from my solar
heater.  I just set up the tube so a part of the getter ring was at the
focus of the solar heater (about 1/4" focal spot from a 7"x10" or so
Fresnel lens) and let it bake for a few minutes.  Probably a total of
1/2 hour in a half dozen sessions of that around noon on a cloudless day,
powering up in between to check condition. :)  After a few of those, there
is no further improvement.  That is the basically the same thing
I did to a contaminated red HeNe tube over a year ago (see the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrrnlt">Repairing the Northern Lights Tube</A>)
but that was hard-sealed (it is still doing fine).
<p>
I tweaked the alignment of the HR (cathode-end) mirror using the three-screw
adjuster that was already there.  That increased the output by about 10
percent.  The adjustments were not super critical (as would be the case
with a tube having marginal gain) and were repeatable.  The beam is TEM00
and nice and circular.
<p>
Following the solar treatments, there was a sustained green output between
0.4 mW (when first powered) dropping to about 0.32 mW steady state with
very little power variation due to mode sweeping.  The operating voltage
has stabilized, probably close to its spec'd value, changing only very
slightly during warmup.  The discharge color now looks normal for a red
HeNe tube, maybe a bit more saturated red than usual but it is stable and
hasn't changed with additional getter treatments.  (The color may be normal.
If I recall correctly, the discharge color of my green 1-B HeNe laser tube
looks similar.)  The color in the expanded section of the bore near the anode
is close to a normal orange.  I suppose with the Epoxy seal, helium has likely
leaked out in addition to air leaking in.  Low helium pressure might explain
both the discharge color (if it's really incorrect) and somewhat low output
(a modern 05-LGR-170 tube is rated at 0.8 mW but see below).  After running
for a few more hours, the power has stabilized around 0.4 mW with little
change during warmup.  This probably means that additional benefits from
doing anything with the getter will be negligible.
<p>
However, I'm going to run the tube for a few more days.  The power
still appears to be climbing - very slowly but steadily.  Though at
this rate, it may be a few years before the tube achieves rated power.
If that doesn't help after a few days, I will perform a helium soak.
It should be a simple matter to enclose the anode-end only in a plastic
bag filled with helium and even be able to power the tube to check progress.
There is little risk of overfilling doing this for a couple weeks (the
manufacturing date of the laser is 1988 and this is almost certainly the
original tube) - 1 day for every year of age.  For now, I have reinstalled
the tube in the laser case using the set-screws but no RTV Silicone so it
can be removed if needed.  According to my contact at Melles Griot, it's
possible that this laser had a minimum power spec of only 0.2 mW.  Mr.
GreNe is already doing twice that. :)
<p>
Followup: After a year or so of occasionally turning the laser on for a few
minutes to check that it still worked, I must have missed a couple months
with the result that there was no green output at all.  However, letting it
run for a several hours restored it to nearly the same health, without needing
any getter treatments.  So, indeed the recommendation to run a soft-seal HeNe
laser tube periodically is confirmed!

<h3><A NAME="htrmggr2">Melles Griot Long GreNes with No Output</A></h3>

  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.

<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Checking (discharge) color, appeared correct
 shade but possibly very slightly pale.  Patients were run for awhile at
 a 6.5 mA drip to determine if any gas cleanup would take place.  Even
 though these are hard-seal tubes, after a long period of non-use, slight
 contamination can creep in.  The cathode acts as a slow getter in this case.
</ul>
<p>
These are rather long green (543.5 nm) HeNe laser tubes, possibly Melles
Griot 05-LGR-191 or -193 (or their predecessor).  At first I thought they
were possibly designed to be multimode since the bores appear quite wide
compared to even other TEM00 red tubes of similar length and the operating
voltage is also rather low.  I'd expect the rated output power to
be several mW, possibly as high as 5 mW if this is the case.  Should they
turn out to be 05-LGR-193 tubes, the rated power would be 2 mW minimum.
This is about the highest power of any currently manufactured green HeNe
laser.  However, I've been told that older tubes that look similar to these
might only have a rated output power of a few tenths of a mW.  And, these
are probably rather old.
<p>
The next test was to check mirror alignment.  Using the "Instalign" procedure
described in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrsiap">Sam's Instalign(tm)
Procedure for Internal Mirror Tube Mirror Alignment</A> revealed that
someone must have attempted to break the legs of these tubes.  The cathode-end
mirrors were so far out of alignment that the pointing error could be seen
with the naked eye and the reflected spot of the alignment laser wobbled by
several degrees as the tube was rotated.  This is far beyond what the locking
collars could correct, so they were removed and a steel plate that fit in
the restricted region of the the mirror mount was used to gradually restore
the mounts to something approaching correct alignment - where there was no
detectable wobble in the reflected beam.  This is somewhat hard to determine
due to the multiple reflections but the smallest spot is from the outer
planar surface and this was used as an initial guide.  Note that since there
might be some wedge in the mirror, this technique alone may not be sufficient
to achieve close enough alignment.  The same was done with the anode-end
mirror, but it appeared to be much closer to proper alignment, possibly
because the butcher, err, surgeon who had these tubes previously didn't
want to mess with the high voltage!
<p>
The patients were retested but still found to be lacking in any green output.
<p>
The next step was to use the alignment laser to shoot a beam down the length
of the bore.  Fortunately, these particular tubes have a very wide bore for
their size and doing this was not difficult.  To actually optimize alignment,
the reflection all the way back from the far mirror was used - just visible
as a tiny dot of light when centered.  There are actually multiple reflections
but gently rocking the far mirror while observing the reflected pattern
revealed when the far mirror was fairly well aligned.  The tube was then
turned 180 degrees and the same thing repeated.
<p>
The patients were again retested but still found to be lacking in any green
output.  Rocking either mirror didn't have any effect.  So, one of the
patients (designated Patient #1) was selected for extended 6.5 mA therapy
and put on the power supply for several hours.
<p>
Finally, pressing on one of the mirror mounts resulted in a flash of green
light!  Some quick work with the steel plate, and then with the locking collars
and it could be somewhat sustained, though still very weak.  And, almost
*everything* affected the output power.  Usually, the beam was TEM00, but
both TEM01 and TEM11 modes were observed at times.  Mirror walking succeeded
in improving the situation somewhat, but not dramatically.  Adding magnets
also increased the output power, though probably not by enough to justify
the effort required to install them permanently.  The output power
appears to peak with a current between 6.0 and 6.5 mA.  Patient #1 was
allowed to run for several more hours.  While no dramatic improvement has
taken place, the output is much more consistent and 50 to 100 microwatts
of green photons can be maintained indefinitely.
<p>
The other tube, Patient #2, was retweaked for alignment several times before
it finally started lasing, but with somewhat better results.  After mirror
walking, up to 0.4 mW of output power could be maintained consistently.
<p>
While the output of even the healthier of these tubes is likely
below its spec'd value, getting *any* green tube to lase can be quite a
challenge.  Not being mounted in any sort of thermally controlled enclosure
(like a cylindrical laser head) doesn't help the situation as any low gain
HeNe laser tube will be subject to significant power fluctuations if left
in the open.  Although I've seen multimode output from these tubes when
the mirror alignment wasn't optimal, they are probably in fact designed
to be TEM00.  The beam diameter is approximately 1 mm but it's difficult to
measure precisely to the 1/e points and it could be slightly smaller
and consistent with the 05-LGR-191 or -193.  These tubes are now probably
fairly stable, if tired, but still good enough for a cool demo.

<h3><A NAME="htrmgyl1">Melles Griot Yellow Laser Head With No Output</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: 05-LYR-173.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: No output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Patient was powered up for observation.  Starting
 behavior, and operating voltage and current appear normal.
</ul>
<p>
This laser head actually has a Coherent label, but is obviously made my
Melles Griot since it is physically identical in every way, shape, and form,
to an 05-LYR-173.  It was purchased on eBay by a friend of mine.  The
eBay listing said it was working, even having a stated output power of
4.2 mW.  But the laser head was received in its present dead state.  A
replacement was sent to him which worked fine and the seller didn't want
this one back.  So, I was asked if I wanted it or should he throw it away!
Throw it away!  Geez! :)  What a question.  It arrived packed in the
original foam cushioned Coherent box.  You could drop that out of an airplane
and the laser head wouldn't even feel it.  But the power supply brick was
also in there when shipped from seller to buyer, so maybe that was bouncing
against the head during the entire trip!
<p>
Since the operating voltage and current behavior are normal, that only leaves
a few possible causes.  It could be a high mileage head which is now simply
not lasing.  Or, the mirror alignment could somehow have been knocked out
in shipping, despite the padding.  Possibly the bore shifted position slightly
which would result in symptoms similar to misaligned mirrors.
<p>
So, after removing the front end-cap, modest finger pressure was applied
to the mirror mount.  And, presto - a flash of yellow!  Some quick work with
my custom HeNe laser mirror adjusting tool and what's this?  5 mW?  Is that
accurate?  How can that be?  A bit more effort and allowing for complete
warmup and, can you believe: 5.7 mW at 6.5 mA and more than 5.9 mW at 7 mA.
This has got to be the liveliest yellow HeNe laser head for its size I've
ever seen.  The beam is identical in every respect to that of the yellow
laser described in the next section - single transverse mode TEM00, and single
line (594.1 nm only, confirmed with diffraction grating as well as
somewhat calibrated monochronometer).  What's more, its
stability in terms of power fluctuations with warmup is better than many
similar size red HeNe lasers climbing smoothly after starting out at about
4 mW when cold showing less than 2 percent p-p mode sweep variation in
between.
<p>
The sensitivity of output power to finger pressure on the mirror is higher
than that other physically identical (but not as lively) yellow laser head.
But once adjusted, it appears to stay put and has remained unchanged for
several months.  Perhaps the curvature of the mirrors is different and/or
they are of higher quality.
<p>
Even someone who had worked for many years in the HeNe laser division of
Melles Griot and built "other color" HeNe lasers couldn't believe it,
insisting the laser must be multimode or multiline or something else, arguing
that the gain at 594.1 nm isn't that much different than at 543.5 nm (green)
and green laser heads of similar size don't generally exceed 2 mW.
So output power nearly triple that is at least somewhat unusual.  I've heard
of 7 or 10 mW yellow lasers, but they were typically much longer.  However,
since the CDRH sticker rating is 10 mW, I guess that sort of power was
expected.  Otherwise, it would have been listed as only 5 mW.  I asked
if Melles Griot was holding out the good stuff for Coherent since the
highest power yellow HeNe laser they sell - the 05-LYR-173 - is only
rated at 2 mW. :)
<p>
However, it turns out that exact laser used to be listed on the
Coherent Web site.  And from the listed specifications, it was clear
that the laser head is identical to the
Melles Griot 05-LYR-173 and therefore must be manufactured by Melles Griot.
(Coherent no longer sells any HeNe lasers.)
<p>
Awhile later I did check the operating voltage of this laser head and it
is definitely lower then the spec'd value of the 05-LYR-173.  In fact, it's
even lower than the operating voltage of the 05-LYR-171 which is rated at
only 1 mW.  For the genuine 05-LYR-173, the operating voltage is listed as
2,590 V.  However, for this Coherent yellow head, I measured about 2,500 V.
That 90 V may not sound like much of a difference but it's unusual to measure
a <i>lower</i> operating voltage than the spec'd value at rated current.
(A similar measurement of a low mileage 05-LYR-171 matched its specs
exactly at 2,520 V.  It's also possible the 2,590 number is wrong as
the tube in the 05-LYR-171 and 05-LYR-173 appear to be physically identical
but possibly the latter has a 78K ballast instead of 68K ballast since that
is what's recommended for the bare tube.)  In any case, even if the difference
in voltage is only 20 V, perhaps the Coherent tube uses a slightly modified
recipe that pushes the envelope on TEM00 performance, possibly at the expense
of mirror adjustment stability.  My testing wasn't in depth enough to
determine if the beam diameter and divergence are eaactly the same for
both lasers.  However, from the fact that the model is only listed as
2 mW, I rather doubt there is any difference.  Possibly it was simply from
a batch of really lively laser tubes!
<p>
The cause for the initially dead state is also a unknown.  The mounting
orientation of the laser head has little effect on output power and some
gentle tapping evokes no response.  This is a relatively new laser
(manufacturing date of 2000) so it should have the molded-in-glass
bore supports which can't deform like the older thin
metal spiders.  Thus, it's not clear how the bore could move from any physical
shock.  The mirrors are the normal metal tube extensions with a narrowed
section for adjustment, with no locking collars.  There is no way a mirror
could just decide to move on its own from any amount of physical abuse that
wouldn't totally destroy the tube.  I was told that the power supply brick
was included in the same box without padding and might have whacked the
head during shipping, but that sounds unlikely as a cause.
<p>
So, this too will remain a pleasant mystery for now.

<h3><A NAME="htrmgyl2">Melles Griot Yellow Laser Head With Variable Output</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: 05-LYR-171.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Output power varies by 40 percent over a cycle with a
 period that starts out short and increases in length as the laser warms up.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 1.8 to 2.8 mW (after 10 minute warmup).
  <li>Optimal current: 6.5 mA.
  <li>Beam quality: Excellent.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Patient was powered up for observation.   Starting
 behavior, and operating voltage and current appear normal.
</ul>
<p>
The output power varies smoothly in what appears to be close to a sinusoidal
manner with a period many times longer than the normal (much lower amplitude)
mode sweep variation.  It is very obviously related to thermal expansion since
the period gets longer and longer during warmup.
<p>
There is no obvious cause.  With the front end-cap removed, pressing gently on
mirror shows that it is well aligned whether the power is min or max or
anywhere in between.  Applying magnet therapy to check for the presence of
the competing 3.39 um IR line has absolutely no effect.
<p>
This laser head was surplus and came from a source that made it available as a
laser known to not meet listed specifications but considered suitable for some
purposes and therefore not "recycled".  The output power at all times is still
well above the rated minimum for the 05-LYR-171 of 1.0 mW but the variation in
output power is four times the acceptable mode sweep specification of 10
percent.
<p>
It appears to be brand new, a factory reject due to the power variation
problem.  The magnet test pretty much rules out 3.39 um competition, though
the longer period of the variation is more consistent with this cause than
anything else considered up to this point.  The mirrors appear to be
well aligned and stable.  Low gain would result in a variation
at the mode sweep rate which is much higher than what was observed.  The
mode sweep variation of a few percent is superimposed on the much larger
long period variation and appears normal.
<p>
Tests that were performed include the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>IR (3.39 um) mode competition:</b> This was the most
 likely cause based on the behavior with a long period smooth variation.
 Powerful disk drive magnets were placed in various positions next to the
 laser head cylinder but with minimal or no effect.  With other laser heads
 having these symptoms, magnets placed in almost any position would have
 a very noticeable effect.  In addition, the ratio of the normal mode cycling
 period to the power variation period was measured to be 1:25 to 1:30.
 I would have expected it to be around 594.1:3,390 or 5.7 or possibly double
 this.
<p>
<li><b>Mirror alignment:</b> The OC (front) mirror was adjusted for maximum
 output power.  There was no evidence of instability or unexpected output
 power fluctuations.
<p>
<li><b>Marginal multiple (transverse) mode:</b> If the mirror/bore recipe was
 incorrect, the beam could be jumping from TEM00 to multimode due to thermal
 expansion or random chance.  However, there is no evidence of a multimode
 beam even when sent 18 or 20 feet across the room, nor any positional
 instability.
<p>
<li><b>Generation of rogue wavelength(s):</b> Orange (604.6 or 611.9 nm) or
 red (632.8 nm) lines could periodically rob power from the desired yellow
 (594.1 nm) line.  If these were exiting the HR (rear) mirror, then there
 would be little evidence from the front of the laser.  However, later tests
 confirm that there are no rogue wavelengths in the HR waste beam.
<p>
<li><b>Effects of tube current:</b> The operating current was adjusted above
 and below the recommended (6.5 mA) value at both min and max points on the
 output power curve.  There was no unusual behavior - the output power
 increased slightly with increasing current in a manner identical to that
 of similar properly functioning yellow HeNe laser heads.  I assume these
 are filled at a reduced pressure and/or higher He:Ne fill ratio resulting
 in the output peaking above the recommended operating current or having
 no distinct peak within the safe range of tube current.
<p>
<li><b>Polarization:</b> A polarizer was put in between the laser and
 power meter and rotated to produce the largest fluctuations during
 mode cycling.  The changes are rather large (perhaps 20 to 30 percent)
 and sometimes very rapid.  But this could be normal since only about one half
 the number of modes are present in the polarized beam.
<p>
<li><b>Output from rear mirror:</b> This one is the key.  The rear end-cap
 was removed allowing the waste beam from the HR mirror to be measured.
 The output power from the rear (HR) mirror varies from 1.3 to 1.8 mW as
 the output power from the front (OC) mirror varies from 2.8 to 1.8 mW.
 Note the inverse relationship.  The total power from both ends of the tube
 ranges from about 3.6 to 4.1 mW, all at 594.1 nm  The beam from the
 rear mirror represents a very large amount of power that would normally
 be wasted, especially for a low gain yellow HeNe laser where every
 last photon is valuable.  This suggests that one problem at least is that
 the coating on the HR mirror is incorrect.  The center wavelength probably
 shifted a few nm during processing.  Apparently, such goofs aren't
 that unusual for these highly selective mirrors, though they are generally
 caught during initial testing and the mirrors end up in the garbage.  Finding
 one in a finished, packaged, production laser <i>is</i> somewhat unusual.
<p>
 However, a bad coating alone still wouldn't explain the behavior.  The
 increased loss from a low reflectivity HR mirror should simply increase
 power out from the HR and decrease power out from the OC.  But when the
 wavelengths are the same, as in this case, any power variation with mode
 cycling and warmup should more or less track front and rear, not be
 closer to the inverse.
<p>
 Polarization and beam profile were also checked for the output from the
 rear mirror and found to be similar to those from the front mirror.
<p>
 But the clincher is that <i>no</i> ghost beam was observed from the HR
 mirror even though its outer surface is not anti-reflection (AR) coated!
 So, the mirror substrate was ground without any wedge.  Thus, the reflection
 from its non-AR coated planar outer surface returns <i>directly</i> back into
 the laser cavity.  Most HeNe laser mirrors are ground with a slight wedge
 to prevent this situation.  Without wedge, the parallel surfaces
 of the HR mirror form an external Fabry-Perot etalon or second resonant
 cavity.  When the distance between the two surfaces of the HR mirror
 is a multiple of 1/2 wavelength (possibly plus 1/4 wavelength since the outer
 surface is to a lower index of refraction) of a lasing mode, the effective
 reflectivity of the HR mirror will be a maximum.  Whey they are 1/4 wavelength
 thinner or thicker, the effective reflectivity of the HR mirror will be a
 maximum.  This will modulate the waste beam power by up to a theoretical
 maximum of 2.25:1 (assuming an HR with R very close to 1 and 4% from its
 outer surface).  Although at first it might appear as though there
 is some fixed relation between the period of the slow variation in power and
 the faster mode cycling (as there would be if the cause were mode competition
 from 3.39 um IR), this will only be true if the mirror and tube are
 expanding (in optical length terms) at the same rate.  Why?
 Since the lasing modes get recycled - when one falls off the low
 end of the gain curve, another appears at the high end - the actual
 wavelength spread of the lasing modes doesn't really change and the slow power
 variation would still occur even if the tube itself were held at a constant
 temperature and only the temperature of the HR mirror were allowed to
 increase.  Or, to put it another way, the optical frequency of all lasing
 modes remains within a very small range - the 1.5 GHz envelope of the neon
 gain bandwidth curve - but the modes of the external etalon shift with
 temperature.
<p>
 So, the relevant calculations are to determine (1) how the transmission
 function of the weak etalon of the HR mirror varies with temperature and
 to determine (2) the approximate number of waste beam variation cycles
 and mode sweep cycles.
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>The general transmission equation for a Fabry-Perot (plane parallel)
  etalon with arbitrary mirror reflectivities is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
                 (1-R<sub>1</sub>)(1-R<sub>2</sub>)
  T = ----------------------------------
       [1-(R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>+4(R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>sin<sup>2</sup>(phi)
</PRE>
<p>
  Where:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>T = power transmission (Pout/Pin).
  <li>R<sub>1</sub> = reflectivity of mirror 1.
  <li>R<sub>2</sub> = reflectivity of mirror 2.
  <li>phi = phase shift for a round trip.
  </ul>
<p>
  This equation reduces to the more common one found via a Web search if
  R=R<sub>1</sub>=R<sub>2</sub>.  And indeed, since Tmax/Tmin for an etalon
  with R<sub>1</sub> very close to 1 and an arbitrary R<sub>2</sub> is the
  same as for an etalon with the reflectivity of both mirrors equal to
  R=sqrt(R<sub>2</sub>), solving one of those equations for
  R=sqrt(R<sub>2</sub>) will return a nearly identical result
  (though, of course, the actual transmission will differ dramatically!).
<p>
  So, for R<sub>1</sub> being the HR mirror with 99.9%R and
  R<sub>2</sub> being the outer surface with around 4%R, the equation
  reduces to:
<p>
<PRE>
                       0.001 * 0.96                          0.00096
   T = ---------------------------------------------- = ------------------
        [1-(0.999*0.04)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>+4(0.999*0.04)<sup>1/2</sup>sin<sup>2</sup>(phi)    0.64+0.8*sin<sup>2</sup>(phi)
</PRE>
<p>
  So, T varies by a factor of about 2.25 (Tmax/Tmin) due to the sin function
  going from 0 to 1 as phi changes due to thermal expansion of the mirror
  glass.  This is consistent with the experimental data which will be presented
  in the next section.  Note that the exact reflectivity of the HR doesn't
  alter this result by a significant amount as long as R<sub>1</sub> is close
  to 1.  Thus, that ratio of 2.25 for the variation in HR transmission (1-R)
  will be essentially the same for any HeNe laser with a non-wedged but
  ground and polished HR mirror.
<p>
<PRE>
    Condition          Relative T
  ----------------------------------
    Min (phi=90&deg;)         0.67
    No Etalon             1.00
    Max (phi=0&deg;)          1.50
</PRE>
<p>
  But depending on the actual parallellism of the HR surfaces, and the
  condition of its outer surface, the ratio of 2.25:1 may not be achieved.
<p>
<p>
  Note that where the reflectivity of the HR is much closer to 1 than the
  reflectivity of the OC as with most red (632.8 nm) HeNe lasers, the power
  of the small waste beam will vary by a ratio of up to 2.25:1 but the power
  of the much larger main beam will only show very small inverse ripples.
  And the total power from both ends will be essentially constant.
  However, if the reflectivities of the HR and OC are similar - the power
  from both ends will vary significantly, though by much less than that
  ratio of 2.25:1.  For a very low gain laser, the total power will
  also get somewhat smaller as the HR transmission gets higher
  since it is running very near the lasing threshold even under
  the best of conditions.  And in fact, this will be shown to be
  the case based on the test results in the next section.
<p>
  <li>The number of power variation cycles during warmup is given by:
<p>
<PRE>
      Lm * n * (Cex + Cn) * (Tf - Ti)
 N = ---------------------------------
                 2 * &lambda;
</PRE>
<p>
   Where:
<p>
   <ul>
   <li>N = number of power variation cycles.
   <li>Lm = physical length (thickness) of mirror substrate.  (Lm = 4 mm for
    the HR mirror.)
   <li>n = index of refraction.  (n = 1.516 for BK7 at 594 nm.)
   <li>Cex = temperature coefficient of thermal expansion for the mirror
    substrate. (Cex = 7.1x10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C for BK7.)
   <li>Cn = temperature coefficient of absolute index of refraction for the
    mirror substrate.  (Cn averages approximately 2x10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C
    for BK7 in the around 40 &deg;C.)
   <li>Tf = final temperature.
   <li>Ti = initial temperature.
   <li>&lambda; = vacuum wavelength of lasing line. (&lambda; = 594.1 nm.)
   </ul>
<p>
   Assuming the temperature of the mirror climbs from 20 &deg;C to 70 &deg;C
   during warmup, for the 4 mm thick mirror substrate, the optical length will
   increase by about 2.76 um or 9.3 half-wavelengths of 594.1 nm.  That's not
   so far away from the 10 or so full cycles seen during actual experiments.
   Of course, I'm assuming the mirror substrate is made of BK7, didn't
   measure its exact thickness, and guessing about the size of the temperature
   change.  But aside from all that minor hand waving, everything is known
   precisely. :)  However, since the mirror thickness, in particular, may
   differ by 50 percent from one model tube to another, that alone can
   account for a large difference in the number of cycles.
<p>
   Using a similar approach, the number of mode cycles for the main tube
   will be:
<p>
<PRE>
                                     Lc * Cex * (Tf - Ti)
            Number of Mode Cycles = ----------------------
                                            2 * &lambda;
</PRE>
<p>
Where:
<p>
   <ul>
   <li>Lc = Distance between the (cavity) mirrors.  (L = 400 mm for the
    05-LYR-171.)
   <li>Cex = Temperature coefficient of thermal expansion for the tube.
    (Cex = 3.25x10<sup>-6</sup>/&deg;C for borosilicate glass.)
   </ul>
<p>
    For the same temperature rise, the distance between the mirrors will
    increase by about 65 um, corresponding to 219 cycles at 594.1 nm.
  </ol>
<p>
 A Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI) trace of this laser's mode
 structure would probably show significant variations in mode amplitude, even
 though the overall power doesn't vary that much due to the mode cycling.
 That's something that may be performed in the future but my inventory of
 SFPIs doesn't currently include one with mirrors optimized for 594.1 nm.
</ul>
<p>
Based on all these expensive tests (only partially covered by HeNe laser
health insurance), the diagnosis is that the improperly made HR mirror
is resulting in the power balance shifting between the front and rear.
Until this set of tests were performed, IR (3.39 um) mode
competition was at the top of the list, but it has virtually been
ruled out by the mode cycling and power variation period ratios, and
the fact that magnets have little effect on output power.
<p>
One final test was performed to confirm the diagnosis: I touched a cotton
swab soaked with alcohol to the HR mirror about the time when the power of
the main beam was near its maximum value.  The power of the main beam
instantly dropped by between 10 and 20 percent (from about 2.6 mW to 2.2 mW).
The power recovered to near its previous level very quickly as the alcohol
evaporated.  Since the room temperature alcohol also reduced the temperature
of the mirror substrate, that also played a part, but I didn't realize at the
time to check more carefully.  At the time, I also didn't fully realize that
this result was totally consistent with the etalon explanation.  More careful
experiments could have been performed but I wasn't excited about the mess
that might be created by using index matching fluid. :)
<p>
The results of these tests would suggest a cure of sorts:
A wedged optic could be attached to the outer surface of the HR mirror
using index matching optical cement.  The output power variations would then be
if not eliminated, greatly reduced, with the output power of the main beam
beaing about 2.4 mW and the output power of the waste beam being about
1.46 mW.  The output power would be stable, but no where near the top
end of the range.  Even though this would greatly exceed the laser's
specifications, I'm not sure whether this would be a preferred result,
expecially since the laser head would no longer
be very interesting.  Another similar boring cure would be to
add an additional HR behind the whimpy one, perfectly aligned so that
all power gets reflected back into the cavity.  I don't know whether
this could be made stable but have tried some experiments.  While the
results with some specific mirrors were encouraging, these will probably
remain as interesting experiments.  As I found out, due to the low gain
of yellow compared to red, the mirror to be used must be very selective
in order to prevent any red lasing (mostly at 632.8 nm).  For details,
see the next section.  With the most effective mirror, the output from
the front varied from above 3.5 to 4.3 mW of pure yellow (594.1) with a much
reduced waste beam of under 0.3 mW.  A suitable flat
mirror glued to the existing HR might work as a permanent stable solution
since that surface is already (too well) aligned.  But again, the result
would be a boring (but rather lively) laser. :)
<p>
Unless the patient decides on one of these options, no further treatment is
recommended.  The chronic problem is not likely to get any worse or any better
but will continue to be monitored.  I have modified the rear end-cap to allow
the second beam to exit without requiring repeat surgery each time tests are
to be performed.  As I found out, a vital organ (ballast resistor) was in the
way when simply drilling a hole through the end-cap's center.  A transplant
was successful with the new ballast resistor clipped directly to the HR
mirror mount.
<p>
Awhile later, I pulled the rear end-cap off of a healthy 05-LYR-173, a laser
head virtually or totally identical to the 05-LYR-171, except for a power
rating of 2.0 mW instead of 1.0 mW.  They are probably the same laser head,
but selected based on power before printing the label. :)  Sure enough, the
waste beam from the 05-LYR-173 was only about 35 microwatts (uW) and changed
little during warmup even though the output power from this particular laser
head was about the same (4.1 mW) as the total power (front and rear) from the
sick 05-LYR-171.  In fact, the waste beam power may have even decreased
slightly as a percentage of total power as the laser warmed up.  And, the
kicker is that there were <i>multiple very obvious ghost beams</i> due to
wedge clearly visible even with only 35 uW in the waste beam!!!  Case
closed. :-) :-)

The next section includes plots of the sick yellow laser head as well as a
normal one.   More on all this including additional discussion and plots of
normal red laser heads can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrpvdl">Power Variations Due to Lack of Mirror Substrate Wedge</A>.
<p>
So in conclusion, if only the coating on the HR mirror had been incorrect
with low reflectivity at 594.1 nm, the output power of the main beam would
be reduced and the output power of the waste beam would be increased,
but they would both be stable, and the laser head would still exceed
listed specifications (1 mW minimum output power).  If the HR optic had no
wedge but its reflectivity was correct, there would probably only be minimal
output power variation because the reflected waste beam would be much lower in
power.  The laser head would also likely exceed listed specifications.
However, this "perfect storm" of manufacturing defects resulted in the
variable output power behavior and a fascinating study showing that even
small back-reflections can have a dramatic effect on HeNe laser power
stability.
<p>
It's gratifying to have been able to deduce what was going on with this laser
based on simple measurements.  Although, there might be a record of this
problem in a file somewhere at Melles Griot, it's also possible that the
head was simply put in a bin labeled "reject, variable power" and left
at that.  It must not be all that common as my contact at Melles Griot who
had worked as an engineer in the HeNe laser division for many years wasn't
able to nail it.

<h4><A NAME="htrmgyl2m">Output Power Plots of Yellow HeNe Laser Heads</A></h4>

Here are some plots of the power output of this sick laser before attempted
treatment, as well as a healthy similar model laser for comparison.
The sophisticated diagnostic instrumentation system
consists of a pair of $2 photodiodes feeding two of the analog inputs of a
<A HREF="http://www.dataq.com/194.htm">DATAQ Chart Recorder Starter
Kit</A> attached to my ancient 486DX-75 Kiwi laptop running
Win95.  Each photodiode is reverse biased by 30 VDC from a +/-15 VDC power
supply with a variable load resistor to set the calibration.  The
output is taken between the junction of the resistor and the photodiode, and
power supply common (0 VDC).  The resistor can be set so the maximum optical
power will be near +10 V to make good use of the +/-10 V range of
the A/D converters.

</PRE>
<p>
Since the input impedance of the A/D is not
infinite but about 200K ohms, and the negative power supply is -15 VDC,
the voltage for zero optical power isn't necessarily -10 V but may be
somewhat lower or higher with the calibration for this laser.  (It was
quite close though in most cases.)  This doesn't
matter for the purpose of the plots since the DATAQ display software
allows for offset and gain adjustments but would have to be factored in if
precise power measurements were important.  A simple op-amp buffer stage
could easily be added to provide proper gain and offset adjustment.
The calibration factors for all plots except the two polarized ones has been
adjusted so they would look about the same relative to actual output
power, about 4.5 mW full scale.
<p>
The capacitor across the input is intended to minimize noise pickup.  The
resulting filter rolls off at around 0.6 Hz.  For reasonably well behaved
HeNe lasers, even during the initial warmup period, this bandwidth is more
than adequate.  The sampling rate for all the plots is at least 10 Hz to allow
for averaging since the A/D seems to have an uncertainty of about 2 LSBs.
Even with lasers where external mirrors have been added (described below)
that are mounted with inadequate vibration dampening, nothing fundamental
will be missed though some of the more rapid fluctuations may be reduced
a bit in amplitude.  This would be most noticeable near the start of the
warmup period.  Where greatest accuracy was considered critical and more
rapid fluctuations were expected (as with the external mirror therapy), the
tests were done without any filtering.

cycling more visible.  The outputs from both ends of the laser head are
superimposed with equal calibration.  Note how the slow power variation
from the front and rear are out of phase but the much more rapid (normal)
variations due to mode cycling are in phase.  The peak output power for the
main beam (blue) and waste beam (red) are around 2.8 mW and 1.8 mW
respectively, near the end of the run.  I didn't bother waiting,
but from the increasing period of the variable power cycles, it's
possible that only 1 or 2 additional complete cycles would take place
before the outputs stabilized based on the balance of heat generation and
heat loss.  There is a reason that these plots have not been expanded
to fill the available height.  This will be obvious later. :)
<p>
As can be seen, for this laser, the power output from the main beam when it is
minimum and the power output from the waste beam when it is maximum are
almost the same, so this also means the that the transmission factors (1-R)
are then similar.  Based roughly on the data, we have:

<p>
The case of no etalon (wedged or perfectly AR-coated HR) was
estimated based on the equation and the data.  Note that for this low
gain laser, the total power (main and waste) is not constant, so I used
the average.
<p>
The slight shift in power balance as the laser warms up between the main and
waste beams when the main beam output power is a minimum
may be attributed to the increasing temperature of the HR mirror.
(I have virtually eliminated the obvious possible cause - differing gain and
offset for the two A/D input networks.)  The temperature rise
results in expansion of the dielectric stack causing a slight
wavelength shift in its reflectivity peak, and thus a change in the
reflectivity at 594.1 nm.  Since the HR mirror is near the
anode ballast resistor, it may see a temperature rise of 50 to 75 &deg;C.
To shift the power balance by the observed 5 to 10 percent
would not take much of a change in the HR's reflectivity.  With the peak
reflectivity already off to one side, it's on the slope of the reflectivity
function so another 0.1 nm or even less of a shift might be enough.
Assuming the temperature coefficient of a typical dielectric stack at 594.1 nm
to be one half that of the mirror substrate, for the temperature rise of
70 &deg;C used in the calculation above, the wavelength shift would actually
be about 0.2 nm.  But I picked the "one half" arbitrarily.  One Web site
showed a coefficient over 5 times greater but that was for a dielectric
filter, not a mirror, and I don't know if the same materials would be
involved and am trying to find some hard numbers on this.  But even 0.2 nm
could indeed be enough.
<p>
The next plots show what happens if a polarizing filter is placed in each of
the beams so that only one set of the (usually) orthogonal polarized modes
contribute to the output power.  <A HREF="lyr171m3.gif">Plot of Variable
Melles Griot 05-LYR-171 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup (Polarized)</A>

Melles Griot 05-LYR-171 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup (Polarized)</A>
is a closeup of only the last full cycle.  (The scale factor for these two
plots is arbitrary - the two orthogoanl polarized components must add up to the
total power in the first set of plots.)  As above, the front and rear beams
have opposite phase for the slow varying power fluctuation and the same phase
for the much more rapid mode cycling.  But note the wild fluctuations that are
often not at all similar from cycle to cycle in output power on a
short time scale, not even close to normal for a well behaved HeNe laser.
It's not clear exactly what this means but the gyrations probably include
polarization flips in addition to simply modes falling off one end of the
neon gain curve and appearing at the other end.  The back reflections from
the HR mirror's outer surface
are probably the primary cause of this instability.

output power ratings of 1.5 and 2 mW, respectively.  The model number is
probably assigned after manufacturing based on performance.   These plots
were made using the same setup.  The output power of this
laser is slightly over 4 mW after warmup.  Note the complete absence of
any slow periodic variation in output power - the trend is almost perfectly
monotonic indicating good mirror alignment and little or no wavelength shift
for the mirror coatings.  And, the polarized plot is relatively well behaved
as well with none of the rapid sudden wild random gyrations
present in the variable output power laser.  The closeup
shows that while the mode cycling power variation exhibits a complex
waveform, it repeats almost exactly from cycle-to-cycle.

<h4><A NAME="htrmgyl2e">External Mirror Therapy for Variable 05-LYR-171 yellow Laser Head</A></h4>

After completing the battery of extensive diagnostic tests, the patient
volunteered for some low risk experimental therapy to reduce the power
variations.  In an attempt to get around the problem of the improperly
manufactured HR mirror, an external mirror would be added behind it.  The
rational being that by reflecting back the wasted 594.1 nm photons into the
laser cavity, there would be the hope of increasing the power out of the
front and and reducing the power variations.  For this purpose,
an adjustable mirror mount was attached to the highly stable 1"x4" wooden
plank/V-block setup used for testing HeNe lasers, just beyond the HR-end of the
laser head.  Some of the results were unexpected, though predictable
in hindsight.  The following were tried in the order in which they appear:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Coherent, Inc. "Ultimate Broadband":</b>  The first mirror
 to be tried has at least 99.8 percent reflectivity over most or all of the
 visible spectrum.  <A HREF="lyr171m5.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot
 05-LYR-171 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup with External Broadband HR</A>
 and <A HREF="lyr171m6.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup with External Broadband HR</A>
 show the unhappy behavior.  As before, the blue plot is the
 beam from the front and the red plot is the beam from the back, this time
 through the external HR mirror.  The output from the front consisted of a
 mixture of both yellow and red (632.8 and one or two other lines nearby),
 with the power balance between the wavelengths changing erratically (not
 visible on the plot), but for the most part, the red dominated.  The peak
 output power was about 4 mW.  The power out of the rear was a very small
 amount of yellow (a few uW) with red varying from near zero to 100 or
 200 uW.  The original yellow HR must have been designed to very
 effectively kill red but not the OC.  While thought to be a logical
 initial choice, this mirror turned out to be quite poor for this
 purpose resulting in the very unstable output.  Note how the oscillations
 continue at a high amplitude throughout warmup, just fuzz on the full
 plot but are quite clearly periodic on the expanded plot.
<p>
<li><b>Yellow HR:</b> This mirror was received as an organ donation from 
 a 1 mW PMS/REO LHYR-0100 yellow laser head that probably lost a battle
 with a concrete floor.  The behavior was similar to that of the Ultimate
 Broadband, with randomly fluctuating yellow and red output from the front.
 But there was almost no leakage of either yellow or red through the
 external HR.
<p>
<li><b>Yellow OC:</b> The next mirror therapy attempt used the OC mirror
 from the same unfortunately LHYR-0100.  The behavior with
 this optic was quite different, if not that much more useful.
 <A HREF="lyr171m7.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup with External Yellow OC</A> and
 <A HREF="lyr171m8.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup with External Yellow OC)</A>
 show the results.  The output from the front was pure yellow
 with the peaks having a power of over 4 mW.  The output from the rear
 through the external OC was a few uW of yellow (relatively constant but
 too low to be measured accurately) in combination with red (Probably
 all 632.8 nm) which varied from zero to 4 mW or so.  While the peak
 yellow power out of the front is much higher than with no external
 HR mirror, the power fluctuations are also greater.  I assume that
 the major power fluctions are due to the original cause - the etalon
 formed by the 05-LYR-171's HR mirror surfaces.
<p>
<li><b>Green OC:</b> Then, on a hunch based on the observation that the
 appearance of one or both mirrors for green (543.5 nm) HeNe lasers is
 often similar to those for yellow ones, I dug out a set of mirrors removed
 from a Melles Griot 05-LGR-393 green HeNe laser.  A quick visual check showed
 that the HR mirror had high transmission for yellow and was probably designed
 to kill yellow for the green laser.  It was quite obvious that this mirror
 would be useless.  However, the OC blocked yellow very well and was installed
 with quite satisfactory results.
 See <A HREF="lyr171m9.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup with External Green OC</A> and
 <A HREF="lyr171ma.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup with External Green OC</A>.
 The power variations are still there but greatly reduced in amplitude, from
 over 40 percent to well under 20 percent.  In addition, the output power from
 the front mirror now peaks at over 4.2 mW and is always above 3.4 mW, well
 beyond even normal 05-LYR-173 territory.  The waste beam power remains less
 than 0.3 mW.  And, the outputs from both ends of the tube are pure yellow,
 594.1 nm, so there are no competing red or other wavelengths to decrease
 stability.
<p>
 Of course, as can be seen, there is an obvious penalty with this
 approach: The larger short term power fluctuations (up to 25 percent at
 3 Hz near the start of the warmup period).  To assure that the low pass
 filtering on the A/D input wasn't removing too much of the fine structure,
 this configuration was tested twice, the second time being with the data
 acquisition bandwidth increased by a factor of 50 (capacitor reduced from
 5 uF to 0.1 uF).  The raw data was also inspected to make sure there were
 no very rapid fluctuations averaged out in the display.  There were none.
 The plots above are from that high bandwidth run.
<p>
 Compare these results to the original situation shown in
 <A HREF="lyr171m1.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup</A> and
 <A HREF="lyr171m2.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup</A>.  Note that the scale
 factors on these two sets of plots have been adjusted to be the same so
 that the improvement in output power and stability will be obvious.
<p>
<li><b>Flat red HR:</b> While not expecting any miracles, since several
 mirrors for or from red HeNe lasers were available, these were
 installed just out of curiosity.  A flat red HR salvaged from a typical
 low power red HeNe laser tube resulted in a strong red beam out of the
 front with only occasional relatively low power yellow.  The waste beam
 out the back was almost totally red and quite weak.
 Just for fun, see <A HREF="lyr171mb.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot
 05-LYR-171 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup with External Flat Red HR</A>
 and <A HREF="lyr171mc.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot 05-LYR-171
 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup with External Planar Red HR</A>.
 The peak output power in the main beam and waste beam was
 about 4 mW and 300 uW, respectively.  An interesting characteristic of these
 plots is that while mostly in phase, the envelope of the waste beam slightly
 lags the envelope of the main beam.
<p>
<li><b>Flat red OC:</b>  The behavior of this mirror was similar to the
 one above, except that the waste beam power, still almost all red, was
 quite strong (3 or 4 mW).
<p>
<li><b>30 cm RoC red HR:</b> One unexpected result was that with this mirror,
 the front beam was almost totally yellow, with just an occasional bit of red
 and a peak power of over 4.1 mW.  The beam from the back was mostly yellow
 as well but with occasional red flashes and a peak power of about 0.6 mW.
 And, the stability of the main beam wasn't too terrible, actually probably
 better than with any of the previous attempts except for the one using the
 green OC.  The power did vary by up to about 40 percent but always
 stayed above 2.4 mW.  See <A HREF="lyr171md.gif">Plot of Variable Melles
 Griot 05-LYR-171 HeNe Laser Head During Warmup with External 30 cm RoC
 Red HR</A> and <A HREF="lyr171me.gif">Plot of Variable Melles Griot
 05-LYR-171 HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup with External 30 cm RoC Red
 HR</A>.  This might be explained by the fact that the 30 cm RoC mirror
 <i>doesn't</i> form a stable resonator with the front mirror of the HeNe
 laser tube, only with the back mirror.  So, it's probably acting strictly
 as an external Fabry-Perot cavity.  The waste beam profile is also quite
 complex using this mirror with a mixture of red and yellow circular
 interference fringe patterns.  Also, the scatter spot on the external HR
 for the red and yellow external intracavity beams (got that?) didn't
 coincide, suggesting that different modes were being excited for the
 two wavelengths.  I promise that these were the last boring plots for
 this laser. :)
</ul>
<p>
The circulating optical power between the internal HR and external mirror
was quite impressive with most of the mirrors, possibly as much as 0.2 WATT or
more for the Ultimate Broadband.  But it was mostly red!  If the external
surface of the 05-LYR-171's HR mirror were cleaned more carefully, the
power might go even higher but the laser would likely be even more unstable.
Nope, not going to do that.
<p>
Since I have filter capacitors resulting in a time constant of about 0.2
seconds on the two inputs to the A/Ds, a low pass filter is formed with
a 3 dB cutoff of about 5 Hz.  Higher frequency events will be reduced
in amplitude and might not show up on the plots.  However, I've examined
the raw data (the full 60 samples per second) and it appears that 5 Hz
is an adequate bandwidth to capture whatever is going on because there
is little activity anywhere near this frequency.  However, I will probably
do a test run with the capacitors removed to be sure.
<p>
Note that since the external mirror mount and laser head are not rigidly
attached to each-other, some creep between them may contribute to the
complex behavior.  No, I don't intend to perform any in-depth analyses
of any of this either!  However, this does offer a method of pushing
the power variations to higher frequencies.  Vibrating the mirror with
a loudspeaker in close proximity or a piezo transducer (e.g., a piezo
beeper from a dead digital watch!) would result in an output
power that was the average of the long term trend.  The reason is that
the short term fluctuations are caused by um-sized changes in the distance
between the external mirror and the HR mirror of the laser tube.
I did exactly this experiment by sitting a loudspeaker next to the
external mirror driven from a function generator at around 700 Hz,
which must have been close to some resonance because much less audio
power was needed to produce the desired effect.  For that same 30 cm
RoC red HR, when the output power was averaged over a time span even
as short as one sample period at 60 samples/second, most of the rapid
fluctuations disappeared.  Of course, they are still there but at a much
higher frequency.  But for some applications, that would be acceptable.
<p>
It's still possible that by using a suitably selective yellow HR mirror
or one which kills the red wavelengths more effectively, that the laser
could be even better tamed.  In the meantime, the patient has opted to learn
to live with this peculiar malady (without permanent external mirror therapy).
While the benefits of using the green OC are quite impressive, the cost is
not yet covered by HeNe laser health insurance plans.  However, that option
still exists and will be tested if a promising mirror comes along.

<h3><A NAME="htrvwbp1">Assorted Red Laser Heads With Variable Waste Beam Power</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: Several healthy barcode scanning tube volunteers.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Waste beam power varies by up to 125 percent over a
 cycle with a period that starts out short and increases in length as the
 laser warms up.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:

  <li>Output power: 1 to 1.5 mW (after 10 minute warmup).
  <li>Optimal current: 3.3 mA.

<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Patients were powered up for observation.   Starting

</ul>
<p>
For 10 or 15 years, barcode scanners used mass-produced red HeNe laser tubes
often designed for least cost.  Wedged optics are likely more expensive to
manufacture, not because of the grinding and polishing, but because
the change in thickness limits the size of the raw glass blanks that can be
used.  So, apparently, many if not most of the HeNe laser tubes destined
for barcode scanners lack wedge in their HR mirrors.
<p>
As a followup to the yellow tube studies, above, it was decided to check out
some common red tubes which exhibit similar waste beam behavior.
With proper high reflectance coatings on the HR mirror, there will be no
dramatic power variations in the main beam, but the lack of wedge will
affect the waste beam power with some small corresponding inverse variation
in main beam power..
<p>
Although these tubes are in generally excellent health, in the interests of
science, a battery of tests were performed on each to characterize their
rear-end waste beam variability.  The results are summarized below:

 The waste beam power variation has been greatly reduced.  But, the number
 of cycles has increased suggesting that the residual ripple is from
 the OC mirror which may have a larger temperature increase.  Both runs
 were under identical conditions and the number of mode cycles is about
 the same, so the overall temperature increase of the tube is about the
 same.  But the temperature increases of the HR and OC mirrors can differ
 significantly.

Both show varying degrees of waste beam variability.  The cause of

These measurements were made using the quick low cost approach using a
blow dryer to heat the HR mirror.  There was no noticeable ghost beam
for the first 4 subjects when the waste beam was projected on a white
card at any distance from the HR.  The next subject had just
detectable fuzz off to ne side a few feet from the HR, with visible
ghost beams at increasing angles for the final 3 subjects.  With any
sort of decent wedge, the variation of waste beam power due to HR
subtrate etalon effects - if it exists at all - is swamped by the
normal mode sweep and thus cannot be determined reliably.  So, only
the average waste beam power is given for them.  The more extensive
time consuming and expensive total warmup test will be required to
obtain min, max, and ratio values.
<p>
However, the residual waste beam power variation for tubes with HR wedge
(including the last Siemens LGR-7641 run) are
likely due to etalon effects in the OC mirror!  A blob of 5 minute Epoxy
on the 05-LHR-006 tube's HR made essentially no change in the amplitude of
the ripples.  Had it been reflections from the wedged surface, they should
have gotten smaller.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrpvdl">Power Variations Due to Lack of Mirror
Substrate Wedge</A>.
<p>
Conclusions: The only obvious manifestation of the rather dramatic rear-end
variability are some slight ripples in the main beam corresponding to the
power stolen by the waste beam.  For these red tubes, it's a very small
percentage and well within their acceptable specifications.  No treatment
is required unless any of these tubes are to be used in an application
where power stability of the waste beam is critical.  But such adventures would
be strongly discouraged since a perfect remedy is likely impossible, or at
least very expensive and time consuming, and definitely not covered by any
laser tube health insurance plan.

<h3><A NAME="htrmg640">Case Study of 145 Melles Griot 05-LHR-640 HeNe Laser Tubes</A></h3>

This work was underwritten by the International Society of HeNe Health
(ISHH). :)
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: An assortment of used 05-LHR-640 HeNe laser tubes.
 These were all removed from the same type of equipment for reasons
 unknown, but generally not due to tube failure.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: NA
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.5 to 1.4 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: 4.5 mA.
  <li>Beam quality: Excellent.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> A quick sort was performed to identify the
 real losers.  Several tubes were DOA.  The mirrors were salvaged from those
 that were smashed, except for one we won't talk about. ;-)  One other tube
 appears to have never been used but had bad gas and was preserved as a
 show-and-tell unit.
</ul>
<p>
These 145 Melles Griot HeNe laser tubes were all volunteers.  The standard
05-LHR-640 has a rated output power of 0.5 mW and are very small - about 5
inches in length by 1 inch in diameter.  They look like normal Melles Griot
tubes with the glass bell at the anode-end, not the barcode variety with the
metal end-cap (though Melles Griot still calls them barcode scanning tubes).
And the beam exits from the cathode-end like most normal tubes.  This
batch are all OEM tubes, from some sort of scanner based measurement
system.
<p>
Six of the 145 tubes didn't survive travel, another one had a gas-fill
problem, and the records for two more were lost somehow and didn't make it
into my statistics. :)  So, there are only 136 entries for working tubes.
<p>
Functional testing was done using a Melles Griot 05-LPM-379 power supply set
at 4.5 mA using my HeNe laser diagnostic unit.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrmb">Ballast Resistor Selector and Meter Box</A>.)
The ballast resistance was set at 54K.  (For some reason, possibly due to
the long wire lead to the tube anode, 54K was more stable
for tubes with a higher operating voltage than the next choice of 81K.)
Both tube voltage and tube current were monitored continuously.  Output
power was also measured continuously using a laser power meter with the
listed value being approximately 0.05 mW <i>lower</i> then the peak
(from mode cycling) after 5 to 10 minutes with the precision only maintained
to the nearest 0.05 mW.  If anything, some of these output power values
may be lower than after complete warmup since the output power had not
necessarily stopped increasing in the time allotted by the ISHH for each test.
During this time, mirror alignment was checked by gentle sideways pressure
on the cathode-end mirror mount and if a noticeable increase was detected,
the mirror alignment was optimized for peak power.  About half the
tubes benefited from this treatment (free of charge), many quite
significantly.
<p>
Interestingly, the output power when new for these (and other very small)
tubes may be nearly 3 times the 0.5 mW spec'd value!  Even the sickest of
the tubes that survived would still meet output power specifications.
<p>
The chart below is sorted by tube operating voltage.  The spec'd voltage for
the 05-LHR-640 is 880 V but none of the tested tubes came anywhere close, with
even the best of them that looked and acted brand new were almost 40 V higher.
While it's possible my measurements are off somewhat, I don't think it is
more than a few volts either way since I've double and triple checked
the calibration.  I have also tested some Melles Griot laser heads that
I know have seen little use and the voltage for those was within 1 percent
of the listed values.  So, possibly the voltage specs I have for the
05-LHR-640 are incorrect, or even with modest use, the voltage climbs
considerably.  However, these are actually OEM laser tubes,
manufactured for a specific application.  So, perhaps the
operating voltage spec for them is slightly different than the standard
tube.
<p>
Even though the voltage readings in comparison to 880 V may not
be significant, the relative voltages should be
consistent.  As can be seen, the highest output power on average
is not surprisingly associated with the lowest tube voltage.  As the
voltage increases - which is how these tubes change with use - the output
power on average declines somewhat, but not dramatically.  Also on average,
increasing amounts of the dreaded brown crud appear in the bore for tubes
exhibiting a higher operating voltage, with zebra stripe striations indicating
plasma oscillation for many of them.

The chart is divided into groups in ascending operating voltage, which likely
translates roughly into hours of use.  Group 1 has tubes I consider
to be in essentially new condition with low operating voltage and very little
or no brown crud in the bore.  As can be seen, on average, they also have the
highest output power, over twice the 0.5 mW rating.  Tubes in Group 2
are definitely quite healthy but have seen some use.  Their operating
voltage is somewhat higher and there is usually some brown crud in the
bore.  But their output power still averages nearly double the rated
value.  Most of the tubes in Group 3 have substantial brown crud in
their bores but are still usable, even those marked with a "*", which
were hard to keep running and would start flashing after a couple minutes
using my test setup, which has a rather long run from the final ballast
resistor and the tube anode.  However, when operated with the ballast close
to the anode, they were stable.  The output power of virtually all of
these are still well above 0.5 mW.  Out of 137 intact tubes, only one
didn't work at all (not listed) due to a bad gas fill.  It wasn't
end-of-life as the bore was in pristine condition and the operating
voltage was quite low (851 V, dropping as the tube warmed up).
The tube was either leaky or had not been processed properly when
manufactured with the discharge color being excessively pink with
reduced brightness.
<p>
Here are the stats for all working tubes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 averages (40 tubes): 939 V, 1.132 mW.
<li>Group 2 averages (67 tubes): 975 V, 0.832 mW.
<li>Group 3 averages (29 tubes): 1,000 V, 0.672 mW.
<li>Overall averages (136 tubes): 970 V, 0.884 mW.
</ul>
<p>
Finally, I used MS Excel to generate a plot of these data and trends.  See
<A HREF="lhr640s1.gif">Melles Griot 05-LHR-640 HeNe laser Tube Health</A>.

Many of these tubes are available for low cost adoption.  Please see:

<h3><A NAME="htr3184h">Some Hughes 3184H Semi-Antique HeNe Laser Heads</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: Eighteen very old and bedraggled Hughes 3184H HeNe
 laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: No power to reasonably healthy
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0 to 2.4 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: 6.5 mA.
  <li>Beam quality: Excellent, once the grime from the decayed foam was
   cleaned off.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Each laser head was powered using my
 HeNe laser diagnostic unit.  Those that either lased (even if weakly)
 or at least had an operating voltage somewhat close to normal (around
 1,600 V) were set aside for additional testing and adjustment.
</ul>
<p>
The Hughes 3184H is a really old HeNe laser head which consists of a
two-Brewster HeNe laser tube inside a gold-colored cylinder with mirrors
in the semi=adjustable end-places as shown in
<A HREF="hu3184-1.jpg">Hughes Model 3184H HeNe Laser Head</A>
and <A HREF="hu3184h1.gif">Hughes Model 3184H HeNe Laser Head Construction</A>.
<p>
These had apparently been stored in a damp, if not absolutely wet basement
for around 30 years.  The test dates written on some of the laser heads
are from 1973!  As described in the
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henish8">The Ancient Hughes HeNe Laser Head</A>,
these laser heads actually consist of two-Brewster HeNe laser tube inside
a massive gold-colored aluminum cylinder, with somewhat adjustable end-plates
which contain the mirrors.
<p>
I had tested two 3184H laser heads in the past that were actually
newer than this batch (1976 and 1979) but neither lased.  However, when these
eighteen were originally tested by someone else, 4 were found to be in at
least somewhat working condition.  I was happy to trade a bunch of mostly
non-laser electronics items for these laser heads, mainly for the 2-B tubes
inside.
<p>
I've now tested all 18 and found that 4 of them lased without doing anything
and 3 others run at an operating voltage close to that of the ones that
work - about 1,600 V across the red and green wires (at 6 mA) - but produced
no beam.  All of the rest started, but have an operating voltage at least 200 V
higher and show the tell-tail reddish discharge color indicating air leakage.
All of the bad ones have serial (ID) numbers below 1000 and are not listed.
With a bit of mirror tweaking - quite a bit for most - and in some cases
B-window cleaning, all the heads with the more or less correct operating
voltage now lase, with those outputting at or above 3.00 mW being
within measurement error of their power back in 1973.  I believe that with
careful cleaning and alignment, they would further improve.
<p>
All are listed below:
<p>

  &lt;900   0.0 mW   >1,800 V   None of these 10 even come close to lasing.
  1014   2.6 mW    1,614 V
  1015   0.5 mW    1,585 V   Started out very weak, more below.
   ""    1.8 mW    1,593 V   Peaks, then declines.
  1038   3.5 mW    1,610 V
  1040   3.1 mW    1,629 V   Produces 4.1 mW on test rail, see next section.
  1042   2.5 mW    1,616 V
  1043   3.0 mW    1,614 V
  1050   3.2 mW    1,682 V
  1075   2.0 mW    1,602 V   Produces 3.8 mW on test rail, see next section.
  3506   0.0 mW    1,720 V   Newer (1976) has pink/red discharge color.
  4197   0.0 mW      --      Newest (1979) is nearly up to air.
</PRE>
<p>
The low operating voltage of ID# 1015 suggests gas contamination.  In support
of this, besides the low output power, is the behavior of output power with
warmup: first the output power increases to as much as 1.8 mW and then declines
over the course of a few minutes.  This is repeatable but the peak and
minimum output power, as well as the operating voltage, has so far been
steadily increasing so there may be hope yet.  The first entry is the initial
behavior after warmup, prior to cleaning and alignment.  The second entry
shows the peak power and highest operating voltage after cleaning and
alignment, and a few power/warmup cycles.  A portion of the power
difference (but none of the voltage difference) is due to the cleaning and
alignment but most is probably a result of gas cleanup.  Hopefully, after
awhile it will increase to a respectable output power and be stable there.
Presently, it starts out somewhat low, peaks, then declines to about 1 mW.
The operating voltage also declines to below 1,575 V when it is hot.
<p>
The other laser head with a somewhat low operating voltage, ID# 1075, may
also benefit from similar treatment, but probably not as dramatically.
<p>
The second from lsat is one of the laser heads I acquired a year or two ago.
It's from 1976 and lights up but won't lase.  The discharge color is now
pink-red thought I think it may have been more correct before (but it never
lased).
<p>
The last one is the other one I've had for awhile.  It used to have a weak
discharge color and incorrect operating voltage, but now only pulses weakly
and won't start.
<p>
<b>Followup:</b>
<p>
All the Hughes 3184H laser heads that were not totally dead were asked
to return for followup tests to determine how their condition has
progressed after about six months.  They are compared in the chart below.

<p>
(NLA: No Longer Available, moved to a different location.)
<p>
It would appear the heads that produced near spec'd power originally are
essentially unchanged after 6 months, but the ones that were marginal to
begin with have declined significantly.  Power cycling therapy is being
performed free of charge on them but they probably won't come back completely.
The slight decline of ID#s 1038, 1050, and 1075 is probably not statistically
significant since the current was not optimized for maximum power and only
limited time was allocated for each test.
<p>
In particular, ID# 1015 would only produce momentary flashes when first
powered up. Suspecting alignment or contamination (since it has been
opened), the mirrors were removed and it was placed on test rail.  It
required some running time and a few power cycles to get back to even
the 0.4 mW.

<h4><A NAME="htr3184ht">Hughes 3184H HeNe Laser Plasma Tube Test Rail</A></h4>

I have now constructed a setup which has a sturdy mount for the laser head,
initially had a pair of adjustable Parker-Daedal 1 inch mounts (similar to
a Newport MM-1 but not quite as precise) for the mirrors.
<p>
This enables the health of the actual tube to be assessed as
well as permitting the B-windows to be more conveniently cleaned.
Version 1.0 is shown in <A HREF="hu3184t1.jpg">Photo of Hughes
Model 3184H HeNe Laser Plasma Tube Test Rail - V1.0</A> and
<A HREF="hu3184t2.jpg">Closeup of OC-End of Hughes 3184H Test Rail</A>.
Do you know what the two spots visible inside the cylinder are?
<p>
To minimize dust collection on the Brewster windows, the laser head should
be oriented either with the Hughes label on the side (which puts the B-windows
vertical) or on top (which puts the B-window facing down).  Even so, cleaning
of the B-windows will be needed periodically to peak power.  This can make
a huge difference, especially if a clump of dust decides to settle in a
bad place - and dust tends to be attracted to the high intracavity beam.
As long as there is lasing, anything on the B-windows will be obvious.
<p>
Note that the 3184H laser head is not symmetric.  In fact, it appears that
the bore is significantly wider at the OC-end compared to the HR-end to
more closely match the mode volume of the hemispherical resonator (flat
HR and 30 cm RoC OC, spaced just under 30 cm apart) and it's much wider
overall than would be required for the beam diameter.  As confirmation,
the spot on the HR (in the original laser) is very small, almost a single
point.  Thus, interchanging the OC and HR without also changing their RoCs
will result in mediocre performance.  So, something along the lines of a
hemispherical arrangement really is the one that should be used, though
it's possible that a long radius hemispherical resonator might be even
better.
<p>
After realizing that a symmetric configuration with a pair of 60 cm mirrors
was far from optimal (due to the tapered bore), I switched to using
a flat HR and a 60 cm OC (from an SP-084, 99%R at 633 nm).
These result in decent output power (see below) but produce
a beautiful doughnut (non-TEM00) beam profile.  The original hemispherical
configuration would force a TEM00 beam even with the relatively
wide (but tapered) bore.  Eventually, I may try to
optimize the mirror RoCs for a TEM00 beam, but that would be so boring. :)
I can't use the OC mirror from a 3184H laser head because its 30 cm RoC is
too short for the extended length cavity.  A 40 cm RoC OC might be acceptable
though.
<p>
The easiest way to perform mirror alignment on this sort of
setup is to *never* lose the alignment of *both* mirrors at the same time!
Otherwise, an alignment laser will probably be needed, though I have been
successful in restoring lasing on an intact 3184H laser head by careful
trial and error, simply using the mechanical alignment of the end-plate
with respect to the head cylinder as a guide.  Though, maybe it was more
a matter of luck.
<p>
So, start with a 3184H that is lasing.  Secure it in the mounts and adjust
the external mirror beyond the OC so that all the reflected spots converge.
Then remove the 3184H's OC.  The alignment should be close enough so that
when the end-plate is removed, if it isn't already lasing, slight rocking
of the mirror in Y while very slowly adjusting the alignment in X will
restore a lasing condition.  Unfortunately, the same procedure can't be used
with the HR because of its fine-ground outer surface.  For that one
(as well as the OC should its alignment be lost later on), I use a 60 cm
RoC HR or OC mirror mounted in a mirror cell such as shown in
<A HREF="mircel1.gif">Simple Mounting Cell for Salvaged HeNe Laser Tube
Mirrors</A>, or any other similar mounting scheme.  This can simply be held
against the end of the 3184H cylinder and easily adjusted by hand until the
tube lases (assuming the other end is aligned).  Then, the adjustable mirror
can be tweaked until the spots converge as above.  Once the 2-B tube has been
tested, the Hughes end-plates can be reinstalled.  The OC can use its outer
surface reflection as a guide but the HR will simply have to be carefully
adjusted until flashes occur.  Buts as long as alignment of both ends is
not lost, all of these procedures are really quite quick and easy.
<p>
In preliminary tests, head ID# 1075 that was only doing 2 mW with its mirrors
produces over 3.5 mW on this rig.  I'm not sure how much of the improvement
is due to being able to clean the Brewster windows very well and how much is
due to the different mirror RoCs, more modern mirrors, or cleaner mirrors.
<p>
I have since replaced the original mirror mounts with some Newport mounts
(U50-A) to improve the precision and repeatability.  While the Parker-Daedal
mounts are perfectly acceptable for beam steering, their behavior inside a
laser cavity left something to be desired.  The U50-A has about 3 times the
resolution with their 100 tpi screws, and less interaction between X and Y.
I "machined" a pair of 1/2 inch to 8 mm adapter rings for the typical HeNe
laser mirrors that would be used most often.
For Version 2.0, I've also added some aluminum plates under the
rail to add some stiffness, as even gently touching the mounts resulted in
major fluctuations in output power.  A sturdier resonator frame with a pair
of my home-built mirror mounts would probably be even more stable but this
was quick and easy. :)  While probably unrelated to these changes, the output
power of head ID# 1075 is now up to 3.8 mW.
<p>
Of course, as with any external mirror laser, keeping the Brewster windows
and mirrors clean is a challenge.  They are oriented vertically in this
setup and the mirrors stay fairly clean.  But the Brewster windows tend to
collect all sorts of stuff (technical term!) even after a short period of
time.  Only occasionally do I clean the mirrors, and then only using the
drop-and-drag method with lens tissue and pure isopropyl alcohol.  I usually
just use new cotton swabs to gently dust off the Brewster windows, with the
scatter as a guide to cleanliness.  When the scatter from the outer surface
is less than the scatter from the inner surface, that's the indication that
they are about as clean as possible.
<p>
Next, I installed head ID# 1040 in place of head ID# 1075 on the test
rail.  It was fairly close to optimal alignment after just dropping the tube
in in place and tightening the clamps.  Then, some mirror walking to peak
output power.  While originally doing 3.1 mW, it now produces up to about
4.1 mW.  So, a bit livelier but probably within the normal manufacturing
variation from head to head, and not due to a problem with head ID# 1075.
I'd expect the remaining working heads to behave similarly.
<p>
After this, I had to try a Coherent, Inc. mirror called an "Ultimate
Broadband".  This mirror does indeed appear to be highly reflective through
the entire visible spectrum.  Being 1/2 inch in diameter, it fit right into
the Newport U50-A mirror mounts.  Indeed, the super mirror performed even
better than my original HeNe HR.  The output power peaked at about 4.5 mW
after initial alignment, though I couldn't get more than about 4.3 mW
consistently (probably due to my lack of ability to keep the four exposed
optical surfaces clean in my optics/laser lab, err, basement!).  I don't really
know how much of the power increase, if any, was due to higher reflectivity
of the super mirror, and how much might have been due to its RoC of 1
meter, compared to flat for the original HR.
<p>
I later installed a pair of Ultimate Broadband mirrors in hopes of getting
something other than boring 632.8 nm (red).  But although lasing was strong
and stable inside the cavity, there was no evidence of any other wavelengths
in the output beams which were weak as expected - these are HR mirrors after
all!  I also installed the mirror set from a defunct PMS/REO
LHYR-0100 yellow HeNe laser tube but also as expected, could not get anything
at all probably due to the losses through the Brewster windows, not present
in the original internal mirror tube.

<h3><A NAME="htr3176h">Hughes 3176H HeNe Laser Head with 3509H Power Supply
 with Low Output</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: Senior Hughes 3176 HeNe laser head and mating 3509H
 power supply in near-mint physical condition.  These dat to 1977.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Weak but stable.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: peaks at 1.6 mW, then declines to 1.3 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: Excellent.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> At first, the laser was dead but since I know it
 had been tested and did work, and was well packed so shipping damage was
 unlikely, I took the cover off the power supply.  The CDRH delay was
 implemented using a thermal relay in a glass tube, and it had worked loose
 from the socket despite the RTV used to seal it in place.  Once that was
 cleared up, the laser started quickly and ran reliably.  The current is
 somewhat high - 6.8 mA - but for now, that is a secondary issue.
</ul>
<p>
The Hughes 3176H appears to be the successor to the 3184H despite its lower
model number.  The case is identical in every respect except that instead of
flying leads, it has a normal coax with Alden connector, but still coming
out the side.  There is also an additional plate on the output end of the
laser head with a beam shutter (but that would fit the 3184H as well).
The tube has changed slightly though.  The HR-end is the same glass stem
and glued or optically contacted Brewster window.  But the OC-end has
an angled metal stem with a glued Brewster window.
<p>
(There was also a 3178H which is only 8-3/8 inches long, so 1 to 2 mW but
otherwise similar to the 3176H with the Alden cable coming out the side.
The one I have seems healthy, and after aligning the front mirror,
it outputs 0.94 mW at 5 mA and 1.0 mW at 6.5 mA.  A more careful alignment
of both mirrors may boost it some more.
Even though the laser head has a standard Alden connector, its ballast
resistance is too low to run on a conventional power supply.
I assume the internal construction is the same.)
<p>
Before surgery, the laser was tested for output power behavior.  In addition,
the mirror mount adjustments were carefully tweaked and found to be near
optimal.
<p>
Next, the laser head was installed on the test rail described in the previous
section and the front mirror was removed and the external OC was fine tuned.
Peak power increased to 1.9 or 2.0
mW, though the original mirror appeared to be spotless.  Despite some scatter
on the Brewster window, cleaning that didn't help very much.  In fact, there
appears to be some scatter on both the inside and outside surfaces.  Despite
repeated cleaning with alcohol, the minimum scatter on the outside can never
be reduced to the level that is generally present, and no where as low as
for my good 3184H.  Removing the rear mirror, cleaning the Brewster
window, and fine tuning the external HR made little difference.  The
scatter off the HR Brewster window is also excessive.  Walking the
mirrors also didn't help much.
<p>
So, with optimal conditions on the test rail, maximum power is about 2.1 mW
but that isn't sustainable and it goes down to 1.8 or 1.9 mW after fully
warming up.  Replacing the head's mirrors - first the HR and then the OC,
resulted in a drop of output to close to the pre-surgery levels.  The HR
had little effect - the OC caused the most reduction in power.  I tried an
OC from a 3184H but that was no better.  The power reduction may be
attributable to the slight difference in resonator geometry between the
external mirrors and head mirrors.  The external mirrors are set up to
be marginally TEM00.  In fact, optimal output power occurs with a slight
doughnut beam (TEM01*).  The Hughes laser would have been designed for
TEM00, which can result in a slight loss of power.  So, it was probably
very near optimal in terms of cleaning and alignment even after almost
30 years.  Quite amazing.
<p>
The tube is definitely tired.  I can drop my good one onto the rail and
get 4.3 mW without trying too hard.  Whether it's related to the scatter
on the B-windows or just abused gas I don't know.
<p>
The output power increases with increasing current beyond where it's
running, but that could be a gas problems or just suboptimal resonator
due to the scatter.
<p>
Finally, the power supply was adjusted to 6.5 mA after the well hidden
pot was found recessed inside the side of the potted HV module against
the sheet metal divider inside the power supply.  I'm not sure that 6.5 mA
is correct - perhaps the 6.8 mA was set to achieve rated power at the
factory!  But, 6.5 mA should be a less stressful amount of current for
an gracefully aging laser! :)
<p>
Conclusions: The patient has been asked to return monthly for followup
output power tests to keep track of its health trends.  If the output power
remains about the same, then the long term prognosis is good.  However, if
there is an obvious rapid decline over the course of several months, this
may be bad news with no cure.  No further surgery is anticipated.

<h3><A NAME="htrsp117s">Transplant Surgery for Two Sick Spectra-Physics Model
 117 Stabilized HeNe Laser Heads</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: Two older SP-117 laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: One would lase but not lock, the other would not
 lase.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0 to 3.2 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: Unknown.
  <li>Beam quality: Fine for lasing patient, 0.0 mW for the other.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Both laser heads were powered using mating
 SP-117 controller.  Neither worked properly.
</ul>
<p>
The SP-117 is a stabilized HeNe laser which produces a single
longitudinal mode output with a nominal frequency of 473.61254 THz
stabilized in frequency to a slope of the HeNe gain curve.  More
information on this and the SP-117A (its successor) may be found
at: <A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp117">Description of the SP-117A
Stabilized Single Frequency HeNe Laser</A>.
<p>
I acquired an SP-117 laser head, and separately, an SP-117 controller and
second laser head (shown in <A HREF="sp117s1.jpg">Spectra-Physics
Model 117 Stabilized HeNe Laser System</A>).
This controller is in pristine condition but quite old, with IC dates codes
of 1983 or earlier.  I assume the laser head that came with it is of
similar vintage.  My other SP-117 laser head is dated 1985 and is also
in pristine condition, or so I thought. :)
<p>
Unfortunately, the laser tube in the laser head that came with the controller
was dead (its organs shown in
<A HREF="sp117h1.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model 117 Stabilized HeNe Laser Head
Components</A>.  The tube starts, but the discharge was that
sickly white-ish color indicating end-of-life.  The tube
in my other laser head works fine.  However, the controller would
not stabilize using it - the output power kept fluctuating in the normal way
it does when any vanilla-flavored HeNe laser is warming up, but the Stabilized
indicator came on almost immediately, meaning the detection circuitry for the
Stabilized indicator wasn't seeing any changes in the voltage level.  Poking
around inside the SP-117 controller, I found a couple of test points that
seemed to be the two sampled signals.  One was bouncing up and down but the
other one wasn't moving.
<p>
As a test, I took the sensor assembly from the head with the dead
tube and plugged it into the controller.  Shining a laser pointer on each
of the photodiodes evoked a nice strong response from the associated test
point so it seemed like there was either something wrong with one photodiode
in the head that lased, or some internal adjustment wasn't set correctly.
for the sensitivity of the photodiode channel that wasn't working.  Since
I have no idea of what the adjustment pots do (there are 3 of them, unmarked
with any function information), I simply swapped the photodiode assembly from
the dead head into the one that lases.  It's just two screws and a connector,
with no alignment required.
<p>
This resulted in the laser now behaving much better.  The voltage on the test
points oscillated from about 6 to 8 V during the warmup mode sweep, and after
about 18 minutes, the Stabilized indicator started flashing.  In another
couple minutes, it came on solid for awhile.  But some fine tuning of the
internal adjustments must be required, because one of the photodiode channels
could be seen slowly varying up and down by a few tenths of a volt, and
occasionally, the Stabilized Indicator would flash for a few seconds.
There was never a mode hop, but the laser's frequency was changing by
more than an acceptable amount on the slope of the gain curve.  Around
20 minutes later, it finally settled down.
<p>
There is also somewhat of a mystery in that all tests of the supposedly
defective photodiode found no problems initially, more on this below.
Perhaps whatever is/was wrong with the photodiode is what caused this
laser head to be taken out of service before it was run into the ground -
these stabilized lasers typically being left on continuously for years to
avoid the annoying warmup delay. :)
<p>
I found a healthy 088-2 (greater than 2.8 mW. in my HeNe laser tube collection
and have now installed it in place of the dead tube.  The axes of the
modes of the 088-2 were determined using a polarizer - one of them happened to
line up with the exhaust tip-off, so keeping track of that was easy.
There were two initial concerns:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The number of modes that oscillate for this tube.  Since it's physically
 identical to the dead tube, I doubt this is an issue.  The longitudinal
 mode spacing is about 640 MHz so it would be theoretically possible for
 3 modes to fit in the approximately 1.5 GHz doppler broadened gain curve.
 However, when stabilized, one of the modes will be locked on a slope of
 the gain, offset from the center.  The second mode would be somewhere on
 the other slope and this would make it virtually impossible for any
 additional modes to see enough gain to oscillate.  So, during warmup,
 there might be three modes at times but when stabilized, this is unlikely.
<p>
<li>The waste beam from the HR mirror is intense enough to generate a
 satisfactory signal for the controller.  Without pulling apart the
 working laser head, there is no way to tell the output power of the
 waste beam.  However, again, being physically identical to the dead
 tube, it is unlikely SP would have made too many changes - if any -
 specifically for the SP-117 laser.  And, it is still an HR mirror
 with no AR coating, so that's some confirmation.
</ol>
<p>
The only damage during disassembly was to the RTV silicone blobs holding
the original tube in place which will need to be replaced somehow someday,
and the loss of 1 or 2 wraps of the aluminum
foil, but I doubt that matters as there are 8 or 10 more.
<p>
Reassembly for testing was straightforward.  At first, this head had the
same photodiode problem as discussed above, but unplugging and replugging
the photodiode connector to the photodiodes cured that - at least
temporarily.  Then, it appeared as though the signal
level was very low (concern number 1), but that turned out to be caused by
misalignment of the tube with the very small hole in the beamsplitter
assembly due to lack of a stable mounting arrangement.  Once carefully
positioned, the signal level was nearly as strong as with the good SP-117
laser head, and indeed after the normal delay, the Stabilized indicator
came on, twitched a couple times, and then settled down.  So, there seems
to be no problem stabilizing after the transplant.  In fact, this laser
head has a larger voltage swing for the photodiode signals (about 2 to 6 V,
though that perhaps be fixed by an adjustment in the controller) and
might even be more stable than the other one.  Some adjustment of the
controller is probably in order eventually, but the hospital staff does
not currently have the necessary skills.  A cable to the photodiode
channel test points was added so they could be monitored without having
the controller open.
<p>
However, there was one final glitch.  After mounting the tube somewhat more
permanently - with several layers of electrical tape and putting everything
back together, the photodiode problem reappeared.  In fact, it seems that
whenever power was cycled, the connector would have to be removed and replaced
to get it out of some latch-up state.  In that state, the output is actually
negative - opposite of normal.  On a hunch, since the connector can
be installed in either of two positions oriented 180 degrees from each-other
and effectively swapping the two photodiodes, I reinstalled it the other way.
And, lo and behold, it now appears to always power up properly.  There is no
good reason why this should have worked, so the mystery remains.  Whether
it's something funny about the photodiode or some problem in the controller
is not known either.  But for now, the system is operational.  Since the
polarization orientation of the tube was selected arbitrarily, swapping
the photodiode in this manner has no more real effect on behavior that matters.
<p>
The entire detailed tube replacement procedure is provided in the next section.
<p>
Conclusions: Both patients appear to be doing well.  The controller may need
some adjustments so periodic checkups will be performed.  Overall though, the
surgery would appear to be a success.

<h4><A NAME="htrsp117r">SP-117 HeNe Laser Tube Replacement Procedure</A></h4>

The following assumes the use of a similar SP-088-2 HeNe laser tube, but
any tube of similar length and output power with cathode-end output should
work, assuming it can be stuffed in somehow.
<p>
It is best to take a photo at each step for reference.  While the position
and orientation of most of the parts is obvious, there are some where a photo
might be helpful.  See <A HREF="sp117h1.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model 117
Stabilized HeNe Laser Head Components</A>, though it may differ from yours
in the details.
<p>
<b>Disassembly:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove three sets of 4 setscrews each to free the internal laser
 assembly from the aluminum head cylinder.  The setscrews are at the cable-end,
 a few inches from the cable-end, and a few inches from the output-end.  The
 later two sets may be concealed under some adhesive strips.  The
 output bezel does not need to be removed.  It is best to completely
 remove the setscrews because they need to be turned out so far that
 some will likely fall out on their own and disappear to where all those
 missing socks are hiding. :)
<p>
<li>Mark the orientation and then remove the output polarizer (if present)
 by loosening the single setscrew and pulling it free.  This step isn't
 essential but will minimize the chance of damage to it and allow easier
 access to the end of the tube.
<p>
<li>Remove four screws holding the black output optics assembly in place,
 pull it free, and set it aside.  Unclip the cathode wire from the tube.
 (Note that there may be two different lengths of flat-head 4-40 screws.
 The shorter ones secure the aluminum tube frame.)
<p>
<li>Cut the cable ties and unplug the connectors for the heater
 (typically red/red/orange or just red/red wires) and cathode return
 (green wire).  Make a note of the connector positions if not obvious.
<p>
<li>Remove four screws holding the tube assembly to the black beam sampler
 assembly, pull the tube assembly free, and unclip the anode wire.
<p>
<li>Make a note of how the heater shroud is oriented relative to the tube
 assembly.
<p>
<li>Use a thin strip of metal to slice through the 8 blobs of RTV silicone
 holding the tube in place as close to the tube surface as possible.  This
 should permit the tube, along with the heater shroud, to slide out of the
 cylindrical aluminum frame leaving the RTV in place.  If this is done
 carefully, the existing RTV blobs will both center the new tube and hold it
 snug enough for alignment.
<p>
<li>Peel the heater from the tube.  Take special care not to damage the
 printed heater traces.
<p>
<li>If the replacement tube doesn't have an aluminum foil wrap, it will need
 to be removed from the old tube, or replaced with enough kitchen foil to build
 up to about the same thickness.  It may be possible to peel the old wrap free
 but it is easier to use a sharp blade to slice through just the first 1 or 2
 layers since these are glued in place and very difficult to peel off.  The
 loss of those layers won't matter.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Replacement tube preparation:</b>
<p>
<ol start=10>
<li>Power up the replacement tube on a separate HeNe laser power supply or
 the one in the SP-117 controller (the control connector will have to be
 plugged into the SP-117 controller to complete the interlock circuit).
<p>
<li>As it is warming up, monitor the output through a polarizer to determine
 the orientation that results in the maximum fluctuation of power due to mode
 cycling.
<p>
<li>Mark this orientation on the tube to use during reassembly.  Power down
 and disconnect the power supply.  Discharge the residual capacitance!!! :)
<p>
<li>Install the aluminum foil wrap (if not present) approximately centering
 it and making sure the foil is at least 1/2 inch from the anode end-cap.
 It should be smooth and tight and secured in place with thin tape.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Reassembly:</b>
<p>
<ol start=14>
<li>Install the heater shroud so that the red wires line up with one of the
 polarization axes of the tube.  If there was an orange wire stuffed under
 the outer wrap, replace it.  I have no idea of its purpose, and it is
 completely lacking in some SP-117 laser heads and all SP-117A laser heads
 as far as I can tell.  Use some clear tape to secure the heater shroud in
 place if needed.
<p>
<li>Install the tube/heater in its aluminum cylinder, along with the green
 cathode wire routed through to the output end of the tube and clip it in
 place.  If the original RTV is present, the tube assembly will likely be
 approximately centered and snug enough to stay in place until being
 secured permanently with additional RTV.
<p>
<li>Reinstall the black output optics holder.
<p>
<li>After attaching the anode clip, reinstall the tube assembly into the
 beam sampler taking care that the anode wire doesn't block the hole to
 the beam sampler.  Make sure the wiring channels line up.  Reattach the
 connectors for the heater (red wires) and cathode (green wire).  Take
 care that the green wires line up in the two halves of the connector!
<p>
<li>If the original RTV could not be saved, use whatever is handy to center
 the tube temporarily to confirm correct operation.  Wads of electrical tape
 and bicycle inner tubes work. :)  If the original RTV blobs are present,
 then at most, some thin plastic shims will serve to secure it temperorarily
 and center the tube.
<p>
<li>Remove the photodiode bracket. Power up the laser and confirm that the
 waste beams both are fairly well centered in the direct and right-angle
 apertures.  Adjust the centering if necessary.  Replace the photodiode
 bracket making sure the grounding strap is in its original position to
 press against the cylinder cover when it is replaced.
<p>
<li>Allow the laser to warm up while monitoring the photodiode test points
 inside the SP-117 controller.  (I don't recall what they are on the
 SP-117, but on the SP-117A, these are TP3 and TP6.)  They are
 at the corner of the PCB near the center of the case.  The two channels
 should be roughly equal in minimum and maximum excursion.  This typically
 ranges between 2 or 3 V and 6 or 7 V.  The exact voltages aren't critical
 but they should be set to be about equal.
 Fine tune the orientation of the tube to maximize the voltage
 swings.  If the behavior of the two channels differs greatly or one is
 missing, double check the tube centering and that none of the photodiode
 wires have broken off.  Note: Prevent ambient light from reaching the
 photodiodes as this will affect their behavior.
<p>
<li>Install the laser tube assembly into the head cylinder.  This is
 necessary to prevent ambient light from reaching the photodiodes and
 to provide the correct thermal environment for the laser to stabilize.
<p>
<li>The laser should stabilize after the usual 15 to 20 minute warmup
 (less if the tube had been run for awhile and is still warm) with
 minimal flashing of the Stabilized indicator.  The two test points should
 be approximately equal after stabilization with minimal hunting or drift.
<p>
<li>Assuming this is satisfactory, use some RTV silicone to secure the tube
 permanently (8 locations).  Only use a small amount of RTV so that the
 blobs are similar in size to what was there originally.  DO NOT use a
 rigid adhesive as the tube needs to be able to expand freely.  DO NOT
 use hot-melt glue as the tube gets hot enough during normal operation
 to soften it!
<p>
<li>Reinstall the output polarizer (if originally present) initially
 orienting it based on your alignment mark.  If having pure polarization
 is critical, it will have to be fine tuned using a scanning Fabry-Perot
 interferometer, diode detector monitoring the approximately 700 MHz beat
 signal, or by some other means.  (On later versions of the SP-117/A, this
 step can be postponed until later, as the polarizer is accessible from
 the front of the laser head once the bezel is removed.)

<li>Reinstall the completed assembly into the laser head cylinder with the
 control cable coming out of the rear plate aligned with the output aperture
 label or shutter lever.  Secure it with the 12 setscrews that were there
 originally.  Adjustment of these setscrews can be used for centering and
 alignment of the output beam.

The SP-117 and SP-117A laser heads are nearly identical but there are some
subtle differences which will need to be taken into account.  Some photos

properly. :)

<h3><A NAME="htrmg925">Melles Griot 05-LHP-925 Won't Start</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: MG 05-LHP-925 from eBay.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Won't start regardless of power supply.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Starting was attempted on both a MG 05-LHP-915
 as well as the 05-LPM-945 - one of the largest highest voltage HeNe laser
 power supplies available.  The only observation of note was that there was
 a very small current flowing - about 0.5 mA - even though the laser would
 not start.
</ul>
<p>
The seller of this laser claimed it "powered up".  We know that "powered up"
doesn't necessarily mean much in an auction listing but could it be that
this laser indeed did run for the seller but somehow is not comatose?
<p>
There are only two reasons for a current of this magnitude.  Either the tube
is nearly up to air and can't sustain any significant current, or there is
electrical leakage.  Healthy HeNe lasers will have essentially no current
until they start.
<p>
So, the next test was to pull off the anode (cable-end) end-cap and use a
hand-held Oudin (Tesla) coil to check for gas integrity.  (Reliably exciting
the gas in the tube through a long cable with an Oudin coil might not be
reliable and would thus be inconclusive if there was no glow.)
Indeed, the tube lit up a healthy orange red color with even the minimum
output from the Oudin coil.  So, it's probably not a gas problem, although
it could still be a hard-start tube.
<p>
Next, the head was powered via a jumper cable, bypassing the original Alden
cable and end-cap entirely.  This still didn't work.
<p>
The only remaining source of electrical leakage is the start tape which runs
from the anode the entire length of the tube.  It's supposed to be well
insulated, but these may cause problems if an attempt is made to run the
laser in an excessively humid environment and there is any defect in the
adhesion of the Mylar insulating tape.
<p>
So, I performed a starttapeotomy by cutting the start tape off of the anode
mirror mount and stuffing its tail down inside the head cylinder.  This went
smoothly without complications.  The laser then started right up on the
05-LPM-915 power supply, first time, every time.  The output power after OC
mirror tweaking isn't great, but acceptable for these sorts of surplus
lasers - about 15 mW after warmup.  (It's rated
17 mW.)
<p>
The original buyer of this laser head is located in a very humid climate.
So, possibly he was overly eager to test the laser right out of the box
off the cool truck, and some condensation found its way inside the head.
<p>
Conclusions: Patient is cured.  In my opinion, the start tape on Melles Griot
HeNe lasers causes more trouble than can be justified by the statistical
improvement in start time that it supposedly provides.

<h3><A NAME="htrsp155">Spectra-Physics Model 155 Won't Start</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: SP-155 in perfect physical condition.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Won't start.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Fuse was checked and found to be good.  Output
 of HV transformer secondary was very low, almost shorted.  Removing
 one connection to power supply PCB caused it to return to normal.
</ul>
<p>
So, something in the HV power supply was probably shorted.  First, the
HV diode feeding the filter capacitor bank was lifted.  This didn't help
indicating that the fault was in the HV multiplier.  Disconnecting the
first 500 pF 6 kV capacitor feeding the multiplier allowed the
AC from the transformer and DC on the filter capacitors to return to normal.
After systematically lifting several HV diodes and capacitors, it was found
that the problem was the first 500 pF 6 kV cap.  It must have been shorted
or shorting at very low voltage.
<p>
Replacing the cap with a 1,000 pF, 15 kV part (the closest I had available!),
seemed to fix the problem and the tube lit up.  However, it soon became
obvious that it wasn't going to start reliably at normal line voltage.
Only when boosted to 125 VAC or more, did it start consistently.  And, even
then, it wasn't usually instantaneous.  It doesn't appear as though the
starting circuit is the problem as it produces nice juicy sparks to my
Simpson 260 probe even after some time following being powered off.  So,
it's probably a hard start tube.
<p>
So, a Sam-special start wire was added, soldered to the positive output
of the power supply where it connects to the red anode wire, and wrapped
several times around the narrow glass tube stem just beyond the cathode.
This seems to start first time, every time, and instantly every time.
In fact, there appears to be a pre-ionization flash when the power switch
is flipped just before the main discharge goes on continuously.
A start wire won't be useful if the tube is hard-running since it will
tend to turn the tube off as readily as it turns it on and the result
will be a flashing laser.  But this tube stays lit down to something
like 70 VAC.  It's just hard starting.
<p>
Conclusions: The original problem may have been the hard starting tube,
causing stress on the HV capacitor and its failure.  It's possible that
this may have blown the fuse if allowed to be in the shorted state
unattended, but the person who worked on it before me had replaced it.
Now the patient seems healthy enough, easy starting, runs without problems,
and has an output power of about 0.9 mW.

<h3><A NAME="htrl7512">Two Tortured LASOS LGK7512P Yellow HeNe Laser Heads</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients</b>: Two LGK7512P yellow (594.1 nm) polarized HeNe laser heads
 in generally decent physical condition.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Patient #1 won't start and Patient #2 produces a beam
 but it is partially blocked by something.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: NA.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> Both laser heads were powered using a Melles Griot
 05-LPL-171 HeNe laser power supply.  Multiple power cycles didn't result
 in any starting of Patient #1.  Inspecting the output aperture of Patient
 #2 revealed some melted plastic partially blocking the beam.
</ul>
<p>
Since Patient #2 at least started, some exploratory surgery was in
order.  The front end-caps on these laser heads are just press-fit
into the cylinder.  So, using my custom laser head end-cap extractor
(a 3/8" thick aluminum plate with 4 holes drilled through it so that
screws can be attached to the end-cap), the end-cap on #2 was wiggled
loose and pulled off.  Then, the problem became immediately obvious:
The plastic "cup" in which the anode ballast resistance was potted in
red rubber stuff had partially melted!  Once this was removed, the
beautiful yellow beam in all its glory reappeared!  Why had the
plastic melted?  I have a theory and this will be discussed later.
After using a variety of small tools including reamers and drill bits
to clear out the melted plastic, the laser head could be reassembled.
After warmup, the output power was measured at greater than 2.6 mW for
this laser rated at 2 mW.  Not too shabby and close enough to the 2.73 mW
scribbled on a sticker as to be considered as good as new.
<p>
Now on to Patient #1 which wouldn't start.  Something inside seemed to
rattle which is usually not a good sign.  After removing the front
end-cap as with #1, it appeared as though the ballast of this laser
head was also somewhat melted, though not nearly as badly.  I tested
for continuity from the Alden connector to the anode of the tube and
that was fine, as was the negative connection to the cylinder.  At
this point, I was fairly sure the tube was broken and up to air but
before pronouncing the Patient #1 dead, there was the test of last
resort: The Oudin coil.  And sure enough, applying some nice high
frequency high voltage sparks to the anode mirror mount revealed a
healthy orange glow inside the tube.  There's nothing wrong with the
gas in this tube!  So, the only other explanation would be that the
connection between the cathode and cylinder/negative of the Alden was
open.
<p>
The rear end-cap doesn't come off nearly as easily as the front one.  Working
around the perimeter with a sharp blade along with removing the cable clamp
enabled it to be pulled free.  Sure enough, the wire for the cathode
mirror mount was just dangling!  And, there was a cathode ballast resistor
which was clearly fried to a crisp.  Curiouser and curiouser.  With a
trusty alligator jumper lead between the mirror mount and the cylinder, Patient
#1 started up just fine.  After installing a new resistor (guessing 10K, 1 W
would be fine since 0 ohms worked fine), it also produces about 2.6 mW after
warmup.
<p>
So what happened to cause very similar failures of both these lasers?  One
possibility is that there was a power supply failure resulting in excessive
current to the tube.  The optimal current is 6.5 mA.  If the current increased
to, say, 8 mA, the power dissipated in the ballast resistors would go up
by 50 percent.  At 9 mA, it would be almost twice as high.  Higher current
wouldn't exactly be too good for the tube over time, but the additional heating
could likely be much more immediately damaging to the ballasts.  The crisped
remains of the cathode ballast resistor didn't appear to be rated more than
1/2 W and would be dissipating over 0.4 W under normal operating conditions.
The anode ballast resistors are potted in red rubber stuff so there is no
way to know what their ratings are, but possibly that conformal coating
helped to spare them the same fate, simply passing the excess heat to the
plastic shell, which showed signs of melting in both patients, but more
seriously in Patient #2.  Patient #2 has a relatively recent date of
manufacture (compared to now, which is August 2006): November 2005,
so it may have been a replacement for Patient #1 (which is from September
2003) after it failed completely.  When Patient #2 also failed with the
blocked beam - and likely rather quickly - someone probably realized there
was a problem with the power supply.
<p>
Conclusions: Both Patients #1 and #2 seem to be fine now.  The cathode
ballast resistor in Patient #2 was not replaced since there are presently
no symptoms, but it should be monitored to make sure that problems don't
develop in the future.  But perhaps a higher power resistor was used
and it survived.  Unfortunately, there is no way to determine the
actual history of these lasers so the runaway power supply hypothesis will
have to suffice for a cause.

<h3><A NAME="htrreo1">REO One-Brewster Tube - No Lasing</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: REO One-Brewster HeNe laser tube from Ohmeda Raman
 anesthesia gas analyzer.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Excessively pink discharge, no output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> The laser was run for a few hours in situ
 with no obvious change.  Some tentative mirror adjustment was attempted
 with no lasing.  The power supply and mirrors seem fine.  However, the
 alignment of the internal HR mirror was checked and found to be perfect.
</ul>
<p>
This is the third sample of this system that I've acquired.  (See the
section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henorga">The Ohmeda Raman Gas Analyzer
One-Brewster Laser</A>.)  The first two lasers were fine with healthy
tubes.  The tube in this one is obviously sick.  Its complexion is decidedly
too pinkish and the brightness of the discharge is also somewhat weak.
In addition, it exhibited the "swirling lightning bolt syndrome", apparently
typical of contaminated PMS/REO tubes with nearly full length cathodes.
While most of the staff thought there was no hope with no possibility of
successful treatment, something about this patient demanded that an effort
at least be made.  Extended running time on normal power is a last resort
option for these cases.  While the success rate is low, the cost is minimal.
<p>
It seems that for these high-Q tubes, REO still uses a soft-seal for the
B-window to minimize stress.  Either that, or the optical contacting wasn't
entire successful since the tube definitely leaked.
<p>
So, the tube was separated from the rest of the assembly and simply allowed
to run on its original power supply for 8 to 12 hours a day over the course
of three weeks.
<p>
Initially, the only indication that this was having any effect at all was
a subtle improvement in the discharge color more toward the normal "salmon".
However, the brightness of the discharge was still obviously low.  Periodic
checking for lasing with an SP-084 HR mirror was negative.
<p>
Since there was some, if minor, improvement in complexion, it was decided to
order some additional tests.  A complete spectral scan using a Verity
monochromator-detector was performed for this patient as well as another
similar REO 1-B tunable laser tube (details to follow).  However, the
results of these scans were rather inconclusive.  It was expected that
there would be some sort of contamination or low pressure.  But there
was no indication of significant non-He or non-Ne spectral lines and
in particular, little or no hydrogen.  The ratios of He:Ne were also
similar to healthy tubes.  Perhaps, if the detector gain was cranked
way up, H<sub>2</sub> contamination at 656 nm would have become apparent - even
a very small amount of H<sub>2</sub> - something like ten parts per million -
will kill lasing.
<p>
The next test to be performed was for double pass gain.  A Melles Griot
05-LHR-911 HeNe laser was sent through the Brewster window and reflected
off the internal HR.  This is the "probe" beam.  A non-polarizing
beamsplitter reflected a portion of the return beam to a laser power meter.
By turning the REO tube's power on and off, the change in power of the
probe beam could be determined.  (The 05-LHR-911 had to be warmed up for
at least a half hour so its mode sweep power variations wouldn't confuse
the readings.  And, it was confirmed that the bore discharge glow didn't
affect the measurement significantly.)  Here are very approximate results:
<p>
<PRE>
   Time on Therapy    Double Pass Gain    Discharge Appearance
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       14 days            0.25 %          Still weak, but salmon color
       18 days            0.50 %          Swirling lightning bolts disappear
       20 days            0.75 %          Brightness improving
       21 days            1.50 %          Nearly normal complexion
       22 days            3.00 % *
</PRE>
<p>
There was just enough improvement in the appearance of the discharge over
the first two weeks to suggest that a positive outcome was possible even
if continued testing with the SP-084 HR was unsuccessful.  But once the
double pass gain reached 1.5 % I was thinking: "This has to work now!". :)
<p>
And, indeed, finally, it was possible to easily obtain flashes using
the hand-held SP-084 HR mirror.  So, the patient was put back together,
first with the same HR mirror to allow for initial cleaning of the Brewster
window.  Then, the Brewster prism assembly was installed, aligned, and cleaned.
The output power has continued to climb, especially for the orange (611.9 nm).
(* With the intact patient, there is no easy way to measure the gain, which
also no doubt would be seen to increase.  For this length tube, 3 perecnt
double pass gain would be my estimate.)
<p>

<p>
* This 60 uW increase in orange power was due to window cleaning.  Any increase
due to gas cleanup seemed to be minimal, if any, when the cleaning was done.
However, the output power then increased another 50+ uW over the next
several hours and the next day.  + Indicates that the red power is actually
slightly greater than the value shown since it was measured before the end
of the "day".
<p>
Note that a "day" is actually about 10 to 14 hours of run time.  The laser
sleeps when I sleep. :)
<p>
The status for last full test is shown below:
<p>
<PRE>
               Power from   Power from
   Wavelength  Internal HR  External HR
 ----------------------------------------
    632.8 nm      864 uW      147 uW
    611.9 nm    2,080 uW       29 uW
    604.6 nm        0 uW        0 uW
</PRE>
<p>
The total power out both ends for red is much greater than that of the
other two samples of this laser assembly which had no problems, though the
exact split of power between the internal and external HR mirrors differs.
But that is a mirror issue.  The intracavity power isn't known, but based
on measurements of one of the other lasers, it may be as high as 10 WATTs or
even more.  And, the total power for the 611.9 orange line is actually
significantly higher than the other lasers.  However, unlike those, there
is no evidence of the 604.6 nm orange line.  This, too, is probably a mirror
issue since the requirements in the Raman analyzer are only for high
circulating power for the red line.
<p>
However, based on a guess as to the meaning of the "S" and "T" parameters
(See the section: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henorga">The Ohmeda Raman Gas Analyzer
REO One-Brewster Laser</A>.), the present performance for red may only be less
than 1/4 of what's possible if this laser was new and had perfectly clean
optics.
<p>
Conclusions: The performance of this laser for 632.8 and 611.9 nm is now
better than that of the other 2 known good samples.  There is now little
change from one day to the next.  It's not known whether the contamination
originated inside the tube, or from leakage through the soft-sealed B-window.
The patient has been discharged (no pun...) but will probably need to have
periodic run time to maintain good health.
<p>
Update 1: At the first followup visit, approximately 1 month later, the
611.9 nm output power (the only wavelength tested) reached 95 percent of its
post-treatement value within 1/2 hour, but didn't seem to want
to climb higher, and then declined a few percent.  Cleaning the B-window had no
effect, though other surfaces could still have gotten contaminated.
But after a couple more power cycles, it was up to 98 percent, close
enough for government work. :)  After a few more power cycles, it
peaked at the original power but wouldn't hold it, so it was run for
another 14 hours straight, at which point it recovered and maintained
to slightly greater than post-treatment power.  (The increase may have
been due to the additional Brewster cleaning.)  Continuous running is
probably what should have been done.  Forget that stuff about power
cycling on basically healthy tubes! :)  When the tube gets hot, it
outgases contaminants from various surfaces causing the reduction in
power.  But only at that point can the weak gettering of the cathode
have any effect.  As long as the power only declines slightly,
just continue running and it will recover.
<p>
So, it would appear based on the results of this followup treatment, that the
laser loses about 5 percent of its output power per month from being idle,
and that running it a couple hours per day, or one day a week may be needed to
avoid this decline.  Another followup will follow in 1 month.
<p>
Update 2: At the second followup visit 1 month later, the 611.9 nm orange
power peaked at 2.01 mW, then declined to 1.98 mW after 1/2 hour.  But
after running straight for about 23 hours (no sleep), it had recovered to
2.10 mW.  And after another 12 hours, had reached 2.14 mW, higher than
the last visit.  The patient was asked to return in 2 months.
<p>
Update 3: After two months of non-use, the orange power after an initial
warmup period of 1/2 hour was only 1.9 mW but recovered fully to 2.14 mW
after about 50 hours of continuous exercise.  The patient was asked to
return in 6 months.  I wish it would do this on its own though. :)
<p>
Although running soft-seal HeNe lasers is recommended for continued health,
and extended run time for a weak or zero-output tube may help sometimes,
in my experience, only PMS/REO tubes have a good chance of recovering to
like-new performance using this technique.  However, there seem to be three
types of sick PMS/REO tubes with a weak or pink discharge:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Type 1: Running at normal operating current for 10s of hours will restore
 to near-new specifications.  This has also been behavior of an old LSTP laser
 (not mine) and with the laser in an Ohmeda anesthesia Raman gas analyzer.
<p>
<li>Type 2: Running at normal operating current for 10s of hours may result in
 some improvement but continuation results in output power going down.  An
 additional characteristic is that when turned on from a cold start, the
 output power will initially be much higher, perhaps near-spec, but then
 will die away within a few seconds to minutes.
<p>
<li>Type 3: No amount of run time has any effect on either discharge appearance
 or output power, which is probably 0.0 mW.  My guess is that this is simply
 (2) if continued to run into the ground.
</ol>
<p>
Also, PMS/REO tubes seem to have one unique characteristic when they are
gassy.  Namely, that if one looks down the inside of the tube from the
glass-end, there will be swirling white-ish streamers visible between
the cathode and bore.  And, it has been suggested that when the swirling
clouds are present, it's a good indication that extended run time will
result in a successful cure.  What is the cause?
<p>
Update 4: As expected, the patient negelcted to schedule a visit and it's
been about 1 year since the last followup.  Unfortunately, this meant that
recovery will be lengthy and costly, if possible at all.

</PRE>
<p>
The only wavelength that is being monitored is 611.9 nm since this has been
shown to track the 632.8 nm output quite reliably.  Since the power seemed
to be leveling off after 6 days, it was decided to do a Brewster
window cleaning, which resulted in the output power immediately
increasing to 1.912 mW, and then somewhat unexpectantly further
increasing to 1.968 mW, within about 5 percent of the previous best value.
Knowing that this patient will not stay clean over the long run, the more
risky and expensive tuning prism cleaning was not performed.  However,
assuming a similar degree of contamination on each of two surfaces,
that would almost certainly restore full power, and possibly more.

 (611.9 nm) initially climbed to 1.451 mW and then declined to around 1.259 mW
 over about 1/2 hour (about 13 percent), even with constant mirror alignment
 adjustments.  This behavior is more-or-less repeatable.
</ul>
<p>
Here's a case where it's a good idea to get periodic checkups.  Had I not
been treating the other REO laser, this patient would probably never have been
evaluated at all.  And, this classic case of low poweritis may have progress to
the point where serious intervention would be needed, if it could be treated
at all.  As it is, running for a few days should be sufficient to restore
it to perfect health.  In fact, better than before since it had never been
run long enough for complete gas cleanup to occur.
<p>
The following time-line starts at the point of peak output, about 5 minutes
after power-on:
<p>
<PRE>
            &lt;------------ Internal HR ------------>

  6.5 hours    ----     1,312 uW    -5 uW     -0.3 %
</PRE>
<p>
Here, "hours" are real non-relativistic time; if it gets to days, they
will be my normal 12 hours or so/day. :)
<p>
If the treatment is interrupted for even a few seconds, there is a
short term increase in power.  If interrupted for a few minutes, the
entire progression starting near peak power, declining to a minimum,
and then recovering to the steady state power (about 1,312 uW), repeats.
It's not clear at this point if simply running the laser for any amount
of time will be successful.  But it is almost certainly a gas contamination
problem.
<p>
Alert!!! Patient went into partial photon arrest during cleaning.  I attempted
to clean the B-window and then the Brewster prism.  The power kept declining.
I am not aware of any obvious problem with the tube and no damage to any of
the optics surfaces or the external HR mirror.  After multiple attempts at
cleaning including completely removing the mirror and cleaning (carefully),
output power on 611.9 nm is only about 1/10th of what it was before.  There
is no 604.6 nm at all.  Long term intensive care may be required.
<p>
After a frustrating lack of improvement from optics cleaning, exploratory
surgery was called for.  So, the Brewster prism/external HR assembly was
removed and replaced with a 98 percent 632.8 nm OC mirror.  On another
similar laser assembly (Laser 1 from the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henorga">The Ohmeda Raman Gas Analyzer REO One-Brewster
Laser</A>), this results in 5.4 mW of output power.  However, on this
laser, it maxes out at 2.8 mW.  There is virtually no detectable
scatter on the Brewster window and the mirror is clean (or at least as
clean as it was when Laser 1 was tested).  While the internal HRs on
this laser and Laser 1 differ in their reflectivity, it is still very
very high on both and thus the beam out of the internal HR should not be
a significant factor.  I can't absolutely confirm
that the tube current is correct, but varying the input voltage to the
power supply results in negligible change in output power implying that
the power supply is regulating properly.  Thus, the current has almost
certainly not changed.  So, where the missing power went is a mystery, but
no doubt with 632.8 nm well below expectation, the 611.9 nm power will
be very small.
<p>
Here are some vital stats without the Brewster prism and REO external HR:

<h3><A NAME="htrreo3">REO One-Brewster Tube - Very Low Output</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: REO One-Brewster HeNe laser tube in particle counter
 assembly.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Power is very low with dim pink discharge.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: Approximately 5 uW and 15 uW at 632.8 nm from internal
   and external HR mirrors, respectively.
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: TEM00.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> When run on an adjustable HeNe laser power supply,
 the discharge showed obvious signs of contamination.  The color was pink
 and it wasn't as bright as normal.  At first there was no output at all,
 but within a few minutes, a very faint beam appeared, which are what the
 measurements of 5 uW and 15 uW reflect.  Output power increased with
 increasing current.
</ul>
<p>
This is the resonator assembly from the unit described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henreo1">The REO One-Brewster Particle Counter HeNe
Laser</A>.  This is a basic one-Brewster resonator with no tuning prism or
other intracavity optical elements.  But unlike the patients in
the two previous sections, the bore discharge is clearly visible from an
exposed section of the glass portion of the tube.  So, the sickly
complexion was immediately obvious.  Knowing that PMS/REO HeNe lasers
have a good chance of recovering with extended run time, that
treatment approach was initiated.  I'm actually rather surprised it lased
at all.
<p>
Since this unit has HR mirrors at both ends of the laser, even a perfectly
healthy tube won't result in huge output power - output from both ends are
waste beams.  But since the tube is similar to ones in other similar systems,
they should be higher than 5 uW and 15 uW!  This laser has a manufacturing
date of 1996 - over 10 years of age.  However, when it was taken out of
service is not known.
<p>
Whoever salvaged the laser decided it would be creative to cut the power
supply wires literally 1/4 inch from the Voltex HeNe laser power supply
module.  Attaching new wires was a real treat, especially attempting to
insulate the one for the high voltage!  Hopefully, the multiple layers of
heat shrink tubing and electrical tape will be adequate.  For now, it does
work without unsightly incidents such as arcing or meltdowns! :)
<p>
The external HR mirror was inspected and appeared perfectly clean, and
the Brewster window was cleaned without any significant change.
<p>
But sure enough, improvement in both output power and discharge appearance was
evident very quickly, with the approximate measurements below:
<p>

</PRE>
<p>
At this point, two things were done.  First, 2 of the 3 IR suppression
magnets were re-glued in what I thought were the same position as they
were originally.  (The original glue job was ugly!)  And, an external OC
was substituted for the internal OC to be able to determine intracavity
power and the reflectivity (or transmission) of the REO HR mirrors.
This all went smoothly and after the external HR was replaced, the
laser seemed to be happy, with similar waste beam power as before surgery.
<p>
However, a critical situation requiring emergency care developed!  The waste
beam power started declining slowly but surely until after several hours, it
was down to about half of the last measurement above.  There was no obvious
explanation for this turn of events.  Since the power had not changed
after re-installing the external HR, contamination on its surface was
unlikely.  But the Brewster window was checked and cleaned with no change.
Alignment was checked and found to be perfect.  Tube current was unchanged
at 5 mA.  The only possible explanation other than an unlikely coincidence
that the tube just decided to become end-of-life was that the position and/or
orientation of the magnets was not the same and somehow, this resulted in
the power falloff.  I know that's a stretch but when one has eliminated all
the likely suspects....
<p>
The first thing I tried was to restore the magnets as best I could to what
I thought was precisely the original position and orientation.  This was
based partially on photos of the unmodified assembly and partially on my
recollection.  But this didn't seem to make much difference and the decline
continued.
<p>
So, it was time for desperate action!  The tube was pulled from
the particle counter assembly and placed in my one-Brewster tube
intensive care unit (1-B ICU) with the 99 percent OC mirror and no magnets.
Its initial behavior was not promising.  When powered
on from a cold start after having been off for 24 hours, the output power
would peak at over 3 mW within a few seconds and then decline over the
course of a few minutes to less than 1.5 mW and appeared to be continuing
its steady decline.  Maximum output power was achieved with a tube current
of around 6 mA when the laser was first turned on.  But as the output
power declined, the current for maximum power increased to beyond where
it would be safe to run the laser.  Once the output power (at the normal
tube current of 5 mA) declined to 1.5 mW, power was turned off to avoid
doing something irreversible.  This cycle could be repeated (after waiting
24 hours).  (The peaking and rapid decline in power was evident with the
laser in the particle counter assembly, but was only a 10 or 20 percent
difference, not the more than 2:1 as it is with the OC mirror.)
<p>
So, an emergency conference of the department heads was convened. :)
It was decided that there was nothing to lose by simply allowing the
laser to run continuously as there were no other treatment options
available.  (Regasing would not have been covered by laser's health
insurance plan.)  And then, soemthing totally unexpected happened:
The power bottomed out at around 1.3 mW and started climbing:

<p>
Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Values for "Change/24 hours" were interpolated if an exact multiple of
 24 hours was not available.
<p>
<li>The therapy current was increased to 5.5 mA from 5.0 mA after 130 hours
 to assure stabilily on the adjustable unregulated HeNe laser power uspply.
 The clean tube appears to have a higher negative resistance and higher
 dropout current using the original ballast resistance and the discharge
 was tending to go out and restart on AC line fluctuation.
<p>
<li>Originally, when the tube was very weak at 1.3 mW, but started at around
 3 mW, the output power initially would peak with a current of around 6 mA.
 Once the power declined, the current for maximum power would go too high
 to safely run the tube, even for measurements.  However, once the sustained
 power had climbed above about 3 mW, the current for peak
 power dropped to around 7.0 mA.  This somewhat higher than common current
 may be correct for this multi-spatial mode wide-bore laser.  The peak has
 been very close to 7.0 mA since 29 hours when the current is increased
 (from the therapy current of 5.0 or 5.5 mA) for measurements.  There is
 an uncertainly of perhaps 0.1 mA but no statistically significant movement
 since then.
</ol>
<p>
I've never heard of IR suppression magnets affecting gas cleanup behavior
but that is the only explanation that makes any sense.  And the rapid
repeatable drop in power was definitely a gas contamination issue, so that
eliminates any issues with Brewster window cleaning or the external HR mirror.
My hypothesis is that the change in magnetic field disturbed the
location of the discharge.  The magnets that probably were responsible
were the ones at the cathode-end of the tube.  There, the discharge is
spread out where it hits the cathode, and that would be susceptible to
being moved by the magnetic field.  Originally, the two magnets located
there had the same poles (N or S) facing the tube.  However, when I
re-glued one of those, I had opposing poles facing the tube so they would
attract each-other and hold the magnets in place while the glue dried.  This
made no difference in terms of IR suppression, but could have had a big impact
on pushing the discharge around.  In the 1-B ICU, there is now no field,
so it will be interesting to to see what effect replacing the magnets
will have on behavior.  If this is repeatable, there could be something
significant and potentially useful going on, perhaps with implications
for the treatment of other lasers.
<p>
Why does discharge location influence gas cleanup?  The areas of ion
bombardment and heating changed and this must be affecting the "bad gas"
atoms.  So they are being trapped and released from the cathode surface.
Or something. :)
<p>
I do wonder if some of the very slow improvement near the end is actually due
to the tube aging.  This may have been a nearly unused laser.  New tubes are
often overfilled to maximize run time life, and the discharge seems a bit
brighter and more orange than typical for common HeNe lasers.  
<p>
After completion of treatment, the tube was returned to its body.  The
intracavity power was found to have increased by over 92 percent to
over 10 WATTs!  This was at a tube current of 5 mA.  The
intracavity power reaches almost 12 W at around 7.0 mA.  Power
from a cold start now increases monotonically, initially at about
80 percent of the final value (at 5.0 mA).
<p>
The patient will be monitored for awhile to
confirm stability but any dramatic change is unlikely.  The only
difference between the 1-B ICU and the particle counter assembly is
the (rotational) orientation of the tube.  And, I'm not prepared to
believe that gravity will have a detectable effect!!! :)

This is now the total time from when the tube was first turned and was
very weak.  It is more or less continuous, running day and night for over
7 days straight except for a gap of 2 days between the first and second
sets of data, above (before entering the 1-B ICU), and while the tube
was being installed back into the particle counter assembly.  At this
point, the output power has essentially leveled off, within the
measurement uncertainty.
<p>
The amount of scatter off the Brewster window is rather small considering
the intracavity power.  So, I bet if the external HR was similar to the
internal HR, perhaps 50 percent more intracavity power might be possible.
<p>
The magnets do not seem to have any profound effect when momentarily installing
them to check power, so they will be left off for now at least.  We can do
without relapses!
<p>
Conclusions: If as is likely, this laser has been out of service for several
years, then the treatment should result in decent performance being maintained
without requiring frequent running to clean up gas contamination.  This will
require one or more followup visits to confirm.  The next test will be to see
if replacing the magnets results in this entire decline and restore cycle
to be repeated.  That seems likely.  Since the increase in performance
with the magnets is only a few percent, it may be best to simply not
re-install the magnets at the cathode-end of the tube, or to move them a
bit further toward the anode so that the effect is inside the bore
rather than at the spread-out cathode discharge.  Some futher testing
may be performed in the future to determine which approach is best.
But that won't happen for awhile.  The first followup visit will be
in 1 month.
<p>
Update 1: In about 1 month, the laser was run for several hours at the
normal 5.0 mA.  It started at 131 uW (from the internal HR) and climbed
to 160 uW after about 8 hours but didn't seem to be increasing any
further.  Since there are many opportunities for contamination to enter
despite the various seals, a Brewster cleaning was ordered and resulted
in 175 uW.  Slightly more power might be possible.  It's not clear how much
of the improvement is due to the Brewster cleaning but almost certainly
much of it.  The next followup will be in 2 months.
<p>
One interesting observation - not unique to this particular laser - is that
when the boot is put back into place after cleaning the Brewster window, the
output power will actually *increase* slightly over the next minute or so.
The change is only 1 or 2 percent, but it is real and is not
associated with a shift in alignment, nor probably
to residual solvent evaporating or something
like that as might be suspected.  Rather, the reason is likely that dust
particles that entered the (hopefully) sealed interior of the cavity
when it was open to my non-clean room lab are settling out.  Thus they
are no longer producing scatter of the intracavity beam, and its associated
power loss.  Short of figuring out how to get the particle counter
photodetector and electronics working, it may be possible confirm this
by looking for optical noise in the waste beam to decline over time after the
boot is put back into place.  Something for the future!
<p>
Update 2: As is typical with these patients, the next followup was not in
2 months, but more like 6 months.  However, the laser must have been
eating  ealthy and exercising regularly as its performance after only
1/2 hour was very close to previous values - 170 and 483 uW.

<h3><A NAME="htrpms1">PMS One-Brewster Tube - No Lasing</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient</b>: PMS One-Brewster HeNe laser tube from older PMS LSTP-1010
 tunable HeNe laser.
<li><b>Symptoms</b>: Excessively pink discharge, no output.
<li><b>Vital signs</b>:
 <ul>
  <li>Output power: 0.0 mW
  <li>Optimal current: NA.
  <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<li><b>Initial tests:</b> The laser was initially not aligned, so this had
 to be done before anything else.  Fortunately, the "peaking the bore light"
 method works well for these lasers.  Only red (633 nm) could be obtained.
</ul>
<p>
This patient came in a PMS LSTP-1010 5 color tunable HeNe laser, probably
one of the most way-cool HeNe lasers ever produced. When operating properly,
the output can be selected among 5 wavelengths:
red (632.8 nm), orange 1 (611.9 nm), orange 2 (604.6 nm), yellow (594.1 nm),
and green (543.5 nm).  However, when I acquired this tube in 2002.  It was
already very sick and capable of only a few hundred microwatts of red
continuously, and perhaps a flash of orange when initially turned on.
It continued to decline from there.  I had pretty much given up on it
until attempting to revive the PMS tube described in the previous
section.  It was convenient to perform a spectral scan on this one as
well, and the results were virtually identical.  This provided hope that
it too could be revived with extended run time.  It is now 2007 and at least
the appearance of its discharge hasn't changed detectably in 5 years!
<p>
So the plan is to run this tube while checking its double pass gain
periodically over several hundred hours if necessary.  As before,
the double pass gain will be monitored by reflecting a red HeNe
laser beam up and back from its internal Brewster window
and extracting a portion of the return beam with a beamsplitter.
First, I used my trusty reliable Melles Griot 05-LHR-911.  But that
laser takes 2 hours to warm up to the point where the power variation
due to mode sweep is slow enough to deduce a small change in reflected
power when the PMS laser is turned on and off.  So, I substituted a
Spectra-Physics 117C stabilized laser which settles down in 10 to 15
minutes from a cold start.  Might as well use it for something! :)
Although I haven't figured out how to switch it to intensity stabilized
mode from frequency stabilized mode (it's a jumper block and I haven't
found any docuementation!), the total power is still quite constant.
<p>
Its initial condition is that the double pass gain is around 0.75 percent.
This is somewhat higher than I had expected, but with its internal OC mirror
likely having a reflectivity of 99 percent (transmission of 1 percent) for
632.8 nm, no red lasing is even possible.  And testing for other wavelengths
won't be done until it does decent power for red.
<p>
Even with the stabilized laser, the power readings still fluctuate enough
to be confusing, so I constructed a simple passive circuit to take the
difference of the difference between the incident and reflected beams, adjusted
for equal gain.  It would have been better to normalize this result
automatically, but that would have required a divide somewhere which was
more work than I really wanted!  Another option would be to capture the
measurements with a data acquisition system and do the calculations with
a C program or MATLAB.  For now, the passive circuit will do. :)
<p>
<PRE>
  Time      Gain      Comments
---------------------------------------------------------------
  Day 1    0.75 %     Started  5.25 mA,  slightly pink
  Day 2    0.80 %     Small improvement, still somewhat pink
  Day 4    1.00 %        "             "             "
  Day 9    1.00 %     Unchanged
</PRE>
<p>
Due to the large uncertainty in the measurement of gain, "unchanged"
doesn't really mean much, just that the change, if any, wasn't dramatic.
<p>
Interestingly, for a few seconds after being powered on after being
un-powered for awhile, a weak red beam would appear and then die
out quickly.  If the "off" duration was several hours, the beam might
start out at around 1 mW and take 25 seconds to
disappear completely.  With a shorter rest,
there would be a less intense beam of shorter duration.
This is similar behavior to what it was doing several years
ago, but then the output power was higher (with some orange even possible
when installed in the tunable laser case)
and the duration of the lasing was longer.  At that time, extended running
had at best no effect, and possibly was making it worse.  But, it has
obviously deteriorated further since then.
<p>
Conclusions: After several days with absolutely no change, it seemed obvious
that the tube was too far gone to recover.  Will probably try again in
the future though.  At least, it doesn't now appear to be deteriorating
while sitting on the shelf.  If only, those bad gas atoms or molecules
could be dispatched to a place where they wouldn't interfere!

This is an interesting early (probably late 1970s) polarized HeNe laser tube.
It consists of a soft-sealed two-Brewster plasma tube with full diameter
glass extensions on which the mirrors are mounted.  The OC mirror is Epoxied
in place but the HR mirror is on a 4-screw (yes, 4) adjustable mount.
The HR mirror itself is rectangular which almost certainly means it's planar
and cut from a larger piece.  (This is the only rectangular cavity mirror
I've ever see on a HeNe laser!)  But it is also about the most finicky
mirror as well.  Breathing on the mount changes alignment, and power
variations due to thermally alignment changes can be 2:1 or more.
<p>
The discharge color was excessively pink and there was no beam, even after
fiddling with the (adjustable) rear mirror.  This color discharge sometimes
means that recovery is possible with extended run time.  So, the patient was
placed on continuous run current therapy and sure enough, after a few hours,
a beam appeared.
<p>
The original treatment was performed a year or so ago and unfortunately,
the records were lost.  However, now (2007), retreatment was needed since
these soft-seal tubes deteriorate with non-use.  An I must admit to neglecting
the required frequent petting to keep this one happy.
<p>
Here are the stats for the retreatment.
<p>
<PRE>
  Time on     Output
  Therapy     Power     Comments
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Start      0.0 mW    Initial powerup after long rest.
   12 hours   0.6 mW
   24 hours   1.1 mW
   36 hours   1.1 mW
   48 hours   1.1 mW
   60 hours   1.2 mW
   72 hours   1.3 mW
   84 hours   1.4 mW    1.8+ mW peak with magnets during warmup.
   96 hours   1.7 mW
  108 hours   1.8+ mW   Will not stay lit below 7 mA.
</PRE>
<p>
The tube was allowed to rest at night, so each treatment period was
approximately 12 hours.  The power output reading is the peak that could be
obtained by pressing on the HR mirror mount.  Running continously (no rest
at night) would probably improve it slightly, but the decay rate is
so high that it could only be maintained with nearly continuous running.
What's interesting that the tube does seem to be able to recover to having an
output power similar to what it was when I first got it.
<p>
This tube was always very particular about current and required a 10K
cathode ballast resistor to run stably at 6.5 mA, but now as the gas
cleanup has progressed, needed 7 mA to be happy.  In addition, if
the discharge dropped out and attempted to restart, there would tend to
be a very weak glow inside and outside of the bore for several seconds
or longer until it actually started.  This is very unusual for any tube.
<p>
Conclusions: It's possible that running for more time would get it closer
to the spec of 4 mW, though this is doubtful.  However, the high current
means that a normal life will never be possible.  I don't know for sure
what the optimum current was supposed to be, but it certainly was less
than 7 mA!  The patient has been sent home with instructions to return
every few days for treatment.  But it almost certainly won't, so we'll be
doing this full regiment again in the future. :)
