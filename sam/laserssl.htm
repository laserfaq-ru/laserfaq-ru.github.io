<h2>Characteristics, Structure, Safety, Common Types</h2>

Note: Due to the amount of material, information on specific commercial
solid state lasers has moved to its own chapter:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#ccltoc">Commercial SS Lasers</A>.

<h3><A NAME="sslint">Introduction to Solid State Lasers</A></h3>

The Solid State (SS) Laser uses a solid crystalline material as the lasing
medium and is usually optically pumped.  SS lasers should not be confused with
semiconductor or diode lasers which are also 'solid state' but are almost
always electrically pumped (though in principle, optical pumping may be
possible with some).  For information on these, see the chapter:
<A HREF="laserdio.htm#diotoc">Diode Lasers</A>.
<p>
The original laser invented in 1960 was a solid state laser.  It used a
synthetic ruby rod (chromium doped aluminum oxide) with mirrors on both ends
(one semitransparent) pumped with a helical xenon flashlamp surrounding the
rod.  The lamp was similar to what is used for indoor and high speed
photography.  The intense flash of blue-white light raised some of the chromium
atoms in the matrix (the aluminum oxide is just for structure and is inert as
far as the laser process is concerned) to an upper energy state from which
they could participate in stimulated emissions (see the chapter:
<A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqwil">What is a Laser and How Does It Work?</A> for a
brief explanation if this isn't familiar to you.  The result was an intense
pulse of coherent red light at 694.3 nm - the first ever laser light in the
world.  Gas and semiconductor lasers followed closely behind but only the
SS laser can claim to be first.
<p>
It was found early on that these lasers could burst balloons and blow holes in
razor blades and someone even attempted to coin a new measure of laser energy
to be measured in 'Gillettes' based on how many razor blades could be holed at
once. :)  And, the popular notion that hand-held death ray weapons would soon
follow are based on these sorts of demos of solid state lasers, not on whimpy
gas lasers (though the carbon dioxide laser is actually a much more likely
candidate being the classic heat-ray of science fiction)!
<p>
SS lasers are used in all sorts of applications including materials processing
(cutting, drilling, welding, marking, heat treating, etc.), semiconductor
fabrication (wafer cutting, IC trimming), the graphic arts (high-end printing
and copying), medical and surgical, rangefinders
and other types of measurement, scientific research, entertainment, and many
others where high peak power and/or high continuous power are required.  A
high energy pulsed YAG laser has even been used in rocket propulsion
experiments (well, at least to send an ounce or so aluminum projectile
a few feet into the air using just the pressure of photons!).  The largest
lasers (with the highest peak power) in the World are solid state lasers.
Many of the laser projectors for light shows and for other laser displays
use solid state rather than gas lasers like argon or krypton ion.  And,
that green laser pointer is a Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) laser.

<h3><A NAME="sslcts">Common Types</A></h3>

Modern solid state lasers are not all that much different from that original
prototype. However, while ruby crystals have and continue to have their place,
the majority of modern solid state lasers use neodymium (Nd) doped materials
such as Nd:YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet which is
Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>), Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, Nd:Glass, and
others.  These have a much lower lasing threshold than ruby as well as other
desirable physical and optical properties.  The strongest output wavelength
of neodymium doped lasers is around 1,064 nm - near-IR and totally invisible.
<p>
The exact wavelength of the strongest lasing lines depends on the actual host
material but usually doesn't vary that much.  In addition to Nd:YAG and
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> at 1,064 nm, examples that lase at slightly shorter
wavelengths include Nd:LSB at 1,062 nm, Nd:Glass at 1,060 nm and Nd:YLF
at 1,053 nm.  However, the lasing wavelengths of some like
Nd:LiNbO<sub>3</sub> (niodymium doped lithium niobate, 1,084 nm and 1,092 nm)
are longer and further away.
<p>
Other materials include holmium doped YAG (Ho:YAG) or Ho:YLF.  These lase
at around 2,060 and 2,100 nm respectively.  In the fiberoptic arena, erbium
doped glass (Er:Glass) may be used in optical repeaters and amplifiers at
around 1,540 nm.  Er:YAG lases at 2,840 nm.
<p>
Beyond these, there are not that many examples of widely used commercial solid
state lasers though many other materials are capable of the population
inversion needed for laser action.  The workhorse by far is still Nd:YAG
with Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> becoming increasingly important for low to medium
power (up to a few watts) 1,064 nm and frequency doubled 532 nm (green)
diode pumped solid state lasers.

<h3><A NAME="sslpop">Power Output - Pulsed and CW</A></h3>

Solid state lasers can be pulsed, CW (Continuous Wave), or quasi-CW.
<ul>
<li>Pulsed SS lasers generally use various versions of xenon flashlamps like
 the original ruby laser.  Q-switching is used to stabilize and boost peak
 power output by preventing the laser cavity from resonating (e.g., one of the
 mirrors is blocked or forced to be misaligned) until the population inversion
 has built up fully.
<p>
 Energy output is measured in joules (Watt-seconds) per pulse.  Multiply this
 by the number of pulses/second to calculate average power output.  To
 determine the peak power in each pulse requires a knowledge of the pulse
 shape.
<p>
 Flashlamp pumped SS lasers are used where high peak power is required as
 most other pumping methods can't even come close.  However, the average
 power and efficiency may be quite low compared to approaches using high
 power laser diode pumping (see below).
<p>
<li>CW SS lasers may use xenon or krypton arc lamps or other sources of
 intense broad spectrum light.  However, the trend today is toward the use of
 arrays of high power laser diodes to do the pumping.  These can be designed
 to have a wavelength that matches an absorption band in neodymium (around 800
 nm) making for very efficient excitation.  The diode pumped approaches are
 rapidly taking over due to their efficiency, resulting lower power
 consumption and heat dissipation, much more compact size, as well as much
 higher reliability and lower (virtually no) maintenance.  In fact, the
 relatively common, but still expensive green laser pointers currently
 available (prior to the introduction of direct injection green laser diodes)
 are diode pumped SS lasers with a frequency doubler as part of the laser
 cavity.  More on that later.
<p>
 Power output is measured the same way as for other CW lasers.
<p>
<li>Quasi-CW SS lasers are actually pulsed lasers but operating with a Pulse
 Repetition Rate (PRR) high enough to appear (for the intended application)
 to be continuous.  Generally, this means a PRR of at least 50 pps but may
 be 10s or 100s of kHz if electro-optically Q-switched.
<p>
 Depending on the application, the average power output or peak pulse energy
 or power may be the relevant measurement of performance.
<p>
 Note that while this output if frequency doubled to 532 nm (green) would
 appear CW to the human eye, it would NOT be suitable for laser TV or light
 show scanning since it really isn't continuous.
</ul>

Note that while the <i>peak</i> power of the output pulses for a Q-switched
laser may be many orders of magnitude greater than with the Q-switch disabled
or bypassed, for the fundamental output wavelength (e.g., 1,064 nm for a Nd:YAG
laser), the <i>total</i> energy (pulsed) or <i>average</i> power (quasi-CW) is
generally lower.  However, when frequency multiplication is used (e.g., 532 nm
green from a Nd:YAG laser), total energy or average power may actually be
greater with the Q-switch because frequency multiplication is a non-linear
process and is much more efficient as the peak power increases.  Depending on
the application, the high peak power may more than offset the lower total
energy or average power or vice-versa.

<h3><A NAME="ssleff">Efficiency of Solid State Lasers</A></h3>

Wall plug efficiency can vary from well under 1 percent for flashlamp and
arc lamp pumped SS lasers to 25 percent or more for those pumped with laser
diode pumped.
<p>
(From: Anonymous (localnet1@yahoo.com).)
<p>
A (laser) diode pumped Nd:YAG may have a 40% efficiency (operating multimode
with good thermal control of the diodes), and the pump diodes themselves have
about a 45% efficiency, resulting in a net 18% of efficiency from electrical
power to the diodes to output beam power.  However, at increased pump powers,
thermal issues may cause the efficiency to decrease after a certain point. This
decrease is power dependent, as well as resonator and pump assembly design
dependent.

<h3><A NAME="sslmtm">Miniature to Monster</A></h3>

Solid state lasers can range in size from something that could be built into
a pistol shaped enclosure to fire a bug zapping laser pulse (a fraction of a
joule every few seconds) or the laser pointer mentioned above, to a football
STADIUM sized monster.  The
<A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/">National Ignition Facility</A>
is a solid state laser/amplifier array comprising over 7,000 optical elements,
some more than a meter across, and producing megajoule pulses to be used for
inertial confinement fusion research and nuclear bomb physics simulation.  (So
they say - actually we all know that the laser engineers just want to be able
to play with a very large toy! :)
<p>
Unlike HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers, there is little standardization of solid
state laser components.  Laser rods come in all shapes and sizes - some not
even rod-shaped :) with or without mirrors (for use with external mirrors and
Q-switch optics).  They are also relatively expensive as despite their
deceptively simple appearance - partly due to the fact that they are a lot
fewer of them than laser diodes or HeNe tubes.  A price of $300 for a 75 x 5
mm Nd:YAG rod could be a bargain.
<p>
The most common type of solid state lasers to have shown up on the surplus
market are the laser head assemblies and pulse forming networks from some
versions of the M-60 and M-1 tank rangefinders.  Yes, if you come across a
blown up M-60 or M-1 battle tank in your local junk yard, there may be a
laser in there you can salvage!  But don't worry, most of the time, you
just have to take the laser. :)
<p>
<ul>
<li>The M-60 ruby laser has appeared in many surplus catalogs and their
 corresponding Web sites for prices ranging from about $50 to $300.  It
 includes the ruby rod and flashlamp, mechanical Q-switch mirror and motor,
 energy storage capacitor/pulse forming network and trigger for the flashlamp,
 and machined housing including cavity optics.  All one needed to
 do was connect it to a capacitor charging power supply (a few disposable
 camera flash inverters in series would probably even work) and provide a
 means of powering the Q-switch motor and triggering the flashlamp synchronized
 with the delayed pulse from a position sensor on the motor shaft.  Some people
 replaced the ruby rod with a Nd:YAG rod for higher output.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclhrl">Hughes Rangefinder Ruby Laser Assembly</A>.
<p>
<li>The M-1 Nd:YAG laser has appeared more recently from Meredith Instruments
 and elsewhere for $150 to $300.  It includes the rod, flashlamp, and mirrors,
 in a compact premanently aligned cavity assembly.  A compatible pulse forming
 network is also available.  All that is needed is a capacitor charging power
 supply and external trigger circuit.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclsy1">A Small Nd:YAG Laser - SSY1</A>.
</ul>
<p>
In fact, building a solid state laser if you have a Nd:YAG rod with integral
mirrors in-hand is very easy - just add a linear flashlamp of with enough
energy in close proximity wrapped in degreased aluminum foil!  For small rods,
a single-use (disposable) pocket camera flash will even work.  See the paper:
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lr/">Micro-Laser Range Finder
Development: Using the Monolithic Approach</A>.
<p>
My first contact with lasers was in the late 1960s when I inherited a student
built ruby laser based on a design from Popular Science magazine archived on
the Modern Mechanics blog Web site at <A HREF=
"http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/05/01/build-your-own-laser">Popular
Science: PS Builds a Laser and so can you</A>.  This used a
ruby rod with integral dielectric mirrors about 1/4" x 3" (this is all from
memory) and a linear flashlamp with an energy input of up to 400 W-s.
Regrettably, I don't know if it ever worked - the lamp fired fine but I was
too chicken to turn the capacitor voltage up to its maximum setting for fear
of blowing up the flashlamp!  Oh well. :(  At least, shortly after that, our
high school acquired a *real* 1 mW HeNe laser so I played with that some and
used it to view the hologram that was part of an issue of, I believe,
Scientific American.  Not the same as exploding balloons or drilling holes in
razor blades, however. :(
<p>
The <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> has many
detailed views of various solid state lasers from the M-60 Tank rangefinder to
a high power arc lamp powered system putting out over 100 W CW.

<h3><A NAME="sslmdpl">Microchip Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers</A></h3>

While what comes to mind when the term "solid state laser" is mentioned
will likely be that of a ruby or YAG rod pumped by a linear or helical
lamp, modern CW lasers are more likely to be diode pumped (see the sections
starting with: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped Solid State
Lasers</A>) and small to medium power ones will use a small piece of Nd:YAG
or Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> as the lasing medium.  For example,
<A HREF="dpss1.gif">Organization of Basic Green DPSS Lasers</A> shows the
major components of typical green laser pointers and a 100 mW green DPSS
laser.  Both of these use a chip of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (abbreviated as
vanadate) to produce the 1,064 nm IR intracavity beam which is frequency
doubled generating green light at 532 nm.
<p>
<ul>
<li>For the green laser pointer, the vanadate is typically about 0.5 x 2 x 2
 mm and the actual active portion is probably less than 0.5 mm long x 0.1 mm in
 diameter as determined by the lasing mode volume and the pump beam waist.
<p>
<li>For the 100 mW green laser, the vanadate is typically about 1.2 x 3 x 3 mm
 around 1.2 mm long x 0.15 mm in diameter active.
<p>
<li>For a 2 W green DPSS laser (not shown), the vanadate may be 3 x 3 x 3 mm
 with 3 mm long x 0.3 mm diameter active.
</ul>
<p>
Some people may only the first one to be a true microchip laser due to the
small size of the lasing crystal but I include the other two since their
designs are similar.  However, in all cases, the only reason the lasing chip
is so large in comparison to the active volume is due to manufacturing,
handling, mounting, and thermal considerations.  Thus, in principle, for the
100 mW green laser, a microrod say 1.2 mm long x 0.2 mm in diameter would be
all that is actually required.  But until laser chips are fabricated like
computer chips and a way is found to get rid of the waste heat, much more
material must be used.  And, it is the thermal problems that ultimately limit
performance - these tiny bits of lasing crystal are potentially capable of
much more power output than can be obtained without them being damaged from
heating.  The smallest mass produced microchip laser crystals I know of are
the CASIX DPM0101 hybrid vanadate-KTP module used in some green laser
pointers: 1x1x2.5 mm.  With cooling on all 4 sides, these may be capable
of more than the small number of mW required for a pointer.  The larger
DPM0102 can generate over 50 mW intermittently at least (but the glue used
to cement the two crystals may be damaged by the high intensity green light
after awhile).
<p>
Melles Griot's low to medium power high quality green DPSS lasers now use
composite crystals similar to CASIX's but of their own design optically
contacted, not glued, so there is no problem with high intracavity flux.
They use optics to shape the pump beam and active TEC cooling so these are
much better than laser pointers (and of course cost a lot more as well!).
I was told that the cavity is something like 1.5 mm in length (unconfirmed) so
this is even shorter than the DPM0101 but it probably has a cross-section more
than 1x1 mm.  The models currently available produce up to 20 mW but they have
gone much higher in the lab.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclmggcs">The Melles Griot 58 GCS Series Green DPSS
Laser</A> for more info.
<p>
Unlike lamp pumped rod based side-pumped SS lasers which may use much of the
volume of the laser rod, end-pumped DPSS lasers typically shape and focus the
diode pump beam to a very narrow waist to boost the power density in the
lasing crystal and to match the TEM00 mode volume of the cavity.  This is
an extremely efficient process compared to that of a lamp pumped laser.
The typical conversion from diode pump light to IR laser output is over
33%.  Compare this to a typical efficiency of 1% for a lamp pumped YAG laser.
A DPSS laser may have a better than 10% wall plug efficiency for IR and
frequency doubling efficiency (from 1,064 nm IR to 532 nm green) may exceed
50 percent.
<p>
Since microchip lasers can use so little actual lasing material and the pump
diodes are also very small, they can be very compact, and potentially mass
produced and inexpensive.  In addition to green laser pointers and low to
medium power DPSS IR and green lasers based on YAG or vanadate, all sorts of
other SS lasing materials can be used.  Of particular interest for
communications are erbium (Er) doped materials which lase around 1,530 nm,
a wavelength which is optimal for fiber-optic cable.
<p>
Microchip lasers also don't necessarily need high pump power.  Depending on
type, cavity design, and pump beam shape, a few mW of pump beam may be enough
to exceed the lasing threshold and they have very high slope efficiency
(percent increase in laser output versus increase in pump input) as well.

<h3><A NAME="sslmax">What Ultimately Limits Output from SS Laser</A></h3>

While much greater energy or power can generally be obtained from a given
volume of a solid state lasing medium compared to a gas laser, it isn't
unlimited.  The same sorts of effects come into play as pump input is
increased.  Beyond a certain point, even with everything optimal, all that
will happen is that your electrical and cooling bills will go up - assuming
laser survives!  The lasing medium will be doing as much as it can.
<p>
(From: Doug Little (dmlittle@btinternet.com).)
<p>
Like other lasing mediums, the output power from a YAG, ruby, or
similar solid state rod will rise according to pump energy - but only up
to the point where the active lasing medium is saturated (i.e. all the
dopant ions are raised to the upper state). Beyond this point, no amount
of extra pump energy will make any difference beyond generating unwanted
waste heat.  Also, a low-% doped crystal will reach this state more quickly,
and will have a longer fluorescence period because the laser 'chain
reaction' is inhibited by a reduced population of contributing ions -
something like sticking carbon rods in a nuclear reactor to slow it down
(well, that's how I like to think of it but feel free to flame, grill, or
laser zap me if you think it's a bad analogy :-)
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Actually, I think it is an excellent analogy.  Just think of all those mouse
traps in the upper energy state! :)
<p>
(From: Doug.)
<p>
The saturation thing is a fairly obvious point, but it would be unfortunate to
see enthusiasts building some huge 6-lamp device with a tiny pink ruby rod to
find that they get the same output as they could achieve with 2 or 3 lamps! :-)
<p>
It would also be nice to have a good clear explanation of doping percent
differences and what effect this typically has on laser action. It can make a
big difference when you are designing a laser that will work properly even with
reasonably well known pump energies.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, the last item would be nice.  Are you volunteering? :)  However,
realistically, where the laser rod is surplus, there probably isn't any
easy way to determine the doping percent or control it!
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
There are all sorts of things that limit the amount of output energy or power
from a given size crystal including: damage threshold of the laser medium,
energy storage capacity of the laser medium, thermal considerations, and
optical considerations (such as self focusing and thermal lensing).  You can
scale any laser, but there comes a point where you have to make the laser
bigger to get more energy.  Look at the NOVA laser at Lawrence Livermore
National Labs: The light starts out in a small laser rod that could be placed
in the palm of your hand, then it gets amplified in a chain of laser amplifiers
that take up the area of a football <b>STADIUM</b>!

<h3><A NAME="sslsss">Solid State Laser Safety</A></h3>

In addition to general laser safety issues (see the chapter:
<A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser Safety</A>), solid state lasers present
a number of unique - and potentially very serious safety risks - of their own:
<p>
<ul>
<li>With pulsed lasers, there is no benefit from a blink or aversion reflex.
 If you take a hit in the eye from a laser pulse of sufficient energy (less if
 it is relatively well collimated), there WILL be retinal damage and such
 damage will be permanent.  It doesn't take much - a small fraction of a joule
 at a non-eye-safe wavelength (say between UV and 1.5 um IR).  Since this range
 includes the most common 1064 nm Nd:YAG and 694.3 nm ruby wavelengths, almost
 any of the lasers you are likely to be working with have the potential for
 permanent vision damage or loss.  Small holes punched in your retina will not
 likely be immediately detected or felt.  However, over time your visual field
 will tend toward the appearance of a shot-gun blasted target if proper
 precautions to avoid exposure are not taken.
<p>
<li>The Nd:YAG (and other neodymium doped materials) wavelength of 1064 nm is
 in the IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum and totally invisible.
 Thus, there is no way to even avoid a CW beam!  The ruby wavelength of 694.3
 nm appears less than 1/160th as bright as 555 nm green or 1/40th as bright as
 a HeNe laser at 632.8 nm!  Furthermore, being most likely a short pulse, its
 brightness is further reduced.  Thus, you can't base pulsed solid state laser
 power on any CW laser with which you are familiar.
<p>
<li>Many of these lasers produce high energy pulses - large enough to burn or
 damage things including flesh.  Except for the lowest energy SS lasers, treat
 these as you would a loaded gun.  While a 1 joule laser pulse isn't going to
 do major damage (unless it is into your eye), you still don't want to be on
 receiving end of one!  Reflected beams can be dangerous as well.
<p>
 (From: Ed Xavier Gonzalez (ohlaser@flash.net).)
<p>
<blockquote>
 "Short pulse YAGs can do considerable damage, and can possibly ignite
  insignificant metals without warning.  I have (on only one occasion)
  accidentally ignited some very fine stainless steel powder.  I thought
  that was impossible until I read the MSDS on some commercially available
  material.  Long pulse YAGs will burn very deeply and can do biological
  damage if not handled with respect (experience talking).  Typically, long
  pulse YAGs mark alumina ceramic and stainless very well without removing
  much material.  The short pulse YAGs will definitely remove material, but
  have a tendency to ablate rather than mark."
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>The light output of the xenon flashlamp or arc lamp is extremely intense
 and contains significant UV.  This is both dangerous to vision and flesh as
 well has having the significant potential to set things on fire.  The output
 of the xenon lamp from a typical solid state laser is 100 times or more that
 of a pocket camera flash.  While the laser head usually is nearly or fully
 enclosed during operation, don't be tempted to test one with its covers
 removed unless you take appropriate precautions.
<p>
<li>THE POWER SUPPLIES ARE UNIVERSALLY LETHAL!  Even the smallest solid state
 laser uses energy storage capacitors that can kill.  This includes those
 disposable camera flash units as well.  A 'small' ruby or Nd:YAG laser likely
 uses something much larger - 400 joules from a capacitor bank of 200 uF at
 2,000 V!  This is similar in energy storage capacity to a that of atypical
 defibrillator - and those can be used to both restart a misbehaving heart as
 well as to stop a healthy one!
<p>
 The document: <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or
 Line Powered Equipment</A> should be thoroughly studied before even thinking
 about working on any of the power supplies for solid state lasers.  ALWAYS
 assume the capacitors are charged - never assume they are safe to touch even
 if the laser has been left unplugged for weeks!
<p>
 More information on the specific electrical dangers are outlined below.
</ul>
<p>
There are several potential hazards in dealing with the innards of electronic
flash, solid state laser power supplies, and other xenon strobe equipment.
<p>
<ol>
<li>The energy storage capacitor.  Even on small pocket camera electronic
 flash units, these are rated at 100 to 400 uF at 330 VDC.  This is 5 to 20
 W-s which is enough to kill you under the right (wrong?) conditions.
 The xenon flashlamp power supplies in solid state lasers (often innocently
 called the 'pulse forming networks') may use capacitors that have a 10
 times or higher uF rating and a 10 times or higher voltage rating.  A
 'medium size' SS laser might use 1,100 uF at 3,000 VDC - that's about 4,900
 joules.  The energy in that capacitor bank is enough to instantly kill 80
 adult humans based on a 60 J/person fatality threshold.  You don't get a
 second chance at these energies and voltages - arm-to-arm contact across
 such a capacitor bank WILL be fatal - touch one of these and you will be
 but a puff of vapor in the wind...
<p>
 High voltage with high energy storage is an instantly deadly combination.
 Treat all of these capacitors - even those in tiny pocket cameras with the
 same respect as a loaded gun or stick of dynamite.  Always confirm that they
 are fully discharged before even thinking about touching anything.  On
 larger systems especially, install a shorting jumper after discharging just
 to be sure - these types of capacitors commonly recover a portion of their
 original charge without additional power input.  In the case of an SS laser
 capacitor bank, it doesn't take a very large portion to be fatal.  Better
 to kill the power supply than yourself if you forget to remove the shorting
 bar when powering up the unit.
<p>
<li>Systems that are line connected (no power transformer) have all the
 dangers associated with AC line power in addition to the large power supply
 and energy storage capacitors.  More modern SS laser capacitor charging
 supplies are likely line connected high voltage inverters.  Always use an
 isolation transformer when probing line connected systems.  However, keep
 in mind that the power supply filter capacitors and energy storage capacitors
 remain just as deadly.
<p>
<li>Systems using power transformers such as neon sign or oil burner ignition
 types (as is likely with a home-built design) still have the danger of the
 raw high voltage AC being enough to kill.  With the centertap of these
 transformers usually being grounded to the case, an isolation transformer,
 even if you have one that is big enough - may not be of much value.
</ol>

 light, ultraviolet radiation, heat and fire hazards, and other hazards
 related to xenon flash systems is available from Don's

 Hints</a> page.
<p>
<li>Again, see the document: <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High
 Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment</A>.  Study it forwards and backwards
 and follow it!  To repeat one statement: NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING!

Reading and following these recommendations and heeding the warnings is
especially important when working with high power solid state laser power
supplies or xenon strobes of any kind.

<h3><A NAME="sslcss">Comments on Surplus Solid State Lasers and
 Components</A></h3>

The people who run some of the surplus outfits (on the Internet and elsewhere)
are not necessarily knowledgeable enough about solid state (or other) laser
technology to know exactly what they are selling.  Some unscrupulous
individuals may even consider it good business practice to offer junk at
inflated prices with the expectation that when the completed laser doesn't
operate as advertised, the buyer will assume it is due to a failure on their
part (the buyer's) to assemble it correctly.  The seller will, of course,
claim that it had been tested before shipping - which is often a total load of
something that smells bad. :)  Not all the suppliers listed in the chapter:
<A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A> are equally
reputable.  I have attempted to identify the few that are particularly slimy
but am unable to be as pointed as I would like since my information is limited
and not from direct personal experience.
<p>
For solid state lasers provided as kits of parts (which is probably the most
common for types like Nd:YAG or ruby other than the M-60 rangefinder), be
aware that the only type that can likely be made to work easily are those
that are flashlamp pumped unless you have access to high power laser diodes
of the proper wavelength.  The rod must be optically polished and coated
(HR, OC, or AR as appropriate) - you won't do that in your basement.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strgpr">Grinding and Polishing a Ruby Rod</A>.
<p>
Using broad band sources like halogen lamps or the Sun for pumping is
extremely difficult due to the limited range of wavelengths that matches the
lasing medium's absorption spectrum and the huge amount of waste heat.  And,
any claims about CW operation for some of these are often totally bogus as the
physics simply prohibits it.
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
Commercial laser rods are typically finished with the following
specifications: Ends flat to l/10 wavelength, ends parallel to Å± 4 arc
seconds, perpendicularity to the rod axis to Å± 5 minutes, rod axis
parallel to within Å± 5Å∫ to [111] direction. These tolerances cannot
readably be achieved by the home experimenter. All commercial laser rods also
have anti-reflection coatings applied to their ends which must also be done
professionally.  If the mirrors aren't included or part of the rod itself,
they will have to be purchased separately.
<p>
The CW pumping of ruby is not impossible but nearly so, with terrible
efficiencies. The pumping of ruby or Ti:sapphire to threshold is literally
impossible using tungsten-halogen lamps as has been suggested by some
uninformed individuals. Ruby's main absorption bands are located at 404 nm
and 554 nm and Ti:sapphire's peaks at about 490 nm. Tungsten-halogen lamps
have an emission maximum at 840 nm which is very far from the either of
these crystal's absorption bands. Radiation output at the blue and green
wavelengths is very poor in these types of lamps, hence another major problem.
<p>
Finally, ruby has a very high excitation threshold, being a three-level
system, despite its fairly long fluorescence lifetime of 3 ms (at 300K). In
early experimental tests, a very small ruby rod (2 mm diameter x 50 mm
length) was pumped by special capillary mercury arc lamps (good spectral
match) and it took an input of 2.9 kW to produce a CW output of 1.3 watts.
Only a small portion of the ruby was excited by the filament arc and laser
action only occurred in 6 x 10<sup>-3</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>. Using this data,
the lamp input power per unit volume of active material to obtain threshold
is about 230 kW per cubic centimeter.

<h2>Basic Structure of Solid State Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sslcav">Cavity Components</A></h3>

Like most other types of lasers, the heart of the solid state laser is the
laser cavity or resonator.  In the following sections, we deal with the
traditional direct output solid state laser.  Frequency multipliers, OPOs, and
other variations and enhancements will be covered later.
<p>
The basic structure of the SS Laser hasn't changed in any fundamental way
since its invention in 1960.  A transparent rod (most common shape) doped
with a small amount of impurity (the actual lasing medium) is optically pumped
by a light source (most commonly one or more linear xenon flashlamps or an
array of high power laser diodes) whose spectrum contains significant energy
at wavelengths matching one or more of the absorption lines of the lasing
medium.  One or both mirrors are either an integral part of the laser rod or
external.  A Q-switch device is often included to compress and boost the
energy in the output pulse (pulsed or quasi-pulsed lasers only) with some
loss in total energy or average power at the fundamental wavelength.
Additional devices such as an intra-cavity frequency harmonic generation
crystal (most commonly, doubling - second harmonic generation or SRG) or
external Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) may be added.  Total output
energy or average power may actually increase compared to CW operation due
to the non-linear behavior of these processes.
<p>
Properly selecting the cavity components and driving the pump source properly
can make all the difference in terms of output pulse energy, beam quality, and
stability.

<h3><A NAME="sslpsu">Power Sources</A></h3>

Unlike gas or semiconductor lasers, most of which employ direct electrical
excitation, the power supply for the optically pumped SS laser drives the
light source - be it a xenon flashlamp, arc lamp, array of high power laser
diodes.  Thus, it isn't directly associated with the lasing medium as with
those other types of lasers.  Optical pump sources include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Xenon flashlamp - Like a photographic electronic flash or party strobe,
 a capacitor bank provides the energy.  For pulsed lasers, these capacitors may
 be HUGE (and equally LETHAL).  A medium size SS laser rod may require 1,000 J
 at 2,000 V (about 10 times more energy than a professional photographic
 'speed light'.)  Additional components (at least an inductor) shape the pulse
 to the flashlamp to provide a specific pulse duration and maximize power
 transfer without undershoot.  This combination of energy storage capacitor
 bank and associated components is usually called the "Pulse Forming Network"
 or PFN.  In addition, a trigger device is needed to fire the flashlamp.  This
 may be attached to an external electrode or be wired in series with the anode
 lead of the flashlamp.  A "Capacitor Charging Unit" provides the power to
 charge the capacitor to the desired voltage.  These are rated in power output
 or joules/second which determines (in conjunction with the limits of the
 flashlamp/cooling) how fast the laser can be pulsed - but doesn't affect the
 actual pulse output in any way.
<p>
 Matching the PFN to the flashlamp, rod material, and cavity optics is
 critical in achieving efficient (as these things go) pumping of the laser.
 For example, just one parameter - the flashlamp pulse duration - can easily
 determine whether a modest input energy will result in an output beam,
 whether 10 times this energy will be needed, or whether it the laser will do
 anything at all.  For a given total pulse energy, if the pulse duration is
 too long, lasing will be erratic or non-existent.  Normally, it should be
 designed to be shorter than the fluorescence lifetime of the lasing medium.
 As the pulse becomes shorter and shorter, the peak output power and pulse
 consistency will approach that of a Q-switched laser.  However, designing
 a PFN for a very short pulse is difficult and expensive, and the flashlamp
 must be derated and its life reduced for very short pulses.  Thus, practical
 direct drive schemes can never compete with Q-switching.  The PFN for a
 typical non-Q-switched Nd:YAG laser will produce a 100 to 200 us pulse which
 is well matched to the Nd:YAG's 230 us fluorescence lifetime but will result
 in a series of variable size pulses rather than a single short large one.
<p>
 See the chapter: <A HREF="lasersps.htm#spstoc">SS Laser Power Supplies</A>
 for more information.
<p>
<li>Xenon, krypton, or other arc lamp - For CW operation, a continuous arc
 lamp is one option.  These are high power (often 10s of kW), water or oil
 cooled units requiring 10s of AMPS or more through their discharge.  Power
 supplies are similar in basic design to those for ion lasers.
<p>
<li>High power laser diodes or arrays of laser diodes - Within the last 10
 years, these have largely displaced arc lamps for most new CW SS lasers.
 A major reason is that the wall plug efficiency of a diode pumped laser can
 be many many times better than for an arc lamp pumped laser since the
 wavelength of the laser diode and absorption band of the solid state lasing
 medium can be matched resulting in a transfer efficiency exceeding 50 percent.
 The cost of high power laser diodes has been falling steadily (a 1 W bare
 laser diode is in the $10 range) and <i>their</i> efficiency is also quite
 high (probably comparable to that of the arc lamp but at precisely the
 required wavelength).  The drivers for these laser diodes and arrays are
 sophisticated current controlled power supplies often in conjunction with
 active (Peltier) cooling and optical feedback power monitoring.
<p>
<li>Halogen lamps or the Sun - A very few commercial SS lasers have used
 common halogen lamps (and lots of cooling!) for pumping and even the Sun and
 chemical reactions which produce light have been used in the laboratory but
 these are extremely inefficient.

<h2>The Solid State Laser Medium</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sslsas">Shapes and Sizes</A></h3>

The actual lasing medium for solid state lasers are the atoms of the dopant
in a transparent crystalline or amorphous (glass) host material.  Physically,
this can be in the shape of a small block, a rod, a slab, or something else.
For the smallest diode pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers - those which are
part of a 3 mW green laser pointer or 20 mW laser module, a tiny block is all
that is needed - perhaps 2 x 2 x 1 mm.  However, the most common shape
by far is the laser rod - typically 25 to 300 mm or more in length, and 3 mm
to 25 mm or more in diameter.  Output pulse energies from these range from a
few millijoules (mJ) to many Js per pulse or into the 100s of watts if CW or
quasi-CW.  Very large lasers may use slabs up to a meter across - usually as
laser amplifiers rather than sources without outputs in the kJ or TeraWatt
range!  There is also growing interest in the use of thin disks for
the lasing medium since this shape provides some significant advantages.
At the other extreme, the lasing medium may be the core of a doped optical
fiber 10s or 100s of meters in length.
<p>
However, most of our attention will be devoted to the common rod shape for
lamp pumped solid state lasers and "microchips" for diode pumped solid state
lasers.

<h3><A NAME="ssllrr">Laser Materials - Ruby, Nd:YAG, Nd:YVO4, Nd:Glass</A></h3>

The heart of any laser is the actual lasing medium which in the case of a solid
state laser, is, well, a solid. :)  Most of these consist of a crystalline
host doped with the actual active lasing atoms or ions.  Less common is
an amorphous (glass) host.  Recent developments in ceramic fabrication
techniques promises to greatly expand the availability of low cost high
quality lasing materials in much larger sizes than possible with crystals.
The most common by far to date have been:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby - Chromium doped aluminum oxide (Cr:Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
 Synthetic ruby is chemically similar to gem stone ruby but of higher purity
 and quality.  It is pinkish in appearance with a lasing wavelength is 694.3
 nm.  The beam is very deep red at the border of IR and appears only about
 160th as bright as the most visible 555 nm green wavelength to the human eye.
<p>
<li>Nd:YAG - Neodymium doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet
 (Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>).  Another synthetic crystal.  It
 is purplish/lavender in appearance and lases at 1,064 nm.  This is near-IR
 but totally invisible and NOT eye-safe.  Nd:YAG has been by far the most
 common solid state laser material - much more so than ruby - partly because
 its lasing threshold is much lower so more output energy is available for a
 given input.
<p>
<li>Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (Neodymium-doped Yttrium orthoVanadate) - This crystal,
 often just called "vanadate", is the material of choice in low to medium
 power (up to a few watts) diode pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers operating
 at 1,064 and 1,340 nm (or doubled to 532 and 670 nm) due to its large
 stimulated emission cross-section, low lasing threshold, and polarized
 output.  See the additional comments in the next section.
<p>
<li>Nd:GdVO<sub>4</sub> (Neodymium-doped Gadolinium orthoVanadate) - This is
 a relatively new material with absorption and emission wavelegnths similar to
 Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> but with thermal properties similar to Nd:YAG.
<p>
<li>Nd:Gd<sub>0.64</sub>Y<sub>0.36</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> - Another even newer
 material which in addition to the benefits of both Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> and
 Nd:GdVO<sub>4</sub>, has superior energy (upper level) storage, can be
 pumped more efficiently in a quasi three level mode at 879 nm (in addition
 to 808 nm), and may be  manufactured by the much simpler floating zone
 method rather than the Czochralski crystal pulling technique.
<p>
<li>Nd:Glass - Instead of a crystal, an amorphous glass is used as the
 substrate.  I haven't heard much about this recently other than its use
 for the NOVA and NIF lasers at Lawrence Livermore National Labs.  Its lasing
 characteristics are similar to Nd:YAG but since glass has a lower thermal
 conductivity, cooling becomes a problem for high power applications.
 The main reason Nd:Glass is used for these lasers is that it is the lasing
 medium that can be manufactured in sizes larger than a foot in diameter (as
 required to keep the fluence - energy density - within acceptable limits to
 avoid damage to the optics in these multi-kilojoule pulsed lasers).  Not to
 mention that it is also less expensive - which may or may not matter with
 these projects. :)  So, where thousands of large diameter optics are needed
 and a dozen shots a day is adequate performance as with the lasers at LLNL,
 Nd:Glass is the way to go.  Someone was recently selling various large
 Nd:Glass rods and slabs that must have come from one of these sources!
</ul>
<p>
Other important solid state lasing materials include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Erbium doped - Er:YAG (2,940 nm) and Er:Glass (1,540 nm).
<li>Holmium doped - Ho:YAG, Ho:YLF, and Ho:Glass (2,000 to 2,100 nm).
<li>Thulium doped - Tm:YAG, Tm:LuAG, Tm,Ho:YLF (2,000 to 2,030 nm).
<li>Ytterbium doped - Yb:KGW (1,025 to 1,045 nm).
<li>Alexandrite (655 to 815 nm).
<li>Ti:Sapphire (840 to 1,100 nm).

<p>
Straight out of my text-book (1975 and first edition):
 <p>
 <blockquote>
 "Glass laser hosts are optically isotropic and easy to fabricate,
  posses excellent optical quality, and are hard enough to accept and
  retain optical finishes. In most cases glasses may be more heavily and
  more homogeneously doped than crystals, and in general, glasses posses
  broader absorption bands and exhibit longer fluorescence decay
  times. The primary disadvantage of glass are its broad fluorescence
  line widths (leading to higher thresholds), its significantly lower
  thermal conductivity (a factor of 10, leading to thermally induced
  birefringence and distortion when operated at high pulse repetition
  rates or high average powers), and its susceptibility to solarization
  (darkening due to color centers which are formed in the glass as a
  result of the UV radiation from the flashlamps). These disadvantages
  limit the use of glass laser rod for CW and high-repetition rate
  lasers."

<h3><A NAME="sslclm">Comments on Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, and Nd:YVO4</A></h3>

(Portions from: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
<ul>
<li>Nd:YAG (Neodymium doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) has been used as a laser
 medium for many years since its first successful use in 1964. This material
 possesses good optical, thermal, and mechanical properties and is likely the
 most used solid-state laser material. It has a relatively low threshold and
 high efficiency. Its basic properties are: strongest transition at room
 temperature = 1.06414 um, gain bandwidth = 257 GHz, spontaneous fluorescence
 lifetime = 230 us, melting point = 1,970 &deg;C, change in line center of
 -1.4 GHz per &deg;C.  YAG is an extremely hard material and
 has good thermal conductivity.  The main absorption bands of Nd:YAG are
 located at 570 to 600 nm, 730 to 760 nm, 790 to 820 nm, and 860 to 890 nm.
 The lasing output of YAG is randomly polarized so the crystal must be cut at
 the Brewster angle or there must be some additional optics inside the cavity
 if a linearly polarized beam is required.
<p>
 Nd:YAG has been effectively pumped by various sources including flashlamps
 (xenon and krypton), krypton CW arc lamps, tungsten-halogen lamps, and high
 power laser diodes.  At current densities of lass than 4,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup>,
 both xenon and krypton have a good match with the absorption curve of Nd:YAG
 laser material.  Even some more exotic methods have been used, such as
 sun-pumped, flashbulb-pumped, and explosively-pumped. The availability of high
 quality surplus Nd:YAG rods at reasonable prices on the surplus market make
 this material very attractive to the home-experimenter.  Using one of these
 to make a flashlamp pumped pulsed laser is quite easy.
<p>
<li>Nd:YLF (Neodymium doped Yttrium Lithium Fluoride) has gained wide
 acceptance with a dramatic improvement in crystal quality over the last 12
 years. This material has advantages for diode pumping due to its long
 fluorescence lifetime (twice that of Nd:YAG) which allows for a greater energy
 storage from the same number of diodes. This material also exhibits two
 distinct output lines depending upon polarization. Transitions are at 1047 nm
 for the extraordinary and 1053 nm for the ordinary. This material also has a
 large thermal conductivity which allows for good heat extraction. If one were
 constructing a high-power diode-pumped system this would be a choice of
 material, although I'd imagine that this is still rather expensive.
<p>
<li>Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (Neodymium doped Yttrium orthoVanadate) is currently one
 of the most efficient laser crystal for diode laser-pumped solid-state lasers
 especially used in end-pumping configurations. The Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> crystal
 has large stimulated emission cross-sections at both 1,064 nm and 1,340 nm.
 The stimulated emission cross-section of an a-axis cut Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>
 crystal at 1.06 mm is about 4 times that of the Nd:YAG crystal.  Despite the
 short 95 us fluorescence lifetime of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (approximately 2.4
 times shorter than that of Nd:YAG) and larger optical losses, it exhibits a
 much lower laser threshold compared to a similar size Nd:YAG crystal.  This
 is due to the fact that the product of its lasing cross section and upper
 state lifetime is twice that of Nd:YAG.  Because of its high-pump quantum
 efficiency, the slope efficiency of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> can be very high if
 the laser cavity is properly designed. This laser crystal is finding much use
 in frequency doubled green laser pointers and other small diode laser modules.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="ssllsb">First Nd:YAG, Now Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, Next Nd:LSB</A></h3>

(From: Juozas Reksnys (rexnys@uj.pfi.lt).)
<p>
Nd:YAG, Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, and Nd:YLF are common in diode-pumped lasers.
But, the most effective is the newly developed laser crystal
Nd:LaSc<sub>3</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> or Nd:LSB. Nd:LSB has
has absorption and radiation cross section similar to Nd:YAG
but the bands are five time wider. The absorption coefficient of
Nd<sub>3</sub>+ (10%at) in LSB is three times higher than Nd:YAG. LSB can be
very heavily doped with Nd<sub>3</sub>+ (until 50%at), which provides record
efficiency in the end-pumped configuration.  This is a very high level in
comparison with YAG (1.2% before luminescence quenching) or YVO4 3%, and
1.5% YLF. Furthermore, the saturation intensity of Nd:LSB is five times bigger
than those of YAG or LSB.
<p>
For example, using a microchip 0.5 mm thick and 2 to 3 mm in diameter, is
is possible to obtain 0.5 to 50 mW of green output at 531 nm.  Q-switch mode
in such a microchip is possible with a Cr<sub>4</sub>+:YAG absorber.  On LSB
with KTP for SHG grown in Russia, BREMLAS is producing powerful green lasers
with cubic inch dimensions.  A 10 W green microlaser is under development.

<h3><A NAME="sslexa">Exact Wavelengths of Neodymium Lasers</A></h3>

The most common YAG and Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate) lasers are usually listed
as operating at 1,064 nm.  However, this is not totally accurate and their
wavelengths differ slightly.
<p>
The wavelength for vanadate is more precisely 1,064.3 nm.  There is also a
weaker line at 1,342 nm.
<p>
(Portions from: Juozas Reksnys (rexnys@uj.pfi.lt).)
<p>
This most powerful lasing Nd:YAG line is composed from two lines 1,064.17 nm
(strong line) and 1,064.4 (week line). At room temperature, the half-width of
lasing line is 6.5 cm<sup>-1</sup> which exceeds the distance
of 2 cm<sup>-1</sup> between two lines.  Therefore, they are a joint line.
<p>
The wavelength of this line depends on temperature. In the practical range of
+/-60 &deg;C, it linearly shifts to longer wavelengths during heating by
5x10<sup>-3</sup> nm/deg. At 27 &deg;C (300 &deg;K), the center of the
lasing line is at 1,064.15 nm.
<p>
In addition to the common 1,064 nm wavelength, Nd:YAG has over a dozen
other weaker lasing transitions between 1,052 nm and 1,444 nm.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
However, the vanadate and YAG wavelengths are close enough (0.15 nm) that a
lamp or diode pumped YAG crystal can be used as an amplifier for the output
of a vanadate laser in a (MOPA - Master Oscillator Power Amplifier)
configuration since the gain bandwidth of YAG is about 0.5 nm.

<h3><A NAME="sslckn">Comments on Nd:KGW and NYAB</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
KGW has a NICE broad absorption spectrum, that makes it a lot easier to work
with than YAG BUT its thermal properties are poor.
<p>
I have a paper titled "Generation of visible light with diode pumped
solid state lasers" by Boller/Bartschke/Knappe/Wallenstein from 1993 that was
published in "Solid State Lasers: New Developments and Applications" Edited by
M.Inguscio and R. Wallenstein, Plenum Press, New York, 1993.  This long paper
(17 pages) focuses on NYAB.  The authors state: "We report the so far highest
531 nm output power of 130 mW generated with 1.55 Watt of diode pumping."
<p>
(From: Milan Karakas (mkarakas@vk.tel.hr).)
<p>
I have a Nd:KGW rod 5 mm diameter x 50 mm long.   This is a neodymium doped
potassium-gadolinium tungstate single crystal.
This crystal has a Nd doping of 3% and operates at 1067.2 nm with 4 to 6%
efficiency (Q-switched, 6.3 mm x 75 mm at 50 Hz), 3% efficiency CW, and 60%
efficiency when diode pumped laser (quasi CW).  The lasing threshold is
extremely low - 0.2 - 1 J!  I have not found reasonably priced optics for
this laser (we may use optic for classic Nd:YAG, because wavelength is
close) and pump source with low thermal emission (808 nm laser or LED).
The rod was inexpensive - $209 USD including DHL shipping and duty.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
NYAB is a self-doubling (combined lasing and non-linear crystal) but it has
a much lower doubling efficiency than traditional vanadate/KTP or YAG/KTP.
The numbers I have seen are on the order of about 30 mW out for 1 W
of diode pumping (efficiency is much higher with Ti:Saph pumping, but it's
kind of inconvenient to have a such a laser pump a 100 mW 532 nm system, not to
mention expensive. :)
<p>
The following is from a 1990 paper so better performance is likely:
"Work on diode-pumped self-doubling lasers is still in the early phases of
development.  The most attractive nonlinear gain medium is Nd:YAB, which is a
dilute form of the stoichiometric neodymium compound neodymium aluminum borate
(NAB).  Diode-pumped Nd:YAB lasers with output powers in the milliwatt range
have been demonstrated (reference 10.67)"

<h3><A NAME="sslpvy">Power Output versus Wavelength for Vanadate and
 YAG</A></h3>

The absorption curve of Nd:YVO4 (vanadate) is quite broad compared to Nd:YAG
(YAG).  The following is from a graph in "Solid State Laser Engineering" by
Koechner.  (This actually deals with output power, not absorption, but since
that is the desired effect, the numbers should be similar):

<ul>
<li>Nd:YVO4: Between 806 nm and beyond 813 nm, the output power is
 approximately constant.  The corresponds to a temperature range of 20 &deg;C
 for the pump diode.  The output drops to 50 percent at about 801 nm.  (The
 graph doesn't go higher than 813 nm.)
<p>
<li>Nd:YAG: The peak is between 809 and 810 nm with the output power down
 by 40 percent at 807 and 810 nm.
</ul>

For pumping with diodes, the wider wavelength range of vanadate is very
significant because temperature tuning is a lot less critical and for low
power DPSS lasers such as green laser pointers, thermal management isn't
essential (though some variation may still be evident).

<h3><A NAME="sslgls">Types of Nd:Glass</A></h3>

(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
There are slight variations in the peak wavelengths for different types of
Nd doped glasses. These differences are only very slight and should not be of
great concern. The following are some glass types and peak emission
wavelengths:

<ul>
<li>LG-670 (silicate): 1,061 nm.
<li>Q-246 (silicate): 1,062 nm.
<p>
<li>LG-760 (phosphate): 1,054 nm.
<li>LGH-5 (phosphate): 1,054 nm.
<li>Q-88 (phosphate): 1,054 nm.
</ul>

Only a few types of Nd:doped glass are commercially available. Most common are
silicates and phosphates.  Doping concentration varies from 0.5% to 6%.
Where the rods or slabs are from high energy fusion research I would assume
that they are probably a fluorphosphate type that tends to minimize nonlinear
effects, which becomes quite important in this particular application.

<h3><A NAME="sslrub">Manufacture of Synthetic Ruby Crystals</A></h3>

(From: Christopher R. Carlen (crobc@epix.net).)
<p>
Ruby rods for lasers are made synthetically.  Aluminum Oxide
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) with a very small amount of chromium impurity
is melted in an induction furnace.  A seed crystal (perhaps a natural ruby or
a chip off another synthetic crystal) is stuck into the melt on a rod then
slowly withdrawn.  A cylindrical rod of "ruby" crystal is formed and is slowly
pulled out of the melt.  This rod is then cut up and ground with diamond
machining equipment to form the precisely shaped laser rod.  The ends
are polished to extreme levels and then treated with whatever optical
coatings are desired, depending on the design of the laser (i.e., mirrors
directly on the rod or external).
<p>
(From: Mark W. Lund (mlund@moxtek.com).)
<p>
There are several ways to do this.  The first is the easiest, to pull from the
melt.  You can melt Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in molybdenum crucibles and
pull a crystal directly from the melt.  Even single crystal tubes and other
shapes having a fixed cross section can be pulled using a technique called
"edge defined growth."  Unfortunately, because of the incredible temperatures
that sapphire melts at any dopants that you might want to use vaporize, so you
can't make red or blue material, only water-white material.
<p>
If you want colored sapphire or ruby there are two more methods used.  The
first, Vernuile (sp?), uses a hydrogen-oxygen flame and drops powdered
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> plus dopant through the flame.  The flame melts
the powder, which falls on the seed crystal and crystalizes.  Because only
the surface of the crystal is molten the dopant gets incorporated into the
bulk.  The crystals are called boules, and look vaguely like a pop bottle,
with a small neck, opening up into a cylindrical crystal.  The stresses are so
enormous in these boules that when you snap the neck off the entire crystal
breaks into several pieces along the axis of the boule.  Most colored sapphire
and ruby sold is made this way, including the watch jewels.
<p>
The last method used commonly is flux growth.  The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
is dissolved in a molten salt, usually lead oxide plus cryolite, in a platinum
crucible.  The crystals come out of solution as the melt is cooled just like
sugar in hot water.  These are the most desirable of the synthetic stones
because they look more like natural stones after cutting, and the process is
the most expensive.
<p>
(From: Fred Perry.)
<p>
Actually, Union Carbide in Washougal Washington makes synthetic Ruby and other
colored variants of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (sapphire) by the Czochralski
method.  I bought an nice big CZ 'ruby' gemstone from UC at CLEO a few years
ago.  You are right that it is hard to get dopants to dissolve in the pot; but
this is more a limitation on max concentration and hence achieved depth of
color than something that can't be done at all.  UC in fact makes (sole
source - patented) the 'ruby' laser rods that were discussed in another post
this week.  They are pink, not red.
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
Hmm, whom am I going to believe, Fred, whom I have a lot of respect for,
or me, whom I have to live with?   CZ is usually the method of choice
if you can grow a crystal, but I have never seen a paper or patent on
CZ growth of colored sapphire.  I can't imagine going through all the
pain and cost of flux growth or Vernuile if you could pull it from the
melt.  The method of choice for lasers, by the way, was flux growth
when I last looked.  On the other hand, if anyone could
do it it would be Union Carbide, and it has been a few years since I
did search the literature.
<p>
I can imagine that some kind of sealed high pressure CZ puller could drive
the dopants back into the melt.
<p>
Of course the dopant level of a ruby laser is much less than a gemstone.  How
do they grow titanium doped sapphire?  Anyone know?
<p>
(From: charlesk@vloc.com.)
<p>
As Fred pointed out UC grows ruby by Czochralski as does VLOC (without patent
violations, mind you) and we do it quite well as pointed out by the Rogers
(Thanks for the recommend).  Mark, Czochralski is the preferred method for
ruby growth for lasers, has been for a while.  Now Ti:Sapphire is a different
story, probably due to the higher dopant levels as you surmised.  Crystal
Systems can probably answer that point.
<p>
There is more information on the <A HREF="http:// www.vloc.com/">VLOC Web
Site</A>.

<h3><A NAME="sslgem">Gem Stones from SS Laser Material?</a></h3>

<blockquote>
"Does Nd:YAG material yield interesting gems when cut?  Is it actually
 considered a "gem"?  I think I have a piece of scrap material left over
 after a bunch of laser rods were cut from it.  It's interesting to show to
 people because it appears transparent to slightly yellowish under most
 fluorescent illumination, but becomes magenta/pink under full-spectrum
 illumination."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Chris Cox (ccox@slip.net).)
<p>
Yes, and gem faceters like it.  Nd:YAG is considered a man-made gem material.
It will go almost clear under some more recent rare-earth fluorescent lamps
(which confused me when I brought some home. ;-)
<p>
There are many types of these crystals, which are referred to as "color
change" materials in lapidary/gemstone circles.
<p>
(From: Uncle Al (UncleAl0@hate.spam.net).)
<p>
Ditto glassblowers' didymium glass lenses and the fabulous gem alexandrite,
sunlight versus candle light or incandescent illumination (blue in sunlight, red
in cool illumination).
<p>
See: "Man-Made Gemstones" by Elwell.
<p>
Laser crystals make more than passable gems if they are hard enough to retain
facetting and especially if they are optically isotropic.  Pale laser ruby
doesn't look like much, but if you give it a megarad of Co<sup>60</sup> gamma
(piggyback on a medical sterilization) you get a superlative tawny orange.
(Facet first, because warming to above 100 C gives F-center decay and an eerie
deep red glow as it returns to pale pink).

<h3><A NAME="ssldia">Diamond for Solid State Lasers?</A></h3>

Although the idea of a diamond laser was popularized in the James Bond motion
picture: "Diamonds are Forever", there is nothing particularly unique about
the diamond material that would make it inherently vastly superior for laser
applications and diamond is an exceptional difficult crystal to produce
synthetically.  Pure diamond isn't suitable anyhow as a lasing medium but
could be a host (like YAG can be a host) for doping with the actual lasing
ion.  However, there are to my knowledge, no commercial lasers using a
diamond host material, though as the cost of synthetic diamond has decreased,
it may appear as a heatsink due to its high thermal conductivity, strength,
and other desirable physical properties.
<p>
(From: A. E. Siegman" (siegman@stanford.edu).)
<p>
I also have a vague memory that maybe there was a diamond solid state laser 
doped with Cr or Fe or a RE at some point way back, but I'm not sure 
about that, and you'll have to do the digging in some of the standard 
handbooks of laser transitions to check if this is correct.
<p>
If by a "diamond laser" you mean in general "diamond as the host 
material, doped with something as the laser atoms", well then diamond is 
just another host, competing with YAG, sapphire, etc  It might have some 
useful attributes in competition with these others -- thermal 
conductivity, fracture strength, ability to polish -- but the others are 
already generally pretty good, and diamond isn't likely to be a miracle 
material in comparison.
<p>
An interesting connection between diamond and laser technology is 
that some diamonds have small internal flaws that are visible because 
they contain some uncrystallized carbon or other impurities.  If you use 
laser drilling to drill a tiny tunnel in to the hole and vaporize out 
the impurity, the remaining tunnel and empty void inside the diamond 
become much less visible because of the high index of diamond, and the 
diamond's value as a gemstone can be substantially increased.  I believe 
this practice is in routine commercial use. 
<p>
I recall that in the '60s I had a visitor who was in the diamond 
industry and wanted to start up a venture to implement this technique.  
Getting involved in that kind of imaginative venture wasn't my thing at 
the time (or ever, I'm afraid), so I didn't jump at the chance -- maybe 
I should have.  
<p>
Of course there was also the marine researcher who wanted to develop a 
CO2 laser gun to brand serial numbers on whales as they surfaced, to 
make marine surveys more accurate -- and the student who wanted to mount 
a similar laser on a pickup truck to brand cattle on the fly, which I 
think later actually got tried somewhere, and may in fact be a good idea.
And so on.
<p>
(From: Harvey Rutt xh.ruttx@x.ecs.soton.ac.uk).)
<p>
And in our lab then the guy who wanted to slice mushrooms which apparently 
difficult commercially (can't keep the knives sharp enough it was claimed), 
and substantial money was spent on slicing up foamed toffee brittle into bars 
with lasers (it sticks to the slitting knives...) but the customers didn't
like the caramelised taste!
<p>
However, RE: diamond.
<p>
Aside from the 'technological' issues such as thermal conductivity, 
toughness and hardness etc there are some more fundamental issues which don't 
seem to have been mentioned.
<p>
If you go for a dopant system, you need solubility of the dopant. Diamond is 
a strongly covalent lattice, with a very small covalent radius. This will 
make it hard to get the typical laser ions in in any reasonable amount in 
the right valence state.
Also the crystal field strength and symmetry at the impurity site has to be 
'right' to provide appropriate energy levels (Tanabe Sugano diagrams, if I 
spelled it right); they will be very different in diamond I suspect, and might 
need different dopants and level schemes.
So you might be looking to unconventional, small atom impurities with a 
liking for covalent sites, like nitrogen which is well known in diamond; but 
are there any suitable level schemes?
<p>
You also need good (low) non radiative relaxation rates from the upper laser 
state; but diamond must have very high phonon energies (light atoms, 
strongly bound) which correlate with high non radiative rates. This will be 
especially bad for IR transitions (its the photon to phonon energy ratio 
that matters, if less than 5 or 6, trouble usually.)
<p>
If you tried to do a diode laser, I assume diamond is an indirect
semiconductor like Ge and Si? (I don't know - does anyone?) and I think
injection  diode lasers are not possible in an indirect gap material -
aside from  getting adequate doping densities and profiles, but thats mere
technology :-)
<p>
A colour centre laser? That might be the best bet, if some diamond colour 
centre has suitable levels. But it must be said the many conventional alkali 
halide, etc., colour centre lasers were all a bit pathetic and have been 
dropped.
<p>
(From: Professor Siegmen.)
<p>
Harvey's comments, as always, informed, to the point, and well put.
<p>
Just in case it might be of interest to the OP, I believe there were at 
one time some experiments on doped s-s lasers in another gemstone 
material, emerald, and they also seem to have been dropped.
<p>
Also, alexandrite (is that considered a gemstone?), which does offer 
some special advantages and was commercialized by a company called Light 
Age, spun out of Allied Chemical, though it's not been a roaring success.

<h3><A NAME="sslcer">Ceramic Solid State Lasers</A></h3>

While most common ceramics are anything but transparent, it is possible to
produce ceramics that are transparent.  These have been used for a long time
in applications like missile seeker heads that need to be transparent to IR for
target acquisition and homing.  However, until recently, the quality was not
adequate for lasers which require nearly perfect transparency and minimal
scatter.  But that is changing and it is now possible to produce large
ceramic shapes that approach the clarity of single crystals and have
superior properties in terms of hardness and fracture resistance.
<p>
A ceramic is formed by using heat and pressure to merge a nano-fine powder
of the desired material at slightly below its melting point.  The result
is not a single crystal but an aggregate of small crystals.  Nonetheless, the
ratio of crystal volume to grain boundary volume is so large that the lasing
behavior is almost identical to that of a single crystal (i.e., the result
with Nd:YAG is a homogeneously broadened gain profile just like the
crystalline host).
<p>
There are a number of benefits to using a ceramic rather than a crystalline
host.  Some of the most important include:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fabrication and cost:</b> There is no fundamental limit to the
 size and shape that can be formed and less material is wasted.  The
 time required from start to finish is shorter.  So, cost, especially
 for larger sizes, should be much lower.
<p>
<li><b>Doping:</b> The doping is already part of the precursor material so
 it can be controlled very precisely and doesn't tend to collect in one
 part as with the crystal pulling techniques.  And there is no stressed core
 section that is normally useless as with the Czochralski method.  The
 doping profile can even be tailored.  For example, high in the central
 area but zero around it so side pumping can be used.  Or, even a combination
 of an Nd:YAG gain section and Cr<sup>4+</sup>:YAG passive Q-switch section
 in one monolithic structure.
<p>
<li><b>Doping concentration/pumping:</b> The ceramic process allows much
 higher doping levels to be achieved since the small grain size enables
 stress induced by lattice mismatch to be relieved in short distances.
 Furthermore, since the dopant is part of the original powder, there is
 no problem with nonuniformity as with crystal pulling techniques.  Higher
 doping concentrations allow for pumping at wavelengths that might otherwise
 be too inefficient.  For example, pumping Nd:YAG at 885 nm can improve
 the quantum efficiency by 10 percent compared to pumping at 808 nm.
<p>
<li><b>Choice of hosts/dopants:</b> While the first materials to be
 processed in this way have been traditional lasing mediums like Nd:YAG
 and Yb:YAG, other new ones that might not have been possible to grow
 using traditional techniques are possible.
</ul>

<h2>Optical Pump Sources</h2>

Solid state lasers are generally pumped optically.  This may be from xenon
flashlamps which are probably larger but otherwise basically similar to
those in photographic electronic flash units; via continuous arc xenon,
krypton, or other discharge lamps, or more recently - and constantly growing
in popularity for many reasons - high power laser diodes or laser diode arrays.
<p>
Flashlamps are the method of choice where high peak power is required.  None
of the alternatives can produce the short, high intensity, burst of light
needed to pump a solid state laser for the generation of optical output pulses
with peak power measured in Megawatts or more.  While the xenon flashlamp
is most common, other gas fills may be used to tailor the output spectrum to
more closely match the absorption bands of the solid state lasing medium.
However, none are really that great and most of the light ends up as waste
heat that must be removed - one of the major limitations on maximum pulse rate.
<p>
Arc lamps were used in the past where CW operation was required.  However,
a major difficulty with these was the need to remove kWs or 10s of kW of waste
heat from the lamp, rod, and cavity components.  Circulating water or oil was
needed along with a separate 'chiller' unit for cooling.  Arc lamps are
rapidly being replaced by arrays of high power laser diodes which are at least
10 times more efficient partially because their output is at the precise
absorption wavelength of the solid state lasing medium.  They can usually be
convection or force air cooled and operate from a regular 115 VAC outlet.
<p>
Other types of light sources including the Sun and halogen lamps have been
used where the physics permits (Nd:YAG, for example), but their efficiency
is very low and the heat dissipation problems are significant.  Due to
the continuous spectrum produced by these sources, the percentage of light
that matches the absorption bands of the solid state lasing medium is quite
small.  And, for the halogen lamp, at most 10 percent of the electrical
input power ends up as visible light to begin with (the rest is IR or heat
with a bit of UV).
<p>
(From: Leonard Migliore (lm@laserk.com).)
<p>
There are lots of CW Nd:YAG lasers. Laser markers are, most commonly,
CW-pumped Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers. The rod (or slab) is generally immersed in
water, with illumination by arc lamps or diodes going through the water. They
get very unhappy with even a momentary loss of cooling.
<p>
The laser mode is quite sensitive to the amount of heat being pumped into
the rod; they only work properly over a narrow range of lamp currents. I
don't think you could get any output out of an air-cooled YAG rod before
it cracked.

<h3><A NAME="sslxen">Xenon Flashlamps</A></h3>

Xenon flashlamps come in all shapes and sizes - from those less than 1 inch
long used in disposable cameras to monsters a meter or more in length used to
pump the Nd:Glass optics of the NOVA and NIF lasers.
<p>
There are many possible configurations.  Which one is used may depend on many
factors including the type and shape of the lasing medium (rod, slab, etc.),
cooling requirements, and cost:
<ul>
<li>Helical flashlamp.  The original ruby laser was pumped by a helical
 flashlamp (possibly a standard model for a photographic strobe or other
 application) in a polished cylindrical reflector.  While this is often the
 popular idea of how a pulsed laser is constructed, it really isn't
 particularly advantageous compared to simpler schemes and is probably
 relatively uncommon in practice.  In fact, it may actually be worse with
 respect to uniform and efficient coupling to the laser rod and is certainly
 more expensive.
<p>
<li>Single linear flashlamp.  This is probably most common for small solid
 state lasers.  When mounted in an ellipsoidal reflector with the flashlamp
 at one focus and the rod at the other, the coupling of light to the rod is
 very efficient.  Just wrapping the rod and lamp with degreased aluminum foil
 works pretty well also for a bare bones implementation (and the aluminum
 foil becomes your trigger electrode).
<p>
<li>Multiple linear flashlamps.  The pump energy can be increased by arranging
 multiple flashlamps around the rod, each in its own lobe of a multi-lobe
 ellipsoidal reflector (sort of shaped like a clover).  The energy increases
 nearly linearly with the number of lamps used.
<p>
<li>Coaxial.  A linear flashlamp is inserted in a hole in the center of the
 lasing medium with a polished cylindrical reflector surrounding it.  I don't
 know if this has ever been done for solid state lasers but dye lasers have
 used this unusual but very efficient configuration.
</ul>
<p>
The cavity reflector is often made of polished metal formed or milled
to the desired ellipsoidal or other shape.  However, some lasers may use a
compacted white powder coating on the outside of the glass or quartz flow tube
holding the rod and lamp(s) or between flow tubes.  The exact composition
isn't critical as long as it has a high reflectivity and is stable.
One such material contains barium sulfate.  See: <A HREF=
"http://www.labsphere.com/">Labsphere</A>.  Search for "white coating".
Another one is magnesium oxide.  Similar
products are available from Edmund Scientific (actually made by Kodak).
It is sprayed on from a can.  In general, I wouldn't recommend attempting
to remove these sorts of coatings unless they are visibly damaged.

<h4><A NAME="sslfls">Interpreting Xenon Flashlamp Specifications</A></h4>

Among the critical parameters determining the characteristics of a flashlamp
are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Size - This is usually specified in millimeters.
<p>
 A common model of linear flashlamp is the EG&G FXQ-1300-2 which has a total
 length of 115.8 mm long, 4 mm outside diameter, and 2 mm inside diameter.
<p>
<li>Minimum voltage - This is the lowest voltage at which reliable triggering
 is guaranteed.  For small photographic flashlamps such as those in pocket
 cameras, this may be as low as 200 V.  It is quite likely that any given
 sample will operate reliably below the specified minimum voltage but it isn't
 guaranteed and as the tube ages (with use), the value may creep up.
<p>
 For the FXQ-1300-2, above, the rating is 500 V.
<p>
<li>Explosion energy - This is the amount of energy in J or w-s that may result
 in instant and catastrophic disassembly of the flashlamp. :)  The explosion
 energy rating also depends on the discharge duration.
<p>
 For the FXQ-1300-2, the maximum explosion energy is 140 joules at a 100 us
 pulse duration and 500 joules at 1 ms.
<p>
<li>Average power - Electrode and envelope heating must be controlled to avoid
 rapid deterioration of outright failure of the flashlamp.  This rating will
 be dependent on the type of cooling.
<p>
<li>FXQ-1300-2 is limited to 50 watts if convection cooled.
</ul>
<p>
See <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslegg">EG&G 1300 Series Linear Flashlamp
Specifications and Links</A> for detailed info on the other models.
<p>
Here are some notes on the K factor and its relationship to flashlamp
voltage and current:
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (don@misty.com).)
<p>
<ul>
<li>K has the units ohms-amps<sup>1/2</sup>.  Put another way, the flashlamp's
 effective resistance is equal to K/sqrt(I).  Thus, the flashlamp's resistance
 at 1 amp is K, 1/10th of K at 100 amps, etc.  Current as a function of
 voltage is (V/K)<sup>2</sup>.  Voltage as a function of current is K*sqrt(I).
<p>
<li>The Flashlamp resistance is a function of instantaneous current.  If you
 figure it as a function of flashlamp voltage, it is a function of
 instantaneous flashlamp voltage.  Thus, it varies throughout a flash.
<p>
<li>Flashlamp voltage at peak current of an ideally damped flash is about 58
 percent of the initial capacitor voltage.
<p>
<li>If you plot flashlamp voltage as a function of time with the assumption of
 K describing the flashlamp no matter how low the voltage and current go, then
 flashlamp voltage towards the end of an ideally damped flash looks like a
 straight line that stops on a dime when voltage hits zero.  Current and
 capacitor voltage as a function of time will look different.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="ssleqs">Useful Equations for Flashlamp Selection and PFN
 Design</A></h4>

These equations can be used to aid in identifying a suitable flashlamp given
the energy and pulse width requirements of a laser, and to determine the
capacitance, inductance, and voltage required of the pulse forming network
(PFN).  For additional design information and some handy design aids, see the
chapter: <A HREF="lasersps.htm#spstoc">SS Laser Power Supplies</A>.
<p>
The following are from the EG&G (now Perkin Elmer) "High Performance
Flash and Arc Lamps" available at the
<A HREF="http://optoelectronics.perkinelmer.com/">Perkin Elmer
Optoelectronics</A> Web site for that document.  (Using the search
terms "High Performance" is sufficient.)
<p>
<b>Explosion energy:</b>
<p>
(Thanks to Doug Little for helping to put the following into a more consistent
form.)
<p>
The explosion energy is the energy input at which a particular flashlamp is
likely to fail after (or during!) a single shot at a given pulse width.  As
will be seen, longer pulses result in much higher explosion energy values.
The calculation for explosion energy takes into account the parameters of the
lamp that are fixed (material, construction, diameter, length) and those
which change (pulse width, and the resulting current for a given energy).
Keeping the equations separate helps clarify the difference between the
fixed lamp specification and varying conditions for a given application.
<p>
For convenience (or to make this seem more obscure!), the fixed parameters
are lumped into a single number called Ke, which could be printed on the
flashlamp box because it is a constant for a given flashlamp.
<p>
<PRE>
 Ke = Q * d * l
</PRE>
<p>
Where:
<ul>
<li>Ke = single shot explosion constant (not joules!).
<li>Q = quartz coefficient (effectively the strength of the quartz envelope).
<li>d = bore inner diameter, in millimeters.
<li>l = arc length, in millimeters.
</ul>
<p>
Typical values of Q vary from around 190 to 250 for a typical of xenon
lamp, based loosely on the lamp's diameter.  Older xenon lamps such as the
FX-103C have an estimated Q of 194.  The Perkin Elmer catalog gives the
following typical values based on lamp bore (I believe this is ID): 8 mm - 246,
10 to 12 mm - 210, 13 mm - 200.
<p>
Special fast-risetime lamps (which are probably for dye lasers) basically
double this value to 400 to 500.  There is no obvious way to tell a fast
risetime lamp from others, except perhaps that flash pumped dye lasers
tend to be considerably longer than the longest YAG rods, so the lamps
will normally be longer too (200 mm arc is getting into dye laser
territory).
<p>
The second equation calculates explosion energy in joules, based on the
lamp's Ke constant and the desired pulse length.
<p>
<pre>
    Ex = Ke * (1/3 * t)<sup>1/2</sup>
</pre>
<p>
Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Ex = explosion energy (joules).
<li>Ke = single shot explosion constant (see below).
<li>t = current pulse width (seconds).
</ul>
<p>
So, explosion energy goes up as the square root of the pulse width.
<p>
Here are some approximate guidelines for lamp life versus input
energy/explosion energy
(Eo/Ex):
<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
<b>Ko parameter:</b>
<p>
The design of the PFN would be trivial if the flashlamp behaved as a
simple resistor.  Unfortunately, it is a dynamic impedance with a value
designated as Ko (units: ohms-amps<sup>1/2</sup>).  The Ko parameter
determines the voltage across the lamp as a function of current just like
a resistor except that the effective resistance (ER) is a function of current.
For example, at 1 A, the ER of the lamp is Ko; at 100 A, it is Ko/10, at
10,000 A, it is Ko/100, and so forth.
<p>
<pre>
    V = Ko * |i|<sup>1/2</sup>

Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>V = voltage across the lamp (Volts).
<li>i = current through the lamp (Amps).

<li>d = bore size (mm).
<li>p = fill pressure (Torr).
<li>x = magic constant: 450 for xenon, 805 for krypton.
</ul>
<p>
<b>C, L, and V for optimal PFN design:</b>
<p>
Normally, it is desired that the circuit be critically damped.  This puts
the most energy into the flashlamp in the shortest time without undershoot.
For a given flashlamp Ko value, there are unique values for C, L, and V
given the desired flash energy and pulse width.

 1/3rd peak, t<sub>1/3</sub>, is approximately equal to T*3.)
<li>Ko = lamp impedance parameter from equation, above.
</ul>

<b>Peak current:</b>

It is important to know the peak current since it affects the spectral
output and to assure that it is within the ratings of the lamp.

<h4><A NAME="sslsim">Flashlamp Simmering</A></h4>

No, this isn't what happens when the flashlamp gets too hot and starts
bubbling until well done. :)
<p>
For single-shot and low repetition rate flashlamp pumped SS lasers,
the flashlamp is used as both the light source and the discharge switch.
In these systems, the energy storage capacitor (part of the pulse forming
network) is charged to a voltage specified by the desired flash energy.
A trigger pulse is then applied either to the outside of the lamp, or
in series or parallel with the energy storage capacitor which ionizes
the xenon gas in the flashlamp allowing the capacitor to discharge through it.
<p>
But for multiple-shot and high repetition rate flashlamp pumped SS lasers,
using the flashlamp as the switch is both technically challenging and also
hard on the flashlamp.
<p>
An alternative that is widely used is to trigger the flashlamp once and then
run it at a controlled low current in between pulses.  So, it runs more like
a low current arc lamp most of the time.  A separate "simmer"
power supply usually provides both the high voltage trigger pulse and the
simmer current.  A current of between 50 and 500 mA is typical.
<p>
However, what this means is that a separate means must be used to control
the main current pulse through the flashlamp.  In modern lasers, this
may be an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT), thryristor (SCR
or triac), or other similar high current fast acting solid state switch.
Where an IGBT is used, very precise control of both the start and end, and
thus energy, of the flashlamp can be provided.  Older lasers might use
thyratron or ignitron tubes.
<p>
Basic SS lasers don't need this added complexity.  But where the repetition
rate is greater than perhaps 1 Hz maintained, up to several hundred Hz,
the added complexity of the simmer circuitry becomes worthwhile.
<p>

flashlamps and arc lamps, and support electronics.  For example, see

A couple of excellent references for the general design of flashlamp based
systems are the "EG&G Linear Flashlamp Technical Brief" and the

(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).) 
<p>
The maximum energy that a flashlamp can withstand is referred to as
the 'explosion energy' and it is the energy at which the flashlamp is
most likely to fracture. This explosion energy is determined by a number
of factors including the type of lamp, size, and current pulse width. If
a flashlamp is indeed built for laser pumping it would be of quartz
construction but could actually be a number of different models.
<p>
For example, a new, EG&G, FXQ-1302-3 (4 mm bore x 76 mm arc length)
flashlamp has an explosion energy of 360 joules for a 100 us pulse. As
pulse width is increased, explosion energy rises.
<p>
In other words, you cannot just buy any old flashlamp driver and
expect it to operate your particular flashlamp. I would suggest building
your own pulse forming network for your application. It is not overly
difficult (although can be very dangerous) if you have some background
in electronics. All the formulas to calculate what you'll require are in
a booklet available from EG&G or in any good book that deals with
solid-state lasers. Capacitors for operating such a small flashlamp are
readily available at very reasonable prices.
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (don@misty.com).)
<p>
The "EG&G Linear Flashlamp Technical Brief" has a very general rule that
has a fair chance of being good for most quartz flashtubes, even someone
else's.  As for glass?  Stay below both half the quartz limit and the tube's
regular ratings, and it will probably be OK.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslegg">EG&G 1300 Series Linear Flashlamp
Specifications and Links</A>.
<p>
And EG&G recommends staying below 30 percent of the explosion energy if
you want the tube to have a reasonable life expectancy.
<p>
For really short pulse width, the limiting factor is ablation - evaporation of
the glass or quartz.  The vapor decomposes in the arc and you get oxygen among
whatever else.  The oxygen really increases voltage requirements for flashing.
If the electrodes get hot enough, they may react with the oxygen and may
remove most of it, but then you may discolor the inner surface of the tube
with oxide in addition to any discolorations from silicon or other
decomposition products.
<p>
I have been through this, and even did some damage to a quartz tube with
just a few joules per flash.  Heimann DGS0610 (10 mm arc length) does not
like voltage much above 300 volts combined with a few joules of energy,
nor 1.5 kV at even a fraction of a joule.

<h4><A NAME="sslxff">Flashlamp Failure Behavior and Causes</A></h4>

(Portions from: Don Klipstein (don@misty.com).)
<p>
When a flashlamp fails, it may do so quietly or with a bang.
<p>
Generally, only laser pump flashlamps or similar ones with a lot of flash
energy for their size will likely die spectacularly.  When lower power
flashlamps such as those used in small to medium size photographic strobes
crack, they tend to stay in one piece or sometimes break apart surprisingly
quietly.
<p>
<ul>
<li>A hairline crack would enable air to enter resulting in a flashlamp that
 doesn't work but might remain intact, at least to casual handling.  This is
 more common than spectacular failure.
<p>
<li>A crazed flashlamp may crack or break into two pieces when fired.
<p>
<li>A high mileage lamp may show discoloring, mostly around the area of the
 cathode.
<p>
<li>Low quality or old flashtubes may have traces of air in them due to
 imperfect seals.  Oxygen and water vapor will make the flashlamp more
 difficult to fire.  In a high power lamp where the electrodes get hot
 enough to react with any oxygen or water vapor, oxides can form and
 collect on the inner surface of the tube, resulting in a powdery
 discoloration.  I have seen a whole batch of older camera flashes with
 leaky flashtubes with varying ability to fire.
</ul>
<p>
As for failure modes due to abuse:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Too much energy on a cheap glass flashtube - they just crack.  10 times
 too much and what they usually do is just crack all over and fall apart
 easily, but maybe they could explode.  You may hear the tube crackling
 during the roughly two seconds after such a fatal flash.  One that I had
 broke into two pieces and with no bang nor even a loud pop with about 3
 times its rated energy.
<p>
<li>With moderately excessive energy the first big flash is not fatal.  But
 a discolored area of the tubing will get hotter than an adjacent clear area
 during a subsequent flash, and this can crack the tubing.  I once abused a
 flashtube this way (with about three times its maximum rated energy), and
 the first flash caused discoloration and the second flash cracked the tube
 around one edge of the discoloration.
<p>
<li>Excessive flash energy to quartz flashtubes with lower xenon pressure
 such as most photocopier and higher power photoflash lamps will usually
 just discolor them at an unacceptably high rate if the voltage is not also
 excessive.  Seals could fail however.  Obviously, there is some amount of
 energy that will cause the lamp to crack, break, explode, or melt or do a
 combination of these things.
<p>
<li>Excessive average power input to a cheap glass flashtube will cause it
 to crack, often not doing so until after some discoloration develops.
<p>
<li>Excessive average power input to a quartz flashtube usually causes
 accelerated discoloration or risks the seals, but if you're lucky nothing
 bad happens until the quartz tubing gets soft enough to slowly, slightly 
 give way (900 to 1000 &deg;C or hotter) and then cracks from stresses.
<p>
<li>High power quartz lamps that heat up to a few hundred &deg;C or 
 hotter should be clean.  Ash, salts, and alkalis will slowly leach into
 hot quartz and cause stresses that may make the tubing crack.
<p>
<li>With too much voltage while pushing limits of energy or average power
 the flashtube may crack more easily from higher heating of the glass by UV.
<p>
<li>Exceeding some combination of voltage and flash energy) will cause "wall
 ablation" - in which traces of the tubing material is vaporized.  This
 happens from exceeding some combination of total flash energy and peak flash
 power.  The vapor is mostly silicon dioxide and it will decompose in the hot
 xenon arc.  The resulting oxygen will make the flashtube harder to fire.  The
 tubing will also discolor or sometimes just get cloudy, usually unevenly if
 flash energy is low and voltage is extremely high.  In high power flashlamps
 where the electrodes get hot enough to react with the free oxygen, powdery
 oxide can form and collect on the inner surface of the tube.  But this
 process will remove some of the oxygen and can restore ease of firing the
 flashtube.
<p>
<li>Reverse polarity on a polarity-sensitive flashtube will sometimes impair
 flashing but usually not.  Tube discoloration will occur more easily and
 may cover more of the tube more easily.  But not all flashtubes are
 polarity sensitive.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="sslafa">About Flashlamp and Arc Lamp Polarity</A></h4>

Polarity is critical!  The anode and cathode are not the same due to materials
properties and/or shape.  Running a xenon lamp with reverse polarity at
anywhere near its rated energy will result in almost immediate, and possibly
violent failure.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The cathode may be a conical (pointed) shape to help direct the arc away
 from the tube walls.  If run in reverse, the arc will tend to slither along
 the walls of the tube rather than remaining mostly in the center.
<p>
<li>The cathode may be coated with an electron emitter (arc lamps only) to
 reduce the "work function" (voltage drop) and thus the power dissipation.
 If run in reverse, the cathode will get excessively hot likely melting or
 shattering the lamp, possibly with a KABOOM!  There will also be excessive
 sputtering which will quickly darken the tube walls in the area of the
 electrode if it doesn't fail entirely.
</ul>
<p>
Even if the ends appear to be identical, check the manufacturers specs to be
sure that they are identical - they probably aren't!
<p>
(From: Don Klipstein (don@misty.com).)
<p>
Some xenon flashtubes do have identical electrodes and can be operated in
either polarity.  If the flashtube is polarized, wrong-way operation usually
shortens the life by sputtering or overheating the anode (being used as a
cathode), or by having getter material evaporated from the normal cathode
location, drift to what is being used as the cathode and, discoloring much of
the tubing along the way - active metal vapors in discharge lamps tend to have
some positive ions and will drift to the negative nd.
<p>
I have seen some flashtubes have difficulty flashing the wrong way.
Usually an extra hundred volts can force an anode to work as a cathode.
<p>
Arc lamps may have thermionic emission materials on their cathodes
(but not flashlamps).  Abusing an anode as a cathode will usually overheat
it, often sputter it, and the arc can have an excessive voltage drop (and
then conduct less current) which often leads to the arc being less stable,
and the arc tube material can overheat around the anode being abused as a
cathode.  If the arc voltage rises more than the arc current decreases
(common), then the whole lamp can overheat - but I think overheating will
mostly be around what is being misused as a cathode.  Then again, if the
lamp discolors from sputtered electrode material then it can absorb light
and overheat.

<h4><A NAME="ssltfa">Testing Flashlamps and Arc Lamps</A></h4>

First, visually inspect the lamp for obvious damage or excessive discoloration
(which would indicate a high mileage lamp or one that has been abused).
Obviously, if the lamp is cracked, its use is questionable to say the least. :)
Seriously, even if the gas hasn't leaked out/atmosphere leaked in, firing
a cracked lamp could result in a shower of glass or quartz bits.
Discoloration will reduce the light output somewhat but the lamp may still be
usable.
<p>
The simplest electrical test is to apply a current limited high voltage to
confirm ionization.  The required peak voltage will need to be greater than
the trigger voltage for the lamp.  An easy way to do this is with a neon
sign or oil burner ignition transformer on a Variac.  Current limiting is
built in.  An adjustable high voltage power supply with a few hundred K
ohms of high voltage ballast resistance can also be used.  Since very little
current is required, almost any source of HV will do.  The start voltage from
a helium-neon laser power supply will be sufficient for smaller lamps.
<p>
Start at 0 V and turn it up until the lamp fires.  For a small (e.g., 2 inch)
xenon flashlamp, this will typically be in the 4 to 8 kV range; for a medium
size arc lamp, perhaps 10 to 15 kV; large ones may require 30 kV or more.
The start voltage will depend on the gas type (xenon or krypton typically),
fill pressure, tube inside diameter, and amount of use or abuse.
<p>
At these low currents, the operating voltage is probably no where near what
it would be at normal current but with this approach, if the lamp fires at
all, it is most likely good.  The appearance of the discharge at the gas
pressure inside the arc lamps is similar to that of a plasma globe - streamers
of lightning that move around in response to (internal) thermal gradients
and possibly even (external) proximity to conductive materials like fingers.
So, if you don't want to use the lamp for a laser, it could be powered from a
little HV module and make an interesting display piece. :)
<p>
It should be possible to do further testing of arc lamps using an ion laser
power supply (but if running for more than a couple seconds, most excellent
cooling will be required).  This is left for the advanced course.
<p>
(From: Chris (ndyaglaser_chrisc@yahoo.com).)
<p>
The most important aspect of determining what you have is to be able to
differentiate between a flashlamp and an arc lamp. This can be somewhat
difficult without a history or printed specifications for the lamps.
These linear lamps may look very similar in outward physical appearance
but are constructed and used very differently. If one were to use an
arc lamp in a flashlamp circuit, there would be disastrous and
dangerous results. There is not normally a 'gas mix' in either of these
types of lamps but is usually either pure xenon or pure krypton. A
spectrometer can be used to determine
which gas fill is present. The envelope for the 'better' flashlamps is
usually constructed from a type of fused silica (quartz). While passing
a continuous high voltage discharge through the lamp, the strong odor
of ozone will almost assuredly indicate a fused silica envelope.
A glass envelope would not allow the UV to pass and produce the
copious ozone odor. Arc lamps are usually krypton filled (to a few
atmospheres of pressure) and have at least one pointed electrode for
arc stability. Unfortunately some flashlamps may contain one pointed
electrode also, but this is not very common. Flashlamps usually have
two rounded electrodes but can filled with either xenon or krypton gas
at a reduced pressures.
To sum things up:
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a krypton fill and a pointed electrode, I'd assume it's
 an arc lamp.
<p>
<li>If you have two rounded electrodes and a xenon fill, I'd assume
 it's a flashlamp.
<p>
<li>If you have two rounded electrodes and a krypton fill, I'd assume
 it's a flashlamp.
<p>
<li>If you have a xenon fill and a pointed electrode, it's probably a
 flashlamp.  But maybe not.
</ul>
<p>
Remember what they say about assumptions though!
If you are positive that that you indeed have flashlamps in your
possession than the only thing you need now determine is the explosion
energy of the particular lamp and the proper operating parameters to
prevent proving that explosion energy rating. Energy and time (pulse
width) both play a very important role in the safe operation of any
flashlamp.

<h3><A NAME="sslodl">Continuous Arc Discharge lamps</A></h3>

Arc lamps also use a gas discharge like a flashlamp but are designed to
dissipate the tremendous amount of power needed for continuous operation.
Power consumption will be in the kW or 10s of kW range.  Thus, an arc lamp
pumped laser will almost always have significant cooling associated with
it - either high CFM forced air or liquid oil or purified (de-ionized) water
with a separate chiller.
<p>
The most common arc lamps for solid state laser pumping are the xenon and
krypton variety.  Specifications for a variety of arc lamps used to be
available on the EG&G, now Perkin-Elmer, Web site but for now at least,
much of it is gone.  If you want more info, request their CDROM which
includes complete product specs as well as the EG&G technical papers that
used to be at their Web site.
<p>
Arc lamp power supplies have a lot in common with ion laser power supplies:
a relative low voltage (under 50 to several hundred VDC) at high current (many
AMPs) and a high voltage trigger required for starting.  (However, with their
massive cathode - where much of the destructive energy is dissipated - no
heated filament is used.)  See the chapters starting with:
<A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A> for general
information on systems that are similar to those for arc lamps.

<h3><A NAME="sslldp">High Power Laser Diodes</A></h3>

As noted, most modern CW solid state lasers are pumped by high power laser
diodes or laser diode arrays.  This approach solves many of the problems
associated with alternative pump sources like arc lamps, the main one being
efficiency (or lack thereof) and the associated immense heat dissipation
and power requirements.
<p>
Modern laser diodes are quite efficient and can be designed to produce the
precise wavelength needed to match an absorption band of the solid state lasing
medium.  For Nd:YAG, this is near-IR at 808 nm.  These laser diodes are
inexpensive (as these things go) at less than $10 a watt for small quantities
in chip form.  Arrays of diodes mounted side-by-side of 40, 100, or more
total WATTs are commercially available.  Multiple such laser diode bars may
be arranged surrounding a Nd:YAG rod.  Laser systems using several hundred
watts of laser diode pump power producing 100 W of coherent 1064 nm output or
perhaps 40 or 50 W of 532 nm frequency doubled green output are compact, can be
plugged into a standard 115 VAC outlet, and require not special cooling.
<p>
Power supplies (usually called 'drivers') for high power laser diodes must
be designed for absolute current limiting and to compensate for the change in
laser diode characteristics with temperature.  These types of laser diodes do
not have internal monitor photodiodes like their low power cousins so other
techniques must be used to regulate output power.  Needless to say, preventing
damage to these expensive laser diode arrays during power cycling, from power
surges, and many other possible dangers, is extremely critical.  See the
chapters starting with <A HREF="laserdio.htm#diotoc">Diode Lasers</A> for
more information.
<p>
And, if you are wondering...  No, LEDs really can't be used since not even
a truckload of those super bright Radio Shack LEDs can be focused to achieve
the required power density.  (Even the brightest produce at most a few mW
compared to the minimum of 1/2 W or so used in the smallest DPSS green laser
pointer.  In addition, being incoherent, their spectral width is much greater
than that of laser diodes for a given power, the electromagnetic field
intensity is lower.

<h3><A NAME="sslops">Other Pump Sources</A></h3>

In addition to flashlamps, arc lamps, and high power laser diodes, broad
spectrum sources like incandescent or halogen lamps have been used as well
as the Sun and even some light producing chemical reactions - but none of
these is really very popular due to the pathetic
efficiencies and need to remove huge amounts of waste heat (but see below).
About all that can be said for such approaches is that they use inexpensive
easy to use parts like the Sun. :)
<p>
Lasers (predating laser diodes) have also been used where their output
wavelength matched an absorption band of the target lasing medium.  However,
until the advent of the high power laser diode, such systems were very
expensive, had terrible efficiency, and were probably only used for very
specialized applications where there were no alternatives.

<h4><A NAME="sslhal">Bob's Comments on Halogen Lamp Pumped Lasers</A></h4>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
I have seen a General Photonics laser that put out 5 W, with a 'few' kW of
pump power - 2 or 3 or 4 - don't remember exactly how many. :)  This was one
HELL of a power hungry beast!  The reason is that the emission spectrum is
not matched to the laser rod.  In theory, if you looked at the emission
spectrum, you could shift it up or down by controlling the power to the
lamp and thus the temperature.  But I have no idea where to suggest one find
a spectrum for an off the shelf lamp unless you happened to have a
spectrophotometer to measure it. :)
<p>
My first laser was built with a 3 mm by 60 mm YAG rod, 2 tungsten halogen
lamps, an intracavity piece of lithium niobate, and focusing optic.  The rod
was cooled by a HUGE flow of forced air, and the laser could be run for 5 or
10 seconds at a time before it would overheat. The mirrors were set in
homemade mounts using 8-32 screws - NOT what you would call fine adjustment. :)
I used a HeNe laser for alignment, then hoped and prayed when it came time to
do actual alignment with the thing running, as there was such little time.
After about an hour of turning it on, then letting it cool for a minutes, I
saw some flashes of green light. Surely no more than microwatts, but then,
I was using a very crude, low power YAG in CW mode.... Still one heck of an
accomplishment if I do say so myself. :)

<h2>Resonator Mirrors</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sslmta">Mirror Types and Alignment</A></h3>

As with other types of lasers, the resonator in a SS laser (used as an
oscillator rather than an amplifier) will require mirrors at both ends.
<p>
The HR mirror may be dielectric, metal coated, or a corner or half-corner
reflector, to name just a few possibilities depending on the lasing wavelength,
presence of additional cavity optics (like a Q-switch), and application.
The OC mirror will generally be either a dielectric or resonant optic (like the
one in the Hughes rangefinder.  A resonant optic is basically a multiplate
etalon with at least one of its peak reflectances adjusted to coincide with
the lasing line).  Both mirrors are likely planar so there are no focused
regions inside the rod.  However, this is not always the case.
<p>
Unlike low gain gas lasers, aluminized (metal coated) mirrors may have enough
reflectance (greater than 95 percent) to easily reach threshold in a solid
state laser.  However, in addition to the less than optimal reflectance for
the HR, that missing 5 percent is due to absorption, not transmission.  Thus,
a significant percentage of the pulse energy <i>inside</i> the resonator will
be deposited in the mirror coating as heat.  So, the damage threshold for
these metal coated mirrors is much lower than for dielectric mirrors (with
the highest damage threshold likely to be for resonant type optics).  In other
words, at some modest peak pulse power, you may end up with a nice clear spot
(or worse) where your metallic mirror coating used to be. :(
<p>
Where the laser operates at an IR (invisible) wavelength, it generally isn't
possible (or at least not easy) to determine the characteristics of dielectric
mirrors without test instruments.  In fact, it may not even be
possible to differentiate between the HR and OC by visual inspection!  They
may both appear very similar and virtually transparent to visible wavelengths.
If you have an unmarked laser head, assume that the beam could emerge from
either end unless one is obviously covered!  And, a resonant OC will probably
appear virtually transparent regardless of the wavelength of the laser.
<p>
On two YAG lasers I've seem up close and personal, the little SSY1 and an old
large quasi-CW Quantronix Model 114F-O/QS (see the descriptions later in this
chapter), the OC had a slight green tint in reflection.  The HR of SSY1 was
pale blue in reflection and the HR of the Quantronix was pale yellow in
reflection.  The color of transmitted light in all cases was as expected, a
very very pale complement of the reflected color (almost neutral clear).
Given that the appearance of the HRs of the two lasers were almost complements
of each-another for the same wavelength (1064 nm) suggests that it isn't
really possible to determine anything about anything by just viewing the
mirror colors of lasers producing invisible outputs. :)
<p>
Due to the typically high gain of the lasing medium, and its relatively large
diameter, mirror alignment may not be nearly as critical as with narrow-bore
low gain gas lasers despite the mirrors very likely being planar.  Thus, on a
short resonator, it is quite possible for there to be absolutely no
adjustments for mirror alignment - just a machined mating surface on the
rod-side of the mirror mount.
<p>
However, some lasers use a pair of "Risley" prisms between the rod and
HR mirror for fine alignment rather than adjustable mirror mounts.  A Risley
prism is a thin very slightly wedge AR coated glass plate.  With two of these
that can be rotated and then locked in place, fine alignment of the cavity
is possible.  Relatively large changes in orientation produce only
small changes in alignment which results in greater precision and stability
than with adjustable mirror mounts.
<p>
Note that SS lasers are often used as amplifiers rather than oscillators - the
light makes a single pass through the lasing medium and is boosted in
intensity.  In that case, there are no mirrors at all!

<h3><A NAME="sslglm">Using Gas Laser Mirrors in a Solid State Laser?</A></h3>

While this may be possible in some cases, there are a number of factors to
consider and it is probably not recommended:

<ul>
<li><b>Reflectivity:</b> Since they aren't designed for the solid state
 laser's wavelength, the reflectivity will likely not be optimal.  HeNe
 mirrors may have too high a reflectivity at the ruby's 694 nm but too low at
 YAG's 1,064 nm.  It would have to be measured.  Also, the Anti-Reflection (AR)
 coating will not be optimized for the new wavelength.
<p>
 CAUTION: If the resonator Q is too high due to high reflectivity of both the
 HR and OC, the peak power could be great enough to damage the rod, optics,
 and your disposition. :)
<p>
<li><b>Curvature:</b> Many HeNe and other similar mirrors are not planar.
 This is undesirable in a solid state laser because it results in a 'hot
 spots' - a region of concentrated energy where the circulating light flux is
 higher.  This reduces efficiency and may actually damage the rod in extreme
 cases.
<p>
<li><b>Diameter:</b> Lasers salvaged from HeNe or argon ion laser tubes are
 likely to be quite small - 6 to 10 mm diameter.  This may be marginal for all
 but the narrowest rods and will require careful centering and alignment.
<p>
<li><b>Peak power handling:</b> Gas laser mirrors aren't really designed for
 high peak power pulsed applications.  The coating may deteriorate quickly or
 be blown off by the first shot.  Even converting a CW arc lamp pumped laser to
 pulsed operation without changing the optics may be problematic.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="ssllwm">Lasing Without Mirrors</A></h3>

For people accustomed to the high quality high reflectivity mirrors and
precise mirror alingment needed to get anything out of many gas lasers (like
HeNe and Ar/Kr ion), it might come as a surpise that very little is needed
for many types of solid state lasers.  The gain of a laser rod may be on the
order of 10 or 20 percent per <b>inch</b> as opposed to less than 1 percent
per inch for a HeNe laser tube.  Thus, it doesn't take much to form a suitable
cavity - the reflectance of a SS laser OC can be quite low and still produce
an output under the right conditions.

Has anyone seen a Nd:YAG crystal lase off of 2 un-AR coated faces before?
This hapened to me last night when I was fooling around with some optics, well
OK, I did have the help of a 250 W, 808 nm laser diode array.  That might have
had something to do with it. :)
<p>
I have seen it in flash lamp pumed systems.  That's why so often you see a
pulsed amplifier rod with the ends cut with a wedge, so that you don't have
two parallel faces that are normal to the rod axis.  But I have never seen it
in a CW pumped scinerio, especially as one that is so 'photnically sloppy' All
I was doing was holding the rod in front (by hand) to see if the spontanious
emmision would be too bright to look at with my infra red viewer.  Good thing
I didn't look down the axis with my finderscope first, istead of looking at the
barrel, the converter tube in a find-r-scope isn't cheap to replace.
<p>
(From: Paul Pax (phpax@azstarnet.com).)
<p>
I've seen flashlamp pumped Nd:Glass rods lase from the two AR coated faces
before, the face were even at an angle to the rod axis. Got a fair amount of
power out, too.  I guess if you've got enough pump power, it doesn't take much
feedback.

<h2>Q-Switching</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sslwiq">What is Q-Switching?</A></h3>

A Q-switched laser is a type of (or modification to) a pulsed laser which
shortens it output pulse width, boosts peak output power, and improves the
consistency of the output from pulse to pulse.  However, there will likely
be a reduction in <i>total</i> energy in the output when a laser is operated
in Q-switch mode.
<p>
With a normal pulsed laser, the pumping source raises the active atoms of the
lasing medium to an upper energy state.  Almost immediately (even during the
pumping) some will decay, emitting a photon in the processes.  This is called
spontaneous emission.
<p>
If enough of the atoms are in the upper energy state (population inversion)
and one of these photons happens to be emitted in the direction so that it
will reflect back and forth between the mirrors of the resonator cavity,
laser action will commence as it triggers other similar energy transitions
and additional photons to be emitted (stimulated emission).  However, the
resulting laser pulse will be somewhat broad and of random shape from pulse
to pulse.
<p>
The idea of a Q-switched laser is that the resonator is prevented from being
effective until after the pumping pulse and most of the atoms are in the
upper energy state (the population inversion in as complete as possible).  Its
so-called Q is spoiled by in effect disabling one of the mirrors.  This can be
accomplished mechanically by simply rotating the mirror or an optical element
like a prism between the mirror and the lasing medium, or electro-optically
using something like a Pockel's cell (a high speed electrically controlled
optical shutter) in a similar location.  With the cavity not able to resonate
(mirror blocked or mirror at the wrong angle), there can be no buildup of
stimulated radiation.  There will still be the spontaneous emission but this
is a small drain on the upper energy state.
<p>
At a point in time just after the pumping is complete, the Q is restored so
that the resonator is once more intact - the mirror has rotated to be
perpendicular to the optical axis, for example.  At this instant, with a
nearly total population inversion, laser action commences resulting in a
short, intense, consistent laser pulse each time and the pump energy is used
more efficiently.  Peak optical output power can be much greater than it would
be without the Q-Switch.  Because of the short pulse duration - measured in
nanoseconds or picoseconds (or even less), peak power of megawatts or
gigawatts may be produced by even modest size lasers - with truly astounding
peak power available from large lasers like those found at
<A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/">Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory</A>.
<p>
Q-switching can be applied to a single-shot pulsed laser like one pumped
with a flashlamp as well as to a continuously pumped laser like one pumped
by an arc lamp or laser diodes.  For the latter cases which would run
CW without the Q-switch, the result will be a quasi-CW output typically
at rates up to several kHz.  In fact, many green laser pointers (which are
diode pumped frequency doubled Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> lasers) utilize a passive
Q-switch to boost efficiency in the non-linear doubling process and the
output is actually a series of pulses at several kHz.
However, the highest peak power is still achieved using
flashlamp pumping.  As noted above, to Q-switch a laser, the lasing
medium needs to be pumped with enough energy before the Q-switch is turned
on to supply the laser pulse.  For the very common YAG laser, this must happen
in a couple hundred microseconds or less (the upper state or fluorescence
lifetime of YAG, about 230 us).  This would require an arc lamp or diode
array to deliver enough energy into the rod in 200 us to result in the
desired output energy in the Q-switched lasing pulse.  For example, for a
very modest 100 mJ output, about 10 J would be needed assuming 1 percent
efficiency (as with an arc lamp) or about 1 J assuming 10 percent efficiency
(as with laser diodes).  This would require a 50,000 W arc lamp or 5,000 W
diode array, with all the associated power and cooling issues.  Neither of
these is very practical while a 10 J flashlamp is barely larger than the
electronic flash unit in a disposable camera!  So, high Q-switched pulse
energies may be possible in principle but whether such systems make sense
in terms of cost/performance is another matter.  An alternative which is
marginally more practical is to use an optical (e.g., YAG) amplifier to
boost the output of a lower power Q-switched laser but this would still
be a complex expensive system.
<p>
With a motor driven Q-switch, a sensor is used to trigger the flash lamp (pump
source) just before the mirror or other optical element rotates into position.
For the Kerr cell type, a delay circuit is used to open the shutter a precise
time after the flash lamp is triggered.
<p>
Q-Switched lasers are very often solid state optically pumped types (e.g.,
Nd:YAG, ruby, etc.) but this technique can be applied to many other (but not
all) lasers as well.
<p>
A somewhat related process, called <b>cavity dumping</b>, is sort of the
opposite of Q-switching: The intra-cavity power is allowed to build to a
maximum at which point an electro-optic device is pulsed to cause what is in
the cavity to go elsewhere.  Thus, a pulse roughly 2*L/c (L is the length of
the cavity and c is the speed of light) long is dumped from the cavity.
<p>
WARNING: With their extremely high peak power, these are nearly always
Class IV lasers!  Take extreme care if you are using or attempting the repair
of one of these.
<p>
CAUTION: For some lasers which run near their power limits, if the cavity is
not perfectly aligned, it may be possible to damage the optical components by
attempting to run near full power in Q-Switched mode.  Perform testing and
alignment while free running - not Q-Switched (rotating mirror set up to be
perpendicular or shutter open).  Use a CCD or other profiling technique to
adjust for a perfectly symmetric beam before enabling the Q-Switched mode.

<h3><A NAME="sslmqs">Mechanical Q-Switching</A></h3>

The simplest type of Q-switch uses a rotating mirror or prism to form one
end of the optical cavity.  A sensor triggers the pump source (flashlamp)
just before the mirror or other optical element rotates into position such
that the resonator mirrors are parallel to each other.  This is fairly easy to
do with ruby as the lasing medium with its long (3 ms) fluorescence lifetime.
However, the corresponding value for Nd:YAG is only 230 us.  Thus, only 100
to 200 us is available once the flashlamp fires and sensing the position of a
rotating optical element to this precision would be somewhat more difficult.
For example, at 6,000 rpm - 100 rps, 100 microseconds is 1/100th of a full
rotation.
<p>
Mechanical Q-switches aren't found that often if at all in modern equipment.
In addition to the difficulties in timing, having any high speed, wear prone,
low reliability moving parts in a high tech laser is just bad form. :)  The
only common pulsed laser I know of with a mechanical Q-switch is the popular
M-60 Tank rangefinder (which isn't exactly modern).
<p>
Alternatives to motors are electromagnetically or piezo-transducer wobbled or
vibrated optical elements.
<p>
The following comments relate to mechanical Q-switching of a Nd:YAG laser.
Since the fluorescence lifetime of YAG is less than 1/10th that of ruby,
the difficulty of implementing a mechanical Q-switch are greatly increased.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
It may not be as easy to use a rotating Q-switch with YAG, but it certainly
can be done. I have seen both a flashlamp pumped system by Litton that was
used by the military (presumably part of a REALLY non-eyesafe rangefinder)
and a medical laser that was arc lamp pumped from a European company.
For the modern laser amateur, perhaps a mirror mount with a piezo transducer
under one axis would work better than a rotating prism.  But that would
require one to be electronic saavy to build a driver.
<p>
(From: LaserguruChris (laserguruchris@aol.com).)
<p>
Believe it or not the chopping does work somewhat for YAG Q-switching although
crude and inefficient. I managed to do this with a CVI YAG max model 95 laser
in an attempt to get green out of it. The green power increased from a
pathetic 70 uW to about 3 mW average power (still poor since it gave about a
couple watts CW at 1,064 nm but better then nothing. :-)  With the doubler
taken out you could focus the beam enough to make little sparks where it hit.
The wheel 1 mm holes cut in the edge separated by 2 mm and was spinning at
55,000 rpm. It is probably extremely difficult to get true Q-switching this
way, what you will most likely get is a Q-switch pulse with a CW level "tail".

<h3><A NAME="ssleoq">Electro-Optic and Acousto-Optic Q-Switching</A></h3>

Rather than having something as crude as a moving part like a rotating mirror
or prism, an electronically activated optical element like a Kerr cell is
mounted between the end of the laser rod and associated cavity mirror.
A delay circuit is then used to open this electronic shutter a precise
time after the flash lamp is triggered.  For continuously pumped SS lasers
(either arc lamp or diode pumped), the Q-switch is activated repetively
producing a quasi-CW output consisting of a series of high peak power
pulses at up to a 10 or 20 kHz rate (for YAG).
<p>
A variety of electro-optic techniques may be used including the Kerr cell
(high voltage driven) which affects the polarization and the Acousto-Optic
type (RF driven) which deflects part of the beam out of the cavity thus
reducing gain.
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
There are three main differences from the optical side between Electro-Optic
(EO) Q-switches (e.g., Pockels Cell) and Acousto-Optic (AO) Q-switches:
<p>
<ol>
<li>With EO, a much higher loss can be achieved. If tuned properly,
 the single-pass loss can approach 100% (I believe, I've never worked
 with them). AOMs can get up to ~80%, but that is either in materials
 with low damage threshold and with a small aperture (~1 mm) or in
 high-power devices which need 50 to 100 W of RF power into the AOM and
 water cooling. Even than, 50 to 60% is more typical.
<p>
<li>EOs can be switched off faster, I believe on the ns scale. In AOMs
 the switching time is determined by the time the acoustic wave needs
 to cross the beam. 6 km/s (i.e. 6 mm/us) is a typical acoustic velocity,
 so that the switching time is about 170 ns per mm beam diameter. That
 can be a problem especially on large systems.
<p>
<li>AOMs can be modulated much faster. While the switching time is
 slow, you can switch on and off as much and fast as you want only
 limited by this switching time. 100s of kHz repetition rate is not a
 problem for the AOM. EOs need a certain recovery time. I think, they
 have improved this, but the old-fashioned devices were not good for
 more than a few 100 Hz.
</ol>
<p>
An additional advantage of AOMs is that they require only low
voltages.
<p>
From the above, you can easily see why EO was used for low-rep-rate
flashlamp-pumped systems with 10s of Hz rep rate but with a very high
gain so that fast switching and good loss is important. On continuously
lamp-pumped system with high-rep-rate (multi-kHz) and on diode-pumped
systems, the AOM is normally the better choice.

<h3><A NAME="ssloqs">Optical/Passive Q-Switching</A></h3>

Fully optical or passive Q-switch techniques exploit the non-linear properties
of certain materials called "saturable absorbers".  Below a specific
threshold, these block the (incoherent) light and prevent laser oscillations
from building up in the resonator just like a rotating mirror or prism that
isn't aligned with the cavity or a Kerr cell in the off state.  However, at
some point, the material becomes transparent and the laser pulse can form.
The result is a very short (possibly sub-nanosecond) length output pulse.
The saturable absorber then returns to its absorbing state and if the pumping
continues, the process will repeat generating a series of short pulses.  This
can be used to provide a means of easily controlling the pulse rate of a diode
or arc lamp pumped laser with excellent consistency of pulse energy (since the
Q-switch only activates when its threshold is reached).  Since no complex
mechanical and/or electronic systems are involved, this is a nice approach,
especially for compact lower power systems.  However, I don't know how the
overall efficiency compares to that of an active approach.

<h3><A NAME="sslpecd">Pulse Energy Considerations in Q-Switched DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

Unlike a flashlamp pumped Q-switched SS laser where a huge amount of energy
can be dumped into the laser medium in a short time, a typical DPSS laser
must contend with a more modest pump diode or diodes which cannot be run at
more than their CW ratings.  So, the peak power in the Q-switched pulse(s)
is closely tied to the diode power and the same power is required whether
the repetition rate is 1 pulse per hour or several kHz (though the cooling
requirements do differ).
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
As a rule of thump, the maximum energy you will get from a continuously
pumped laser is Tau x P_cw. Tau is the upper laser level lifetime and
P_cw is the CW power you get from the same laser when operated CW, not
pulsed. The best performance from a continuously pumped Nd laser will
be achieved with Nd:YLF, since Tau = 530 us in Nd:YLF (compared to 230
in Nd:YAG and 100 in Nd:YVO4). Using this theory, a laser which
delivers 1 W cw could achieve 530 uJ with Nd:YLF, 230 uJ with Nd:YAG
and 100 uJ with Nd:YVO4. The pulse energy will not really change for
repetition rates below half the inverse lifetime, i.e. ~1 khz for
Nd:YLF, ~2 kHz for Nd:YAG and ~5 kHz for Nd:YVO4.

<h2>Frequency Changers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="sslfrq">Frequency Multiplication</A></h3>

To obtain visible beams from neodymium doped lasers requires some process to
convert the 1064 nm beam to a shorter wavelength.  One way of doing this is to
pass the beam through another crystal which responds in a nonlinear way
to the intense IR radiation.  From basic system theory, one learns that
doing anything nonlinear to a pure sinusoidal signal will result in frequency
components in the output at multiples (harmonics) of the original.  There are
a number of materials which have this property and are suitable for use with
the 1064 nm wavelength.
<p>
Solid state lasers may use frequency multiplication to generate the second
harmonic (double or SHG), third harmonic (triple or THG), forth harmonic
(quadruple or FHG), and even higher harmonics, though conversion efficiency
generally goes down with increasing multiplication factor.  The basic doubled
solid state laser uses a three step process to obtain green 532 nm light from
electrical power:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A light source provides a high flux of IR radiation from an electrical
 (usually) source.  This may be a flash lamp or high power diode laser or
 diode laser array (bar).  A wavelength of around 800 nm is used to match an
 absorption band in the lasing medium.
<p>
<li>The IR pumps a Neodymium doped crystal which is the actual lasing medium
 producing coherent 1,064 nm (near IR) light (e.g., Nd:YAG or
 Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>).  Nd:YAG has largely been replaced with
 Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> in small lasers of this type (e.g., laser pointers)
 because the latter is more efficient.
<p>
<li>The 1,064 nm light is applied to a KTP (Potassium Titanyl Phosphate,
 KTiOPO<sub>4</sub>) crystal which when excited with intense 1,064 nm light,
 produces some output at twice its frequency - half the wavelength - 532 nm.
 This is the result of the nonlinear interaction of the E/M radiation with
 the crystal lattice.  Other types of crystals can be used for frequency
 tripling and possibly even quadrupling.  So, there are DPSSFT (THG) and
 DPSSFQ (FHG) types as well. :-)  These processes can also be done serially.
</ul>
<p>
However, just pointing an CW IR laser at a KTP crystal is not an efficient way
of getting this to work.  The laser and doubler crystals are usually both
inside the cavity (this is called intracavity doubling).  The mirrors are
designed to have high reflectivity in the IR and to be transparent at 532 nm.
So, 1064 nm IR photons bounce back and forth until they are finally convinced
to double their frequency and become 532 nm green photons.  They then find it
easy to escape from the prison. :-)
See the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped
Solid State Lasers</A> for more information on this specific technology.
<p>
High energy pulsed lasers can be frequency multiplied directly (outside
the cavity) and it is possible to buy an external unit to place in the
beam to do this.  Aiming the SSY1 pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser's output at a
KTP crystal will result in relatively efficient doubling because it it's
peak power is very high.  However, this isn't practical for low power CW
lasers.
<p>
And as to your next question, almost any laser can be doubled (or more) but
it comes down to a matter of efficiency and cost.  For example, with a
HeNe laser, it's possible to easily get a few watts of intracavity power
inside a long HeNe laser if both mirrors are high reflectors.  Even a
modestly long one-Brewster laser tube with super polished mirrors can
result in 10s of watts.  The record may be on the order of 100 W for
a reasonable size HeNe laser.  In principle, you can put a non-linear crystal
in there with a couple of lenses or a lens with one of the mirrors having
appropriate curvature to produce a small beam waist inside the crystal.
Argon and krypton ion lasers can have even higher intracavity power.
All of these as well as diode lasers have been doubled.  Whether it's
useful and economical is another matter.

<h4><A NAME="sslmond">Monolithic DPSSFD Lasers</A></h4>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
Monolithic laser systems, typically small DPSS doubled Nd:YAG or
Nd:YV0<sub>4</sub> systems can be made in one or two ways: They can be
assembled or they can be 'grown' in a single boule and sliced up to form
microcavity lasers.  One must keep in mind that the cavity is very small in
these lasers - on the order of a couple of millimeters. Thus, they are very
insensitive to misalignment of both the optics and the SHG crystal.  A
small cheap DPSS (not even a monolithic DPSS, but one with discrete
components) may have the optics glued to an assembly or otherwise simply
held in place.  Gone are the fine adjustments of the traditional laser cavity.
All monolithic DPSS systems are low output power, so cooling is not a huge
concern. If the system is cooled, however, obviously all the optical elements
are at the same temperature. This is completely contrary to the norm found in
higher power DPSS systems, where the KTP (or other SHG) is normally at an
elevated temperature and the lasing crystal is simply at a stabilized room
temperature.

<h4><A NAME="sslsrgs">Selecting Type and Size of SHG Crystal</A></h4>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
The required type and size of a the non-linear crystal depends on your
application.
<p>
If you want to do frequency doubling (SHG - Second Harmonic Generation) of
a CW or quasi-CW beam them a KTP crystal with a 3 x 3 mm aperture will suffice
up to about 70 or 80 W of extracted green output power.  If you are looking
for higher powers use a 5 x 5 mm crystal and a respectively bigger beam waist.
This will give you enough room for outputs of several hundreds of watts, and is
the crystal size used in the current record holding laser for most green
output power.
<p>
If you are thinking of using a SHG crystal for a pulsed laser, KDP would
actually be your best bet.  As a general rule of thumb with a electro-optically
Q-switched laser, you want the spot size on your SHG no smaller than your
output beam diameter.  As it is extremely expensive to get a large KTP crystal,
KDP is often used, and with high power pulsed lasers, the lower nonlinear
coefficient is not noticed.
<p>
The damage threshold for a normal KTP crystal is 100 to 500 megawatts per
square centimeter.  The efficiency increases as the power density increases, so
the power output at the second harmonic increases exponentially as the power
density increases.  However, although it is true that the damage threshold is
very high in terms of power, it is much lower in terms of energy.  Damage can
occur at tens of joules per square cm.  That's one reason why large doubled
YAGs like the Laserscope systems can't be gated with the Q-switch driver.  At
high repetition rates, the first pulse supression goes isn't effective in
those lasers, so the energy goes up in the first pulse eating the optics,
normally starting with the KTP.
<p>
LBO has a much lower nonlinear coefficient for 1064 nm SHG than KTP.  However,
it also have a much higher damage threshold. LBO is normally only used in
systems that either (1) use very high powers (i.e., 100 W class lasers) or
(2) need one of the optical properties of the crystal, such as the small
angular acceptance angle.  Since LBO has a lower nonlinear coefficient, it
requires the use of a much longer crystal.
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
In selecting between KTP and LBO for a CW laser, I would say there is one
simple reason: Gray tracking.
<p>
Have a look at <A HREF="http://www.raicol.com//">Raicol
Crystals</A>.  Go to "Products", then "High Gray Track Resistance (HGTR) KTP
for CW and high average power SHG".  On the right of that page, there
is an image to click on.  That give a graph for flux-grown KTP,
hydrothermal KTP, and for the Raicol HGTR KTP. I phoned them recently
and I think they said that their HGTR KTP is the best you can get.  (Does
this statement surprise you? --- Sam.) And still, it can handle only up to
10 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> of green power density, and that reliably only if you
keep it warm. 
<p>
For a laser like the Coherent Verdi, with an output between 5 and 10 W
CW.  To keep that below 10 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the beam area has to be at least
1/1000 cm<sup>2</sup> or 0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>.  That is roughly a beam diameter
of 1/3 mm, not very small for a laser where you want to focus tighter to get
good conversion. And that's operating at the limit.  I would guess that
Coherent would prefer to have some margin there. LBO doesn't have such
a problem - you can focus as tight as you wish. The coatings are going
to be a problem, if you go too tight, but not damage to the crystal (at
least not anywhere near this value).
<p>
The problem with LBO is that if you use it at room temperature, you
need to use "critical phase matching".  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslpmhg">Phase Matching for Harmonic Generation</A>.)
When critically phase matched, LBO has a large walk-off and small
acceptance angle, both not what you want when you need to focus
tightly for CW conversion. But you can use LBO also in "non-critical
phase matching". Then, you have to temperature tune it to ~150 &deg;C
and stabilise it there to better then 1 &deg;C. The advantage of
non-critical phase matching is no walk-off and a large acceptance angle,
so that you can now really focus tightly.
<p>
The other disadvantage of LBO is that its non-linearity is much
smaller than that of KTP. You need much larger pieces to get a
comparable conversion efficiency, and it is significantly more
expensive as well. In addition, there is a Chinese company holding US
and other patents for it, so it cannot be purchased easily from
others if you are in the USA or want to produce a commercial laser,
which you intend to sell in the US market in any significant numbers.
<p>
We have just ordered two LBO crystals for non-critical phase matching,
which we will use to intracavity-double our 23 W Nd:YLF laser. We will
see how much we can get with them. I am still thinking to buy one of
the Raicol KTPs as well, just to see how far we can get with them. I
haven't decided on that yet.
<p>
(From: Skywise (skywise@cwixmail.com).)
<p>
My copy of Casix's "Crystals and Materials Laser Accessories" lists beta Barium
Borate as having been used to generate second, third, fourth, and fifth
harmonics of Nd lasers. But KTP is more efficient than BBO for this purpose.

<h4><A NAME="ssldfmp">Discussion of the Harmonic Generation Process</A></h4>

(From: Martin Poyser.)
<p>
My thoughts so far are as follows: Assume that the input to the
non-linear crystal is a sinusoid with a frequency of several 10<sup>14</sup> Hz
(for visible light). Then assume that the transmittance of the crystal
as a function of the instantaneous value of the input signal (i.e., the
value of the input signal, which varies between +peak_amplitude and
peak_amplitude) is not a straight line, as normal, but rather, a curve,
perhaps resembling a log curve, or, curving with the opposite sign, an
exponential curve. Then, the signal emerging from the crystal would be
distorted, and no longer a pure sinusoid. Then, taking the Fourier
transform of the output signal, it would no longer approximate a delta
function at the frequency of the input signal, but would contain other
components, including harmonics of the input signal.
<p>
Is this <i>anywhere</i> near the mark, or is it a different process entirely?
<p>
(From: Doug McDonald (mcdonald@scs.uiuc.edu).)
<p>
This is correct. 
<p>
(From: Martin.)
<p>
If my guess is anything like correct, it would seem valid to predict that
the doubling should not be particularly frequency-specific, so one should
be able to use the crystal to double (or triple, etc.) any visible/IR/UV
wavelength more or less equally. Yet, I have not heard of this being done.
I have not heard of doubling the output of an 808nm pump diode directly
(without YAG, etc.) to get UV. This suggests to me that there is strong
wavelength-dependence. If so, why?
<p>
(From: Doug.)
<p>
Now the tricky part. You are thinking like radio frequencies.  At readio
frequencies, the non-linear element (e.g. diode) is small compared to a
wavelength. At optical frequencies it is not. Consider a yagi antenna that has
each element nonlinear.  It won't work for the second harmonic at all, and
will have a vastly different spatial pattern for the third harmonic.
<p>
The point is that the non-linear signals from different parts of the crystal
have to add up in phase, and this is tricky to arrange because the speed of
light is different for different frequencies.  You CAN use most doubler
crystals for different wavelengths, you just have to tilt them. KTP can't be
due to a quirk, and this quirk is why it is so efficient.
<p>
(From: Martin.)
<p>
Also, why do these doubling crystals need such high input power to "get
going"? Is it simply that the non-linearity becomes more noticeable as
the amplitude of the input signal increases, and the transmittance
curve deviates further from linearity? 
<p>
(From: Doug.)
<p>
Yes.
<p>
(From: Martin.)
<p>
Is there a well-defined threshold amplitude (or input power) at which things
suddenly start happening, or does the amplitude of Nth harmonic light increase
gradually with increasing input power?
<p>
(From: Doug.) 
<p>
Thre is no threshold - the output of a doubler crystal is quite "quadratic" up
to saturation.
<p>
(From: Martin.)
<p>
Finally, are tripling/quadrupling crystals made specially as such, or are
the same crystals used as for doubling, with the required harmonic selected
by intra or post-resonator filtering?
<p>
(From: Doug.)
<p>
They have to be cut at different angles to get the phase right

First of all, within reason a frequency doubler can be found for any
wavelength in question. it's really only a matter of optical transparency at
the wavelengths in question, as well as the nonlinear coefficient.  There has
been some direct doubling of diode laser light.  Spectra Diode Labs doubled
roughly 900 nm light to get 450 nm. But in order to do this they needed to
take the output of a beam conditioned laser diode to a tapered laser
amplifier to get a high quality beam that could be manages optically and
focused int he SHG crystal. The only reason why you don't see this happen a lot
is because the light coming from a laser diode is a PAIN to deal with, and
for efficient SHG you need a very good quality beam (at least compared to
most laser diodes).  The nonlinear efficiency of ANY material increases with
power squared - that is the reason why efficient SHG requires a lot of power.
People who have been hit in the eye with a high power pulsed YAG laser have
reported seeing a flash of green light (normally the last thing they have
seen with that eye).  This is because the vitreous humor acts as a nonlinear
element at very high powers.  All materials have a nonlinear coefficient, it's
just like an index of refraction, but in this case it is power, as well as
wavelength dependent. An ultra high power laser can cause air to act as a
nonlinear medium.  There is no magic power threshold that SHG processes start
at.  MOST harmonic crystals are cut for phase matching of a particular
process, such as doubling, at a particular wavelength.  It is possible to use
a 'generic' crystal for any nonlinear process, but efficiency suffers
dramatically.  A 3rd harmonic crystal is cut for mixing of fundamental and the
second harmonic from a doubling crystal. a 4th harmonic crystal is cut for
phase matching the SHG process of the 2nd harmonic of a laser, and so on.

KTP is not suitable for doubling to the blue spectrum (it can't be phase
matched below about 500 nm).  Normally, KNBO<sub>3</sub> is used to double
the 946 nm line of a Nd:YAG or the 914 nm line of Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>. But the
efficiency of these lines is poor (10% in comparison with the 1,064 nm
emission). Some companies make blue lasers by direct doubling a 980 nm diode.
But this is not easy, because you need a very good beam quality which requires
a single mode diode - not available at high power.  The other problem is that
you have to use extra-cavity doubling (since you can't get inside normal
diodes!).  With cheap multimode diodes, there is no way to do the needed
beam shaping.  You can build a nice green laser using 980 nm diodes and
Yb:KGW (1,025 to 1,045 nm; greater than 50% efficiency) and doubling with KTP.
KGW has its major absorption wavelength at 980 nm - the problem is that it is
not cheap (starts from $1,000/crystal). I am currently constructing a blue
laser (457 nm from Nd:YVO4 or 473 nm from Nd:YAG) and I think there will be
some news around the blue lasers next year. Many companies are developing
new materials for powerful blue lasers.

<p>
Consider a loudspeaker's membrane. If you drive the speaker at low volume
with a sine wave a a certain frequency you will get a sound at that
frequency. If you increase the volume (power), at some point the membrane
can't keep up with the harmonic oscillation. You get a distorted sound,
which has many different frequencies, especially harmonic overtones that are
multiples of the basic frequency.
<p>
In a classical interpretation this is what happens in the doubling crystal.
The electrons in the material oscillate in the electric field of the light
wave. If you increase the light intensity the electrons start to oscillate
violently and at some point they no longer follow the nice harmonic
trajectories anymore. That's when other frequencies start to be generated,
because oscillating electrons emit light waves at the frequencies at which
they oscillate.
<p>
The next problem is that if the electrons of the individual atoms generate
frequencies in a random way, not related to each other, all these effects
will cancel out and you don't get anything useful out. Enter phase-matching.
Phase-matching is a way to make sure that all atoms in the crystal work
together to generate the correct frequency. This is done by aligning the
crystal in a certain angle both in respect to the input laser beam and the
doubled output beam.
<p>
The most important point in frequency doubling is that you need a high laser
power (or rather power density) to make the electrons oscillate in a
non-harmonic way. That's why it's difficult to get non-linear effects with
low power lasers such as HeNe and low-power diodes. Another problem is that
the input beam and the frequency-doubled beam are usually not parallel, so
you get a walk-off effect. That means a limited interaction length and that
limits how much of the power you can convert. In theory you can get 100%
conversion if the conditions are the right.
<p>
Generating very short wavelengths is a problem because many materials absorb
at short wavelengths, so even if you can generate doubled light is doesn't
come out of the crystal.

<h4><A NAME="sslpmhg">Phase Matching for Harmonic Generation</A></h4>

To achieve any useful efficiency (or anything at all) from KTP (or any other
non-linear crystal), it must be oriented very precisely with respect to
the incident fundamental beam.  Complex mathematics is needed to fully
analyze or predict this behavior but there is a relatively simple way to
explain it if one is willing to accept certain aspects of E/M and materials
interactions without proof.  Based on these simplifications, it will be
possible to understand why the orientation of KTP and other non-linear
crystals is so important in achieving any reasonable performance. :)
<p>
We deal mainly with second harmonic generation which is a special case of
two beams interacting in a non-linear material to produce the sum of their
frequencies.  In this case, they are actually two components of the same
beam (with a single frequency) so the result is also half their wavelength.
However, the same basic explanation also applies to any non-linear optical
process including optical mixing of two beams (for example, one at the
fundamental and the other at the second harmonic to produce the 3rd harmonic),
OPOs (Optical Parametric Oscillators) and OPAs (Optical Parametric Amplifiers)
to generate a pair of new wavelengths from a single input, and so forth.
<p>
Non-linear optical processes can be either elastic (optical energy conserving)
such as harmonic generation or inelastic (which deposits some energy in the
material) such as Raman or Brillouin scattering.  We only deal with the elastic
case here.
<p>
The following is based on material from "Solid State Laser Engineering" by
Walter Koechner (5th edition) and has been greatly simplified.  See that
book for all the gory details.
<p>
Non-linear optical processes are based on the response of the dielectric
material at the atomic level to the electric fields of an intense light beam.
The propagation of a wave through a material produces changes in the spatial
and temporal distribution of electrical charges as the electrons and atoms
respond to the electromagnetic field, mostly a displacement of the valence
(outer) electrons from their normal orbits.  This perturbation produces
electric dipoles whose macroscopic manifestation is polarization.  For small
field strengths, the polarization is proportional to the electric field.  In
the non-linear case, reradiation comes from dipoles that do not faithfully
reproduce the electric fields that generates them.  The (electrical)
polarization wave resulting from this non-linear behavior includes both the
original frequency or frequencies as well as the sum and difference
frequencies (as with an electronic mixer or other non-linear device).
<p>
Whether a given material reacts in a linear or non-linear way depends on
its basic composition and structure, the intensity and orientation of the
incident wave(s), and their intensity.  For each material, there is a
parameter (which is a function of orientation) known as the "non-linear
coefficient" which determines how sensitive it is for these processes.
(However, just having a high non-linear coefficient doesn't necessarily
make a given material suitable for anything if its damage threshold or some
other property isn't favorable.)
<p>
The non-linear effect makes the conversion efficiency proportional to the
<i>square</i> of the input power until the material saturates.  (Unlike a
lasing process, there is no threshold, just very low effeciency at low
power levels.)  Thus, high peak power is needed to achieve the best
performance.  This explains why pulsed lasers can be easily frequency
doubled using external non-linear crystals but intracavity frequency
doubling is much more effective for CW lasers.
<p>
Second harmonic generation should be viewed as a two step process:
<p>
<ol>
<li>First, the input at the fundamental frequency produces a polarization wave
 in the crystal at the second harmonic as a result of the non-linear behavior
 of the material.  This polarization wave has a phase velocity and wavelength
 in the crystal which is determined by the index of refraction for the
 fundamental wave, n1.
<p>
<li>Second, the energy is transferred from the polarization wave at the second
 harmonic to an E/M wave at the second harmonic - the useful output.  The
 phase velocity and wavelength of the second harmonic are determined by the
 index of refraction for the second harmonic, n2.
</ol>
<p>
For efficient energy transfer, these two waves must remain in phase but for
real world materials, n1 and n2 are generally not equal due to optical
dispersion and the E/M wave will lag behind the polarization wave.  Over very
short distances, this will be slight and the waves will be substantially in
phase.  Output power will flow back and forth between the polarization wave
and the E/M wave along the length of interaction based on this phase mismatch.
One half the period is termed the "coherence length" (not to be confused with
the coherence length of a laser to which it is NOT related).  However, this
coherence length is typically very small resulting in insignificant amounts
of second harmonic power - no more than is produced after one coherence length
no matter how long the crystal is.
<p>
The typical dispersion values in the visible and near-IR of most crystals
limits the coherence length to about 10 um.  Thus, the maximum output power
will be very small.  (If one could stack 10 um thick sections of such a
crystal in alternating fashion, it is possible to get around this limitation
but such a structure would be prohibitively expensive if it could be
fabricated at all.  However, this is the concept of "Periodically Poled"
non-linear crystals - a topic for a future discussion).
<p>
One way around the limited coherence length is to take advantage of the
natural birefringence of some materials.  Birefringence results in slightly
different index of refraction values depending on the direction of
polarization of the wave in the crystal.  If it was possible to arrange the
orientation of the crystal such that the incident (fundamental) and output
(harmonic) beams propagated in just the proper directions such that n1 would
be exactly equal to n2, the coherence length, and thus the power output, could
be greatly increased.  It turns out that materials like KDP, KTP, LBO, BBO, and
LiNbO<sub>3</sub> have suitable dispersion characteristics for phase matching
to be accomplished and high enough non-linear coefficient, damage thresholds,
and other properties to make them useful for harmonic generation as well as
other non-linear optical processes like optical mixing, OPOs, OPAs, etc.
<p>
The math is quite hairy and involved :) but from a practical perspective,
unless you are manufacturing the crystals, there is no need to worry about
the precise angles as the supplier takes care of cutting them so that the
orientation in your optical cavity will be something reasonable -
usually close to the crystal axis being parallel to the resonator axis,
and at either a 90 degree or 45 degree orientation around its axis.
<p>
The "Type" of phase matching relateds to the polarization directions of
the input and output beams:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Type-I phase matching:</b> The polarization vectors of the interacting
 waves are parallel.  The two incident beams (actually a single beam in the
 frequency doubling case) are oriented perpendicular to the optical axis of
 the crystal and the harmonic beam is polarized parallel to the optical axis
 of the crystal.
<p>
<li><b>Type-II phase matching:</b> The polarization vectors of the interacting
 waves are perpendicular.  A single linearly polarized fundamental beam
 may be divided into its o and e polarization components by orienting it at
 45 degrees with respect to the X axis.  The second harmonic beam will be
 polarized parallel to the optical axis of the crystal, 45 degrees from the
 incident beam.
</ul>
<p>
Critical versus non-critical phase matching relates to the angle of the
incident and harmonic beams with respect to the crystal's optical axis:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Critical phase matching:</b> This is when phase matching is
 done at an angle other than 90 degrees to the optical axis of a uniaxial
 crystal.  There will be double refraction and the fundamental and second
 harmonic will not be co-linear with each-other but will diverge slightly
 (beam walk-off).  This will limit the distance within the crystal over
 which the non-linear interaction can occur.  The allowable critical phase
 matching angle variation is also very small.
<p>
<li><b>Non-critical phase matching:</b> This is when phase matching can be
 accomplished at exactly 90 degrees to the optical axis of a uniaxial
 crystal by controlling some parameter like temperature or chemical
 composition of the crystal.  The effect of angular misalignment is also
 much lower in this case (being a function of a quadratic instead of linear
 term in the equation for the phase mismatch, delta-k, should you care!).
</ul>
<p>
Most green (532 nm) DPSS lasers use Type-II critical
phase matching for the KTP.  The KTP crystal has to be oriented at a
45 degree angle to the polarization direction in which the vanadate
produces stimulated radiation for optimal performance (Type-II) and
the KTP crystal's optical axis is at some non-90 degree orientation to
the optical axis of the laser (critical phase matching at 21 degrees
for flux grown KTP or 26 degrees for hydrothermal KTP.  Of course,
this isn't generally apparent to the user since the manufacturer cuts
the KTP so that its faces will be close to perpendicular to the
optical axis of the laser at the optimal phase match orientation.)
See: <A HREF="ktppm.gif">DPSS Laser showing Type-II Phase Matching of
KTP</A>.  The polarization of the pump diode and vanadate are both
vertical when the vanadate is oriented for maximum absorption.  The
1,064 nm light from the vanadate is effectively a pair of orthogonal
components (at +45 degrees and -45 degrees to the vertical) which
interact in the Type-II phase matching process.  The resulting 532 nm
second harmonic is rotated 45 degrees with respect to the 1064 nm
input.  The walk-off angle is 4.5 mR which ultimately limits the
length of interaction - thus a really long KTP crystal won't be
particularly useful.  The non-linear coefficients for Type-I
interactions in KTP are too low to be useful but some other materials
(like KDP) can be cut for either Type-I or Type-II phase matching,
and/or critical or non-critical phase matching depending on the
application.
<p>
Now, it should be noted that many, if not most, DPSS green laser pointers
and other cheap DPSS green lasers do not produce a beam with a high degree
of polarization even though they use vanadate and KTP.
It's not that the KTP (or type II phase matching) is somehow producing
a random polarized output.  The output is polarized if the input is
polarized.  I assume (but don't know for sure) that the problem with
mediocre polarization with pointers and such is that while the vanadate's
gain is orientation sensitive, in conjunction with the orientation dependent
loss in the KTP (due to the green conversion), lasing at the fundamental
frequency is actually multi-longitudinal mode and the modes are at various
orientations.  The Coherent C315M and 532, and the Uniphase uGreen and
Nanolaser are as far as I know, KTP-based.  But they are
all single longitudinal mode with Brewster angle optics to select the
polarization of the fundamental lasing mode.

<h4><A NAME="sslpmaa">Phase Matching Acceptance Angle</A></h4>

(From: Fred Vachss (fvachss@adelphia.net).)
<p>
The acceptance angle refers to the range of angles over which you can
get good phase matching.  In the non-pump depleted regime the output
power varies with sinc(delta-k * L)<sup>2</sup>, where delta-k =
2k(fundamental) - k(SHG) is the phase mismatch term.  For small
deviations dtheta from the proper phase matching angle one can usually
approximate delta-k = const. * dtheta.  This implies that the
acceptance angle, i.e. the range of angles over which the argument of
the sinc**2 function is less than unity, will vary with 1/L.  In other
words, acceptance angle * L is constant - hence the functional form
you saw in your text.
<p>
To determine how tightly you should focus your beam you need to
determine the intensity and interaction length you need to get the
desired conversion efficiency.  Then focus tightly enough so that your
intensity is at the desired level, but not so much so that your
Raleigh range is less than the desired interaction length.  If you
can't do this then you need better beam quality, or more powerful
laser or a material with a higher nonlinear coefficient.

<h4><A NAME="sslicfm">Intra-Cavity Versus External Frequency
 Multiplication</A></h4>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
The NIF, NOVA, and all the lasers previous to them in the Inertial Confinement
Fusion (ICF) programs around the world use external frequency conversion.
That's the only way multiply the wavelength of the light from a Master
Oscillator - Power Amplifier (MOPA) type laser (you can't multiply the
wavelength and than pass the light through the amplifiers because there is
no amplifying medium that works at the shorter wavelengths).  But here again,
the flux is orders of magnitude greater even extra cavity than one deals with
for CW sources, especially compared to DPSS lasers.  The ICF lasers are run so
'hard' that the optical flux is near the damage threshold, in some cases
upwards of 100s of megawatts per square centimeter.  As all nonlinear
processes have efficiencies based closely on power squared, obviously a 100 MW
beam will be doubled much more effectively than a 5 watt beam inside a DPSS
laser 5 mm in diameter.  That is why solid state lasers get doubled
<b>intra-cavity</b> - it greatly increases the power flux at the crystal.
In fact, a lot of intra-cavity doubling schemes rely on focusing the beam
down at the crystal to make the flux even higher.  This is something that
would be difficult with diodes due to their poor focusability resulting
from their large divergence.

<h4><A NAME="sslcmed">Converting a Medical Laser YAG to SHG Operation</A></h4>

(From: Curt Graber (cgraber@fwi.com).)
<p>
The re-engineering of a medical system is something that is a daunting 
task typically only for those somewhat versed in NLO systems However
with perseverance and much time invested YOU should succeed in the quest
and more importantly increase your understanding and knowledge of the
NLO systems and their unique quirks......
<p>
Any arclamp (CW pumped) YAG system is a viable option for a L-fold or
Z-fold NLO system , medical systems are great base line systems for many
reasons - they are plentiful, cost effective, and well engineered.
<p>
The subsystems needed to typically convert on of these units are as follows:

<ol>
<li>NEOS or other brand Q-switch RF driver and module capable of 25+
watts of RF output and AR coated for 1064 and 532 nm (higher power units
such as 50 to 100 watt pump lasers and higher will require more RF power to
"hold off" the intracavity energy.
<p>
<li>3-axis KTP oven and TE-driver assembly to allow the heating of the
crystal to it's unique peak efficiency temperature which will be used to
tune the crystal specifically.
<p>
<li>A KTP crystal - 3 x 3 x 5 mm is typical however other dimensions are
available as well , a side note on the crystals is that ALL KTP material
varies in performance - the best material is only available from Litton
Airtron.  This is highly grey tack resistant and capable of rather
high power because of it's inherent high damage threshold.  On the other
hand the cheap KTP material from overseas suppliers is not capable of high
power (typically less than 1 watt)/
<p>
<li>Optics and optics mounts needed for a complete system
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="sslopos">Optical Parametric Oscillators</A></h3>

Optical Parametric Oscillation (OPO) is a nonlinear process in which a single
input laser beam or 'pump' beam is converted into two lower-energy beams known
as the 'signal' beam and the 'idler' beam. This nonlinear process enables a
fixed wavelength laser beam to be converted into other wavelengths.
<p>
The wavelengths/frequencies of the three beams must satisfy:
<PRE>
                      1                 1                  1
                -------------- = ---------------- + ---------------
                 Lambda(Pump)     Lambda(Signal)     Lambda(Idler)
</PRE>
or equivalently:
<PRE>
               Frequency(Pump) = Frequency(Signal) + Frequency(Idler)
</PRE>
Energy is conserved since this also says that the sum of the energies of the
Signal and Idler photons must equal that of the Pump photon.  (The energy of a
photon is proportional to its frequency.)
<p>
Unlike lasers using frequency multiplication to obtain shorter wavelengths
where the frequencies of the pump and output are related by small integers
(SHG=2, THG=3, FHG=4, etc. - see the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps1">Frequency Multiplication of DPSS Lasers</A>),
with OPOs there is NO explicit requirement that the wavelengths of either of
the resulting beams be related directly to the wavelength of the pump beam as
long as they satisfy the equations, above.  Thus, it is possible to implement
a laser capable of being continuously tuned over a wide range of wavelengths -
as much as several um - by adjustments only of the OPO (not the pump laser).
<p>
Also note that while we use the term 'pump' to describe the input source, an
OPO is NOT a laser in itself - there is no stimulated emission taking place,
just conversion of wavelengths through non-linear optical processes.
<p>
In current OPO devices, the wavelengths that can be generated are limited by
the availability of nonlinear materials that can simultaneously satisfy
the phase-matching, energy conservation and optical transmission conditions.
<p>
The output wavelengths of current OPO's are controlled with angle or
temperature tuning of the refractive indicies.  Tuning by angle results in
restricted angular acceptance and walk-off, which restricts the interaction
length and reduces the efficiency of converting small pulse energy
beams. Temperature tuning is generally restricted to relatively small
wavelength ranges.

<h3><A NAME="sslnliq">Non-Linear Optical Effects in Liquids?</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
You can get non linear processes to happen in various liquids. I have seen
water operate as a non-linear medium before. but the problem is that the
efficiency of using such materials is so ridiculously low that you need e very
powerful laser to see any results.  You can forget about doubling any
800 or 900 nm laser diode.  If on the other hand you would like to double a
high power Ti:Sapphire laser, yup you can do it.  Only problem is since water
and other liquids do not have a rigid structure, you can't exactly phase
match whatever non-linear process you want.  So what ends up happening is
a lot of non-linear processes at the same time with varying (low) efficiencies
and you get something along the lines of continuum generation - white light.

<h3><A NAME="sslnlec">Non-Linear Crystals Environmental Considerations</A></h3>

Fortunately, KTP is a stable material.  However, many others require
special handling, storage, and mounting to avoid degradation due to
moisture.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
Many non-linear crystals other than KTP are hydroscopic.  However, they are
only slightly hydroscopic.  To give you an idea, KDP, KTA, and the like,
when stored in even a modesty dry room will crumble away into mush over
a long period of time.  LBO on the other hand will show no sign of wear
unless there are significant scratches on the coating, as the dielectric
coating protects the polished face (the raw polished face will haze over
time if not stored with desicant) but the bulk of the LBO will show little
or no sign of water damage.  LBO has been used with a lot of success without
any type of desicant.  For example, I have a Laser Photonics medical YAG
that used LBO.  The date of manufacture was 1996 as I recall and the crystal
shows no sign of damage, even though it is not in a sealed holder and the
laser head contained no desicant.  KDP obviously is normally stored under
oil.  CLBO is a bit more hydroscopic than LBO.  However, I don't know what
kind of stability properties BBO has but from what I understand they are
similar to LBO.

<h2>Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="ssldps0">What are DPSS Lasers?</A></h3>

Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) lasers are a variation of the well known ruby,
Nd:YAG, or other type of optically pumped crystal based laser where a high
power IR laser diode or array of laser diodes provides the excitation instead
of a flashlamp or other intense light source.  Note that many DPSS lasers are
designed for SHG (Second Harmonic, 532 nm green for a YAG lasing medium) or
higher frequency multiplication but this is not inherent in the DPSS
designation.
<p>
While DPSS lasers generally can't achieve the same <i>peak</i> power as their
flashlamp pumped cousins, they are capable of high CW or average power and
are much more efficient (20 times or more) than flashlamp or arc lamp pumped
SS lasers.  Applications for DPSS lasers include most of those previously
handled by lamp pumped SS lasers as well as many new ones where size and
efficiency are important.  These include most of those for lamp pumped SS
lasers like materials processing as well as graphic arts, and entertainment
(light shows, laser TV, etc.), and many more.  Output power ranges from a few
mW for green DPSS laser pointers to more than a kilowatt for industrial DPSS
lasers - and that upper limit is climbing as you read this. :)
<p>
In more detail:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Conventional solid state lasers are most often pumped by powerful
  flashlamps similar to the electronic flash in your pocket camera but much
  much larger.  The storage capacitors for these may be bathtub size!  By far
  the largest such laser of this type can be found at the
  <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</A>.
  See <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/str/Remington.html">NOVA Laser
  Experiments</A>.  This facility is/was used for research on inertial
  confinement fusion (for possible
  electric power generation, always about 20 years away!) among other things.
  Output energy is up to 100 K joules at 1053 nm or 40 KJ at 527 nm or 351 nm
  (see below) for this football field size laser.  Peak beam power in each
  pulse is as high as 120 Terawatts!
<p>
  NOVA will be dwarfed by the laser at the
  <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/">National Ignition
  Facility</A> (also part of LLNL) currently under construction.  Its output
  energy will be over 1.8 M joules per pulse with a peak power over 500
  Terawatts fed from 192 individual beamlines!  The excuse for funding this
  laser is to be able to simulate/test/evaluate/whatever the performance of
  nuclear weapons since live testing is no longer permitted by treaty and to
  perform further research in inertial confinement fusion.  However, we all
  know that the real reason to build such a huge machine is to provide new and
  bigger fun toys for the laser scientists and engineers!
<p>
<li>DPSS lasers use a high power laser diode pump source.  The wavelength of
  the pump diodes is selected to match an absorption line in the lasing
  medium.  (For Nd:YAG and Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, this is around 800 nm.)
  Therefore, this pumping technique can be much more efficient than using a
  broadband source like a xenon flashlamp.
<p>
  Although there are other materials that can be pumped using laser diodes,
  with our present technology it is not yet feasible to use ruby as the main
  absorption bands for ruby crystal are at 404 nm (blue) and 554 nm (green).
  Laser diodes - high power or otherwise - that operate at these wavelengths
  are not yet commercially available.  Well, OK, there is the Nichia violet
  laser diode at around 400 nm but at $2K a pop for 5 mW, this isn't really
  a viable option.  Ruby. being a 3 level lasing medium, further complicates
  matters.
<p>
  Single laser diodes can generate a few W; for higher power, arrays or bars
  consisting many laser diodes side-by-side are required.  In this way,
  hundreds or even thousands of watts of pump power can be generated in a very
  compact space and directed precisely to where it is needed.  DPSS systems
  outputting over 1 kW average power (several kW of laser diode pump
  power) are now available and announcements of increasingly higher power
  systems are being made almost daily.
<p>
  I know what you are thinking: A few W or even 1 kW isn't as impressive as
  100 TW but at least these lasers fit on a table-top and plug into a standard
  power outlet - they are not the size of an entire football STADIUM with
  electric power requirements to match. :-)  The NIF laser does use some DPSS
  type preamplifiers in the early portion of each beamline and will be
  converting over to DPSS technology for later stages of the amplifier chain
  in the future.
</ul>
The most common DPSS lasers use a crystal doped with Neodymium (Nd) - either
Nd:YAG (Yittrium Aluminum Garnet which is
Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>),) or Nd:YV0<sub>4</sub>
(Nd:Yttrium OrthoVanadate) which
lases at around 1064 nm - in the near IR region of the spectrum.  Compared to
many other solid state laser mediums, Nd, has a relatively low pumping
threshold (in a relative sort of way) so it requires less pumping energy and
is thus more efficient compared to ruby, for example.

<h3><A NAME="ssldps1">Frequency Multiplication of DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

To obtain visible beams from Neodymium doped lasers requires some process to
convert the 1064 nm beam to a shorter wavelength.  One way of doing this is to
pass the beam through another crystal which responds in a nonlinear way
to the intense IR radiation.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslfrq">Frequency Multiplication</A> for an introduction.
<p>
The DPSSFD approach is used in many modern high power visible lasers producing
up to 10 or more watts of output.  For many applications, this solid state
alternative is rapidly replacing bulky, cumbersome, high maintenance, power
hungry, argon ion lasers.  The same performance that used to require a 230 VAC
three-phase 30 A feed can now be obtained from a laser that plugs into an
ordinary 115 VAC outlet.
<p>
Single high power laser diodes (0.5 to 1 watt or so) have made the compact
green laser pointer possible.  Until direct injection blue and green laser
diodes become commercially available at affordable prices, this is the
technique used to create green laser pointers (except possibly for a rare
green HeNe laser pointer - don't how many of there were ever produced).  (See
the section: <A HREF="laserdio.htm#dioabg">Availability of Green, Blue, and
Violet Laser Diodes?</A>.)  However, compared to red laser pointers, these
things eat power so getting significant operating time from a set of batteries
is quite a challenge.  Typical power requirements may be: 400 mA at 3 V -
tough on AAA batteries!

<h3><A NAME="sslepsp">End-Pumping Versus Side Pumping of a DPSS Laser</A></h3>

Low power DPSS systems shine the diode light through the crystal from the rear
(through the cavity HR mirror which will be AR coated for the pump wavelength).
This allows the pump beam to be shaped so that it closely matches the desired
mode volume in the laser crystal.  But end-pumping isn't very scalable.  The
light focused on to the crystal is normally absorbed very quickly (if the
pump wavelength matches an absorption band as it should), so if pump power
density is too high, thermal fracture of the crystal will occur.
<p>
With side-pumping, laser diodes are arranged radially around the rod, just as
in a flashlamp or arc lamp pumped system.  Such lasers have been built as
large at 1,000 WATTS of IR and 300 WATTS of green out of a single rod.  The
maximum for an end-pumped system is around 30 W of IR and 10 W of green.
There are some high power lasers that are end pumped, but the light isn't
focused too sharply.  Such a system is rather lossy, but is quite compact.

<h3><A NAME="ssldps1a">Comments on the Materials in DPSSFD Laser</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> is considered better by some, but only for the lower power
applications (<10W) because it has a lower threshold and a broader absorption
spectrum, thus ensuring better coupling of the pump energy.  It also has
better birefringant properties.  But on the other hand, it has less thermal
conductivity than YAG and is not as physically strong a material and thus has
a lower maximum pump power.  Also, since it is a new crystal, individual and
lot quantity quality control is a concern. And yes, it does lase at 1064 nm.
<p>
Nonlinear crystals can be made up of just about anything.  All other things
being equal, the nonlinear coefficient determines how good a doubler it is.
At high enough energy densities, you can get air to act as a nonlinear medium
(on an interesting note, for the unfortunate few that has witnessed this, the
vitreous humor in the eye can act as a frequency doubler for high power YAG
pulses).  There are other issues behind why a particular crystal might be
chosen including acceptance angle, the spectrum of efficient transmission
through bulk crystal, damage threshold, etc.
<p>
Finally, there are several different ways of producing a frequency doubling
crystal, noncritical, and critical phase matching. In critical, the physical
properties of the crystal are specified for efficient doubling at a particular
frequency (i.e., the crystal is cut in a particular orientation for efficient
doubling). In non critical, either a tuning angle or temperature is used to
provide efficient frequency doubling at a particular wavelength.  More
recently, quasi-critical phase matching has been demonstrated in periodically
poled crystals, but to my knowledge, this technique has not yet made it to the
main stream commercial laser product yet.

<h3><A NAME="ssldps2">Why Laser Diodes are Not Frequency Doubled
 Directly</A></h3>

Since reasonably high power laser diodes operating at around 1060 nm (similar
to what is produced from Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> pumped by 808 nm laser
diode) are commercially available, why aren't these used to pump the KTP
frequency doubling crystal directly?  It would seem that this could save
cost and dramatically boost efficiency by bypassing the intermediate step.
<p>
There are some commercial direct-doubled systems.  These almost invariably
use Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) or KTP (PPKTP) and are generally
quite limited in output power.
<p>
In fact efficiency is usually terrible even with the special SHG crystals.
Here are several reasons why:
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to phase match the beam from a diode laser directly to a
 doubling crystal and both stability and efficiency suffer greatly.
<p>
<li>Since doubling efficiency is non-linear function of power density, using
 the smallest beam waist that doesn't result in crystal damage will produce
 the most doubled power.  Getting a small beam waist over any distance from
 a high power laser diode is all but impossible.
<p>
 (From: Andy Grant (andrew.grant@ffei.co.uk).)
<p>
 Laser diodes have a broad linewidth, and the centre wavelength is strongly
 dependent on temperature. This means that you would not get good phase
 matching to the doubler crystal and the process would be very inefficient.
<p>
 By coupling an 808 nm LD into Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> you obtain an output at
 1,064 nm which is vastly improved in terms of the LD performance described
 above. The Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> is effectively acting as a mode converter. Phase
 matching is thus more efficient and a higher 532 nm power output is obtained.
<p>
<li>Without using an expensive external cavity diode laser, intra-cavity
 doubling would not be possible (or at least would be a lot more difficult) if
 a KTP crystal were pumped directly.  Using the Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>
 rod or block with mirrors that reflect 1064 nm but transmit 532 nm is
 essential in getting any significant efficiency or power output from a
 small DPSSFD laser.  The NIF laser at Livermore may be able to get away
 without it but not your little green laser pointer!
</ul>
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
There are just too many variables in determining output efficiency of an
extra-cavity doubler.  These include the length of the crystal, if it is
pulsed (either low rep rate or quasi-CW), if you have an external cavity, the
type of kTP you use, if it's temperature controlled, and the size of the beam.
I took a piece of plain old ordinary KTP a few minutes ago and put it in front
of a 30 W YAG laser, with a 4 mm diameter beam, and I got about only 170 mW
out. not great efficiency!!!

<h3><A NAME="sslafgl">A First Generation Green Laser Pointer</A></h3>

The earliest green DPSSFD laser pointers were built with discrete components
(vanadate including HR, KTP, OC, etc.) mounted on what is esssentially a
microminiature optical bench shown in <A HREF="dpss1.gif">Organization of
Basic Green DPSS Lasers</A> (upper left).  More modern cost reduced versions
may combine many of these into a hybrid module (upper right) and some may
also include the pump diode.  With such a degree of integration, if any part
goes bad, it would be impossible to replace.  Those with discrete separate
components are more fun because (with a lot of work), the crystals and optics
can be removed and remounted on home-built adjustable mounts for your lasing
pleasure. :)  (Although I call them "first generation", some fancy models
being sold today use exactly the same construction probably because the
beam quality can be better controlled with the discrete optics.)
<p>
A very detailed sequence of photos of all the blood (green) and guts
of one of these first generation units can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.47 or
higher) under "Dissection of Green Laser Pointer".  See
<A HREF="grnorg1.jpg">Internal Organs of Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A> for
an annotated photo of the major components.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="l54-101.gif">Edmund Scientific L54-101 Green DPSS Laser
Pointer</A> for a detailed diagram of a pointer with the identical DPSS
module as the one in the photos (also described in more detail in the
section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssleslp">The Edmund Scientific Model L54-101
Green Laser Pointer</A>).
<p>
The DPSS laser module is almost certainly of Far East origin.  One supplier
of modules that from outside appearance look physically identical is
<A HREF="http://www.enlight-tech.com/">Enlight Technologies, Inc.</A>,
This particular DPSS module would be one of the "-B" versions of the
<A HREF="http://www.enlight-tech.com/product_pglvi.html">PGL-VI Series</A>.
The pointer modules of Enlight are from
<A HREF="http://www.cnilaser.com/">Changchun New Industries
Optoelectronics Tech. Co. Ltd.</A>, a laser
company in mainland China.  But the pointers are manufactured by
<A HREF="http://www.limate.com/">Limate Corporation</A> in
Taiwan.  Both Enlight and Deharpport are importers.
<p>
Here are the specifications as best as I can determine them) for the major
components:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pump:</b> Laser diode chip (dimensions unknown, probably 0.5 x 0.5
 mm or less) mounted on heatsink.  There are no correction optics - the diode
 is positioned nearly in contact with the vanadate to couple the smallest
 possible pump beam into the crystal.
<p>
<li><b>Vanadate:</b> 2 x 3 x 0.5 mm microchip glued to copper disk.
 Rear: HR at 1064, HT at 808 nm; Front: AR at 1064 nm.  Both surfaces planar.
<p>
<li><b>KTP:</b> 2 x 2 x 3 mm AR coated (assume for 1064 nm and 532 nm)
 both ends glued to cutout in brass disk at 45 degree angle.
<p>
<li><b>Cavity dimensions:</b> About 7 mm between mirrors.
<p>
<li><b>OC:</b> HR at 1064 nm (rear), AR (both surfaces) at 532 nm.  Curved
 to form long radius hemispherical cavity, exact focal length unknown.
 No adjustments possible in original mount.
<p>
<li><b>Output optics:</b> Expanding lens, IR filter, and collimating lens.
</ul>
<p>
The power source is a CR2, 3 V, lithium battery.  A regulated pulsed driver
produces a squarewave output at about 4.5 kHz (at 3 V input).  Using a laser
diode simulator (2 silicon diodes and a 0.1 ohm resistor in series), I
measured a peak current of about 0.3 A or an average current of 0.15 A.
However, since the test circuit isn't quite the same as a real laser diode,
these values may not be quite accurate (if anything, the current would be
slightly high).  There is a pot to adjust laser diode current.  The squarewave
frequency varies slightly with battery voltage but as far as I can tell, the
duty cycle and diode current remain constant which means that the perceived
output of the pointer will also have a constant average brightness, though it
will of course, be pulsed.  The circuit for the driver can be found in the
section: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsglp2">Laser Diode Driver from Green Laser
Pointer 2 (GLP-LD2)</A>.  However, the IC it uses is still unidentified.
<p>
Green pointers using this DPSS module output either a CW or high duty cycle
(typically 50 percent) pulsed beam depending on the drive to the laser diode.
However, some other models operate quasi-CW using a passive Q-switch
(sometimes called FRQS - Free Running Q-Switch).  Both these techniques (or
a combination) are used to achieve higher efficiency in the lasing and
non-linear frequency doubling process.  Speaking of which....

<h3><A NAME="ssltbef">Techniques to Improve the Efficiency of a Green DPSS
 Laser Pointer</A></h3>

Many, if not most (newer at least) green DPSS laser pointers are designed to
produce a pulsed output beam.  There is no functional advantage to the pulsed
system (it's actually less desirable since the spot breaks up into dots when
swept over a screen) but it can be made much more efficient reducing the need
for thermal management and extending battery life at the same perceived
brightness for these current hogs.  Quasi-CW pointers may use either a pulsed
pump diode, a passive Q-switch (sometimes called FRQS - Free Running
Q-Switch), or both, to improve the efficiency.
<p>
CAUTION: Pulsed operation of the laser diode assumes that it is rated to
accept the peak current - don't assume you can modify a CW green laser pointer
for higher efficiency by installing a pulsed driver - it may just blow the
laser diode!  Thus, I really don't suggest attempting any modifications to
an existing pointer.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Pulsing the laser diode generates more average pump power for the same
 average electrical input power because of the characteristics of the laser
 diode - the output is essentially 0 until the lasing threshold is reached
 and increases linearly with current after that.
<p>
 For a typical pump diode with a lasing threshold of 75 mA and a slope
 efficiency of 0.6 W/A, pulsing at 300 mA with a 50 percent duty cycle
 instead of a constant 150 mA will result in 50 percent more average pump
 power (three times the peak power) although the electrical input power will
 be very nearly identical since the voltage drop (around 2 V for a typical
 diode) doesn't vary much with current (150 mA * 2 V being equal to 300 mA
 * 2 V * 0.5).  The actual output power will be about 135 mW peak (67.5 mW
 average) compared to the CW power of 45 mW.
<p>
<li>Pulsing the laser diode will also result in higher efficiency in the
 1,064 nm lasing process because the higher peak pump power means that
 the lasing threshold of the vanadate will be less of a factor.  Like the
 pump diode behavior, 1,064 power is 0 until the lasing threshold is reached
 and then increases more or less linearly with increasing pump power.  
<p>
 For a typical laser pointer cavity, the lasing threshold may be 20 mW so if
 the pump power is pulsed at 135 mW instead of being run CW at 45 mW, the
 peak intracavity power will be 4.6 times greater and the average intracavity
 power will be 2.3 times greater for the same electrical power input!
<p>
<li>Pulsing the laser diode will also result in higher efficiency because
 the peak power inside the cavity will be greater for the non-linear
 1,064 nm to 532 nm conversion process.  As with the increased laser diode
 and vanadate lasing efficiency, using pulsed drive in the example above,
 doubling the intracavity power will more than double the 532 nm power thus
 resulting in a net increase in output even with the 50 percent duty cycle.
 With a factor of 4.6 as in the example above, doubling efficiency will be
 much much greater.
<p>
<li>Using FRQS will further increase the peak power inside the cavity and
 result in much greater efficiency in the 1,064 nm to 532 nm conversion
 process.  FRQS uses a saturable absorber in the form of either an additional
 optical element or possibly just a coating so no additional electronics are
 needed.
</ol>
<p>
It's quite possible for these techniques to improve overall efficiency by
a factor of 5 or more with the disadvantages (depending on which ones are
used) being a more expensive pump diode, a more complex driver, the cost of
the saturable absorber for the FRQS, and the somewhat less desirable pulsed
beam.
<p>
(There may also be a perceptual advantage to quasi-CW operation where at
certain repetition rates - just under the flicker fusion frequency of human
vision - they will appear slightly brighter for a given average power.
However, I'd be surprised if any manufacturer actually deliberately took
advantage of this effect - I would expect the flicker to be annoying at the
very least.)
<p>
It may be possible to tell which type of pointer you have by the duty cycle
of the beam.  Although the frequency of pulsed drive and the FRQS could be
similar (several kHz), a duty cycle that is large (e.g., 25 percent or more)
is likely the result of pulsed drive since a higher cost diode is needed to
handle the peak power and pushing this too far makes it very expensive.
Q-switched output pulses would be very narrow compared to the pulse rate -
probably only a few ns - which for all intents and purposes, would appear
as singularities. :)  And, if both a pulsed pump diode and FRQS are used,
there may be a mixture of spot sizes.  Two green pointers I've tested that
used the same DPSS module but not the same drivers both pulsed with about a
50 percent duty cycle but at widely different frequencies - 300 Hz and 4.5
kHz (neither used FRQS).

<h3><A NAME="ssleslp">The Edmund Scientific Model L54-101 Green Laser
 Pointer</A></h3>

I was given one of these, almost new, for the express purpose of taking it
apart.  The safety/info sticker says it is actually from
<A HREF="//www.bwtek.com/">B&W Tek</A> and is a model BWGP, serial number 305.
(<A HREF="http://www.edsci.com/">Edmund Scientific</A> is just a reseller of
these types of products.  Their current stock number is CR30541-02.)  But,
although B&W Tek has many models of green DPSS lasers, no pointers are
currently listed on their Web site so they apparently don't sell pointers
to end-users, only as an OEM for sale through distributors.
<p>
Partly, this endeavor was intended to help with a research project on microchip
lasers and I suspect partly because it's stability and output were not that
great and the owner wanted an excuse to get a new one.  The original cost was
$495!  Heck, it's only Government money. :)  When I got it, the
output would vary from less than 1 mW to as much as 2.5 to 3 mW apparently
at random.   (It is rated 1 to 3 mW but I would have expected the power to
more consistent.)  At first I thought this was just the natural behavior of an
inadequately thermally controlled DPSS system but then discovered that
physical pressure on the laser diode contacts on the end of the DPSS module
itself affected output power.  (The specs for the DPSS laser modules used in
these things does state a power variation of up to 30%.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslafgl">A First Generation Green Laser Pointer</A> for
links to suppliers.)  So, I suspect it was a combination of both causes and I
would have to get inside the DPSS module itself in any case.
<p>
This pointer looks like a fat silver pen in two sections with gold trim.  It's
powered by a 3 V lithium battery.  They claim a battery life of 2 to 3 hours
when operated continuously.  I'm not sure I believe that.  Manufacturers often
specify a battery life which assumes the duty cycle of usage is less than
50 percent as it would be in an actual pointing application as opposed to its
use as an expensive cat teaser.  What a concept. :)
<p>
<A HREF="grnptr2.jpg">Components of Edmund Scientific L54-101 Green DPSS
Laser Pointer</A> is a photo of the major parts.
The construction details are shown in <A HREF="l54-101.gif">Edmund Scientific
L54-101 Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>.  (Contrast this to the simplicity of a
<A HREF="lsrptr1.gif">Typical Red Laser Pointer</A>!, also shown next to
one-another in <A HREF="lptrcmp1.gif">Comparison of Red and Green Laser Pointer
Complexity</A>.)  The diagram and following description should help make sense
of the discussion below.  The driver board schematic can be found in the
section: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsglp2">Laser Diode Driver from Green Laser
Pointer 2 (GLP-LD2)</A>.
<p>
The pump laser diode is an almost invisible bare chip soldered to a copper
heatsink.  Its output facet is almost touching the surface of the vanadate
crystal.  The actual laser cavity for the 1,064 nm IR laser is between the
left surface of the Nd:YVO4 (vanadate) crystal and the left surface of the
OC (Output Coupler) mirror.  Mirror coatings on the vanadate and OC mirror
are designed to reflect a wavelength of 1,064 nm as perfectly as possible -
which is pretty darn perfect typically being better than 99.9% reflectivity.
The coating on the vanadate is also coated to transmit the 808 nm pump
light with minimal reflection or loss and the one on the OC mirror is
anti-reflection (AR) coated for 532 nm.  If the KTP crystal weren't present,
the output of the pointer would be totally IR at 1,064 nm due to that slight
0.01% or less leakage through the OC mirror coating as well as leakage of the
808 nm pump through both mirrors.  Needless to say, this wouldn't be terribly
useful.  The IR filter prevents this from escaping - don't remove it!  Despite
the very low transmission for 1,064 nm through the OC mirror, due to the very
high intensity inside the laser cavity, the leakage of IR may be similar in
power to the desired green output and there is also the 808 nm pump light
which goes right through both mirrors.)  The KTP crystal is one of a class of
non-linear electro-optic materials that when mounted at just the right
orientation ("phase matched") and placed in a high intensity beam at 1,064 nm,
converts a portion of the IR to visible light at exactly double the frequency
(half the wavelength) - 532 nm green.  Since the OC mirror passes green light,
whatever gets converted to green on the forward pass through the KTP comes
out the front of the pointer after being expanded and collimated.  (A
significant fraction also is converted on the backward pass but this
is generally just discarded as getting it to line up with the main beam
at the same direction, without interference, and in a stable manner is
usually more trouble than it's worth.)
<p>
A bit of somewhat gentle bending and twisting separated the battery holder
rear section from the front section containing the laser diode driver sticking
out its end and the actual DPSS laser module.  The front gold plated bezel
could also be unscrewed revealing the collimating lens on a screw mount glued
in place.  That was the easy part.  Getting into the actual DPSS module
would be much tougher.  I'm beginning to sense something very familiar at
this point though.
<p>
Next, I wrapped a wire around the two terminals for the laser diode (to
prevent damage from ESD, etc.) and unsoldered the driver board.
<p>
After some careful scraping of Epoxy from the edge and threads of an aluminum
retaining ring and scraping additional Epoxy to free it from the plate it
holds in place (so that wouldn't turn), I was able to get apart without
destroying anything physically using my custom made pointer retaining ring
removal tool - bent piece of sheet steel with two prongs to fit the slots
in the ring. :)
<p>
And guess what?  As I suspected from outward appearance of the collimating
lens and rear of the module, the guts are <i>identical</i> to those shown
in the "Dissection of Green Laser Pointer" found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.74 or
higher).  Not just similar, but <i>identical</i>.  
See <A HREF="grnorg1.jpg">Internal Organs of Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A> for
an annotated photo of the major components.  What's interesting is that
this sample is a current model pointer while the dissected one was quite old
(as these things go).  Thus, I assume but don't know for sure that since the
DPSS module is the same as those in green pointers from other sources, B&W
Tek must buy the DPSS modules from the Far East and install them in a case
with their own driver board and safety label.  However, they won't even give
you the time of day if asked about these pointers but just direct you to the
original seller for info or repairs.
<p>
I was hoping at this point to repair whatever was causing the erratic power
and reassemble the pointer but that wasn't to be.  At some point, the diode
seems to have gotten damaged so the pointer's output is almost non-existent
with the original diode and driver; with a fiber-coupled 808 nm pump, it
still works.  How exactly the pump diode died I don't know for sure.  I
thought at first that the external power supply I was using might have had
too much ripple and the driver couldn't cope with that.  However, I later
tested the driver on the same power wupply with a laser diode simulator as
a load (a pair of silicon diodes in series with a 0.1 ohm resistor).  While
monitoring the output current on an oscilloscope, I couldn't detect anything
amiss despite trying low and high input, switching the supply on and off at
random, etc.  So, I now tend to doubt it was an electrical problem.  Another
possibility is that contamination got on the diode facet when I opened it up.
Whatever the cause, the pointer was happily outputting 3 mW when over the
course of 10 seconds or so, the output dropped to under 1 mW and has been
going down hill from there.
<p>
Then, the vanadate fell off - bad glue job so I am now reattaching that.
<p>
The OC was mounted way off-center indicating that either the diode was off
center and/or the vanadate was slightly tilted - I'ms leaning toward the latter
and expect that to be reduced at least with my new glue job.  As the
vanadate/KTP assembly is rotated, there are positions where there is a lot
of green (with my fiber-coupled pump) but it doesn't come out the front
indicating that the alignment is way off.
<p>
With hints from the dissection photos (thanks Dave), I have not had to use a
hacksaw for anything!  The front optics screw off and the entire DPSS module
was a not so hard to remove press fit in the outer casing.
<p>
The only reason I can see that they still make these things with discrete
optics is that there is more control over beam quality with the separate
spherical OC than with a hybrid CASIX type crystal.  However, since at least
one company, Melles Griot, now sells high quality DPSS lasers using composite
crystals of their own design, there are ways around this (probably by careful
shaping of the pump beam).
<p>
But the overall mechanical quality looks quite good for some things (e.g.,
all the retaining rings and screwed together parts fit perfectly) and poor
for others with some hand-filed parts (like a spacer ring) and sloppy
tolerances for the vanadate and KTP plates inside the barrel.
<p>
For the step-by-step procedure to take this to bits without a hacksaw
and put it back together, see
the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strdgp1">Disassembly and
Reassembly/Alignment of the Edmunds L54-101 Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>.

<h3><A NAME="sslalp1">Anatomy of an Inexpensive Green Laser Pointer 1</A></h3>

This is a newer pointer than the Edmunds Scientific L54-101, above, and
is also a much simpler design with a composite
Multiple Crystal Assembly (MCA) rather than discrete crystals and optics.
Pointers using this approach are now (Winter 2004) going for less then $100,
even cheaper on eBay.
<p>
The external appearance of this pointer is similar to the one shown
in <A HREF="grnptr1.jpg">Components of Typical Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>
though the interior construction and driver differ slightly.  However, it's
likely that they both use the same optical design.  I'm not sure of the
exact manufacturer or model for either one but I have been informed by the
original owner that the pointer described below may be a "MOD-2", from
<A HREF="http://www.z-bolt.com/">Z-Bolt - Beam Of Light Technologies</A>.
(There are actually some rather nice photos of the insides of green laser
pointers on their Web site, but not this exact model.)  For this "MOD-2",
it's virtually 100% certain that all they did was turn the current pot
on the driver PCB. :)
<p>
A detailed diagram of the internal construction of a typical MCA-based
pointer is shown in <A HREF="glpmca1.gif">Typical Green DPSS Laser Pointer
Using MCA</A>.
<p>
Here is a rundown of the components:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pump diode:</b> A 5.6 mm can package with no clothes similar to the
 one shown in <A HREF="ldwnc1.jpg">Laser Diode With No Cover</A>.  A retaining
 ring secures it inside the left-most cylinder in the photo.
<p>
<li><b>Pump optics:</b> A very short focal length molded lens relays the beam
 from the diode.  I assume it's made of plastic but have not confirmed this.
<p>
<li><b>Laser crystals:</b> Composite Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>/KTP MCA, around
 1.5 x 1.5 mm cross section, 2.5 mm in length.  This looks exactly like a
 CASIX MCA but not the standard DPM0101 or DPM0102 - something in between.
<p>
<li><b>Output optics:</b> Short focal length negative expanding lens close
 to the KTP with a positive collimating lens close to the output aperture.
<p>
<li><b>IR-blocking filter:</b> Just behind the output aperture.
</ul>
<p>
Info and schematics of the laser diode driver boards for both the pointers
can be found in the sections: <A HREF="laserdps.htm#dpsglp1">Laser Diode
Driver from Green Laser Pointer 1 (GLP-LD1)</A> and

(GLP-LD3)</A>.
<p>

and put it back together, see
the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strdgp2">Disassembly and
Reassembly/Alignment of an MCA-Based Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>.
<p>
The particular sample on which the above description is based
should never have made it out of the manufacturer's quality control department.
The MCA was glued in place at a significant angle resulting in a misshapened
beam which could not be corrected by output optics alignment.  That, and
a somewhat erratic beam (which he thought was due to a bad switch) prompted the
original owner to attempt to disassemble it to clean the switch at least.
Upon reassembly, the driver PCB caught on the pushbutton or something yanking
on the the feed-through leads of the pump diode which ripped the bonding wires
from the top of the laser diode chip.  I rebuilt the diode and partially
restored functionality but it's not something I'd like to repeat or justify
based on the time spent. :)  Read
all about it in the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strrgp">Partially Reviving
an Inexpensive Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>.

<h3><A NAME="sslalp2">Anatomy of an Inexpensive Green Laser Pointer 2</A></h3>

I was given the remains of a green laser pointer, probably a basic
model from Leadlight.  Thanks to Iain Rauch (www.laserpointersuk.com)
for this contribution of a <A HREF=
"http://www.skylineselect.co.uk/product_info.php/cPath/21/products_id/31">
Leadlight GLP1 Green Laser Pointer</A> for analysis.  The
optical design of this pointer is very similar to
that of the one above.  However, it uses what appears to be a nice Sony
5.6 mm pump diode complete with cover and window.  The marking on it would
indicate that it is likely rated at 500 mW.  The composite crystal is about
0.5x0.5x2.5mm, possibly yet another version from CASIX which might be called
a DPM0100.5.  Except for the pump diode and its relay lens
which are secured with a threaded ring, and the output collimating lens which
screws in for the focus adjustment and is then locked with a dab of adhesive,
everything is glued in place making for an even simpler lower cost assembly.
<p>
On the bits of the unit I received, the pump diode was totally destroyed
to the extent that not only didn't it lase, but it was electrically open.
So, maybe the car battery trick was used in an attempt to boost power
output. :) Alignment is very precise so it might be possible to replace
the diode without reworking the output optics at all.  If I can find a
suitable diode, I will attempt a transplant.
<p>
I have not determined the schematic of the driver but assume it to be
similar to one of those found in the nearly identical green pointers
described above.

<h3><A NAME="sslalp3">Anatomy of an Inexpensive Green Laser Pointer 3</A></h3>

This appears to be similar to the one above but uses an APC (Active Power
Control) driver rather than an ACC (Active Current Control) constant current
driver.  See <A HREF="gptrapc1.jpg">Photos of Green Laser Pointer Using APC
Driver</A>.  (Photo courtesy of: Jerry Oltion.)
APC maintains a constant output power until the batteries die
and thus eliminates the annoying power variations in brightness resulting
from thermal effects on the pump diode and laser crystals as the pointer
heats up.  It also enables the output power to be set very close to the
legal limit of 5 mW knowing that it won't be exceeded.  While this particular
pointer has all the parts in its driver exposed, some manufacturers are known
to seal them in hard Epoxy after adjustment to make them (more) difficult to
boost to illegal power levels.
<p>
Red pointers with APC - which is most of them - use a laser diode
with a built-in photodiode for the feedback.  However, green pointers
can't do this so there is an angled beamsplitter plate and external
photodiode for this purpose as can be seen in the photos.  I do not
have an actual sample of one of these pointers as yet to reverse
engineer but expect the circuit to be very similar to other APC drivers
used in red laser pointers.

<h3><A NAME="ssldps3">Anatomy of a 3 mW Green DPSSFD Laser</A></h3>

Green laser pointers and green diode laser modules have many features in
common.  Since direct injection green laser diodes are not yet commercially
available, they are both based on DPSSFD laser technology and are therefore
much more complex inside than their red counterparts.  In addition, in part
because of this complexity, corners can't be cut as much with green pointers
as is the case of red pointers compared to generally higher quality red diode
laser modules.  Thus, the high cost of these things appears to be justified.
<p>
For more details and all the gory details of a step-by-step disassembly
procedure performed on a green DPSSFD laser pointer, see the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslafgl">A First Generation Green Laser Pointer</A>,
above.  Having the photos referenced there in front of you (preferably in
a separate browser window) may also help to clarify some of the fine points
in the following explanation.
<p>
I don't know whether the unit described below was a green laser pointer or a
green diode laser module. However, for the same output power, the structures
should be very similar.
<p>
Note: The manufacturer of this particular device shall remain anonymous for
obvious reasons as you shall see below. :-)  Suffice it to say that it was
from a well known company and cost about $450 new - ouch!
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I was sent a diode pumped doubled laser of 3 mW power level for dissection as
it was virtually dead.  See the section: "Failure analysis of 3 mW DPSSFD
green laser" for a discussion of what went wrong.  What follows is a summary
of the construction details of this device:
<p>
<ul>
<li>An external driver module powered a ~500 mW 808 nm diode mounted on a BeO
  block (gold plated so the microscopic laser diode chip could be bonded
  directly to it).
<p>
  Looking at a diode catalog this is called a "C" block and is really just a
  bare laser diode on a high conduction heat sink.
<p>
<li>Specs on Mr. Diode:
<p>
  Brimrose BWK-808-.5 
<p>
  Material: ALGaAs<br>
  Wavelength: 808 nm +/- 4 nm<br>
  Nominal power output: 300 mW<br>
  Spectral Width: less than 3 nm FHWM<br>
  Threshold current: 0.15 to 0.25 A<br>
  Operating current: 0.70 to 0.95 A<br>
  Active emitting area: 1 um x 100 um<br>
  Beam divergence: 35 x 10 degrees FHWM<br>
  Temperature coefficient: .27 nm/&deg;C<br>
  Recommended operating temperature: -20 to 30 &deg;C<br>
<p>
  According to the manufacturer's specs, it's a 0.7 W diode derated to .5 W.
<p>
<li>The laser diode fired directly at a 2 mm square piece of 1 mm thick
  Neodymium:Yttrium Vandate (Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>) mounted on a 1 mm thick disk
  of copper about the size of a nickel which was glued into a plastic vee
  block.  This disk was designed to provide good cooling for the crystals and
  dissipate waste heat from the pump diode.
<p>
<li>On the other side of the copper disk was a 3 x 3 x 5 mm block of KTP
  which is the frequency doubling crystal.
<p>
<li>The KTP crystal had a concave mirror of glass coated to reflect 1064 nm
  light pressed up against it. This reflected back toward the
  Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> through the KTP doubling crystal, so as to form
  the resonant cavity.
<p>
  Therefore, the KTP crystal is actually part of the laser resonator for this
  design.
<p>
<li>A BK7 lens coated to transmit 532 nm and reflect 1064 nm was held up
  against the doubling crystal with a oplastic disk on three screws 120
  degrees apart so that the alignment could be adjusted.
<p>
  The back face of the Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> crystal had the other cavity mirror
  coating on it, one that transmits the 808 nm pump light into the crystal,
  but reflects the 1064 nm laser light toward the doubler.  
<p>
  BK7 is a kind of high purity borosilicate optical glass, it has a coating on
  one side to form a reflector for the 1064 nm wavelength that the
  Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> lases on, the other end of the laser is formed by a
  coating on the pump side
  of the Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, a coating that reflects 1064 nm but transmits
  the 808 nm from the pump diode. 
<p>
<li>The Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> generates polarized laser light because of its
  crystal lattice structure, this polarization must match the phase matching
  range of the crystal, so the Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> was rotated to peak the unit
  then glued down.
<p>
<li>The output goes to a 1:10 beam expander/collimator.
<p>
<li>Finally, there was an IR adsorbing filter for safety made of blue plastic.
  This prevents stray IR pump light from escaping.
<p>
<li>Much attention was given to heat sinking for the diode, and the two
 crystals.
</ul>
<p>
I am thoroughly convinced this would have to be the easiest green laser to
build, orders of magnitude less then argon, however it will lack some in
power.  However much care is needed with thermal management and diode
current, but just about anybody could make one of these out of stock copper
and aluminum with not much more then a drill press and a file and chopsaw
and dremel tool. It was probably the most alignment insensitive laser i
have ever seen.

</PRE>
So you have the pump diode at one side, effectively shining in the end of the
laser cavity, this is referred to as "End Pumping" as opposed to "Side
Pumping".  The laser light bounces back and forth inside the
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> and KTP between the coatings on the outside end of the
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> and the BK7 mirror.
<p>
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> is what lases.  Neodymium is the lasing material, the
YVO<sub>4</sub> is the crystalline host material.   Potassium Titanyl
Phosphate is the nonlinear medium for doubling.  In this case it is placed
inside the cavity as tremendously high field strengths are needed for doubling
to work. Your Lexel-88 argon ion laser may do two W of output, but floating
inside the cavity is as much as 3 to 4 KILOwatts of laser light one of the
reasons a lasers optics must be very clean, a larger HeNe laser has as much
as 40 W of laser light in the cavity, a typical small barcode tube has about
10 W inside.  
<p>
The laser is based on an approach called intracavity doubling.  Other DPSSFD
lasers may just shoot the coherent beam from a high power YAG crystal at
the KTP crystal outside the cavity.  The
<A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/">National Ignition Facility</A>
laser currently under construction (Winter 1999) at
<A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</A>
uses the latter approach (for 1.8 MJ, 500 Terawatt pulses!)  Of
course, its final stage frequency multiplier crystals are just bit larger.
They use KDP (Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate) for doubling or KD*P (Potassium
Dideuterium Phosphate) for tripling.  Each slab is about 2 FEET across cut
from ingots weighing over 500 pounds!  And, there are 192 of them since there
are 192 beams in all. :-)  Not to mention the over 7,000 other large optical
components in the NIF!  If your are curious, see:
<A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/project/pdf/NIF_Optics.pdf">NIF
Optics</A> for details.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Without any optics to shape and focus the output of the pump diode onto the
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> crystal, I bet a lot of the pump power is wasted.  Better
DPSS lasers typically have a collimating lens, prisms, and focusing lens
between the laser diode and crystal.  For example, see the "80 mW Green
DPSSFD Laser" under "Miscellaneous DPSS Lasers" in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.74
or higher).

<h3><A NAME="sslmcgd">Measurements on a Cheap Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A></h3>

Here is some info from someone who wishes to remain anonymous:
<p>
These are my observations about a common green laser pointer from China that
can be found in huge quantities on eBay these days for under $10.
I used a Coherent LaserCheck pocket laser power meter where the
target wavelength can dialed in, an Ocean Optics fiber optic spectrometer
calibrated for relative spectral sensitivity, and a constant current DC
source to power the laser.
<p>
Using the spectrometer, the following was observed:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The laser starts lasing at about 70 mA of drive current emitting at
 808 nm with no visible green radiation.  The IR power at 808 nm increases
 with current.
<p>
<li>At about 140 mA, green 532 nm begins to appear, but it's very small
 compared to a lot of 808 nm IR radiation.
<p>
<li>At around 160 or 170 mA, the amount of 532 nm and 808 nm become
 equal with the level of 808 nm staying about the same as it was at
 140 mA.
<p>
<li>Up to 215 mA (my current source was limited to 215 nm), the amount
 of 532 nm increases and 808 nm decreases to about 10 to 20% of 532 nm
 peak height at 215 nm.
<p>
<li>This particular laser did not have a built in IR filter.  Using an
 IR filter taken from a Webcam to kill 808 nm (and 1064 nm), the power
 of 532 nm was measured to be about 5 mW at 1 m away at 215 mA with
 the power meter.
<p>
<li>There was some 1064 nm radiation and the spectrometer was also showing
 a peak from 532 nm at 1064 nm due to the diffraction grating used as a
 dispersing element in the spectrometer.  Using a high
 pass filter with cut-off at 750 nm, the 532 nm contribution was killed.  After
 that, the estimated power of 1064 nm radiation was about 20 to 30% of 532 nm
 power at 215 mA current which was 5 mW.
</ul>
<p>
It must be noted that when measuring power with power meter proper wavelength
needs to be dialed in and filters should be used as needed.  For example,
at 215 mA the power meter set to 532 nm showed 25 mW power without a filter
and 5 mW with the IR filter, hinting that "20mW" was coming from 808 nm and
1064 nm.  However, power of IR cannot be measured with the meter set up for
532 nm.  At 150 mA there was almost no 532 nm radiation (less than 1% of
808 nm peak, but still well visible by eye) and no appreciable amount of
1064 nm either.  Under these conditions the meter set up for 532 nm read
16 mW of 808 nm IR power.  However, when the meter was properly set up
for 808 nm, the power level of 808 nm turned out to be only about 1 mW.
Since the 808 nm (and 1064 nm) IR power never exceeded 2 to 3 mW, this
laser does not need an IR filter that much.  So the info in elsewhere
about 10s of mW of invisible 808 nm IR from the pump laser for DPSS
green laser should be taken with a grain of salt, at least for green
laser pointers specified to be 5 mW.

<h3><A NAME="ssldps4">Failure Analysis of a 3 mW Green DPSSFD Laser Module</A></h3>

See the section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps3">Anatomy of a 3 mW DPSSFD green
laser</A> for a summary of the construction of this compact 3 mW laser.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Well it's like this, the driver was fine, the pump diode was consuming the
right amount of current, and judging from the lasing mode, something internal
was way misaligned since a 100 uW YAG pointer is a wonderful toy but not of
much use, I decided that a educational exploration was in order to further the
cause of potentially inexpensive but bright green lasing in NE Ohio and
Arizona. My conclusions:
<p>
DPSSFD lasers are one hell of a lot easier to build then argons, by a couple
of orders of magnitude!!!
<p>
The autopsy required destruction of the shell, the heatsink fins unscrewed
revealing a set of four small screws to remove the core of the module. This
was a problem because they were bonded down with spotwelds and everything was
coated in a thick glop of TorrSeal. Torrseal for those of you who don't know,
is a ultra high vacuum compatible cement used for fixing leaks in vacuum and
laser systems, you put torrseal on it, its bonded forever, I don't know of any
solvents that will touch it.  It does not outgas and is for all practical
purposes a non conductive metal when hard.  Its hard as diamond . SO I drilled
out the screws.
<p>
Several ingenious traps were built in to prevent disassembly, such as left
hand threads, threading the diode module barrel with 80 tpi microthreads and
then screwing it past the mating female threads so it could not be blindly
rethreaded and removed etc.
<p>
So what killed the laser?
<p>
The Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> crystal had a thermal microcrack right where the diode pumped it!
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> is sensitive to heat.  As far as I can tell, something caused the
Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> surface to craze, having half a watt focused at it should have been
fine, I think we can write it off to poor quality crystals and design.
<p>
According to someone who manufactures these things, for every winner he
produces, he gets three to five low grade units, and that's what drives the
costs up.  Supposedly this has improved over the past few years.
<p>
The failure was most likely due to the design.  If they would have used
silicone instead of TorrSeal (rigid Epoxy) to hold the crystal to the copper
disk it probably wouldn't have propagated the cracks with the heat-up and
cool-down cycles.

<h3><A NAME="sslscdp">Steve's Comments on the Quality of Green Laser Pointers
 and Small DPSSFD Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
A lot depends on quality control and who's doing the buying. I bought a few
"duds" or off spec greens (less than 5 mW) to keep costs down and to use for
experimentation.  This resulted in some eye opening lessons.  The thermal
management is very critical with Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, for example, cooling a
cheap pulsed pointer at the diode-end with a can of component cooler easily
results in a doubling of the output power. In general, you want to heat the
KTP, cool the Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> and temperature tune the diode so that its
wavelength, which varies greatly with temperature, matches the peak adsorption
of the lasing medium. I had one reject that did 100 uW or so of green at room
temperature, take it down 15 &deg;C and it did 3 mW.  The alignment did not
need to be changed, it was already picked well for both temperatures.   The
caveat is that just because power comes up, it does not mean  mode quality
goes up. As you chill a cheap DPSS laser, all sorts of stray beams show up
and the divergence broadens.
<p>
With a commercial module, there is more flexibility in constructing the
alignment structure in the laser. Most pointers have the optics glued down
on sleds and the optics are tweaked as the glue dries, as opposed to the
70 TPI screws used for KTP and OC adjustment on better grade units. A low
cost YAG must be tweaked under its operating conditions and probably has its
best beam quality over a 5 &deg;C range around room temperature.  Cost
control is the issue here, so the pointers maker sacrifices.
<p>
I am surprised they are still making pulsed units.  When they make the pulsed
pointers, they are doing it to keep the diode temperature down while pushing
it harder to compensate for lower quality parts and poor alignment.  KTP
quality control in crystals priced less then $200 is nothing to write home
about, and $35 KTP crystals are even worse. The brass and aluminum
used in constructing these things in the pen form is by no means thermally
stable.  My friend who makes systems got 3 low power KTP for every 1 he got
that met specs.  Manufacturers have improved on this recently, but if your
going to do green, buy the matched and graded pairs of KTP-Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>
that have already been tested together. 
<p>
If you are thinking of buying one, limit your search to larger domestic
manufacturers like Meshtel Intelite or B&W Tech, so you can  have a warranty
that is enforceable.  And, get one that is on spec, not on sale. Save up the
$$$ and buy a diode laser module that is more then 5 mW (laser pointers are
limited by CDRH rules to 5 mW max).  Quality control improves as power and
cost goes up.  The lasers are often built from the same design, then graded
for power.  So a 5 mW unit is one the alignment tech could not tweak up to
10 mW.  They tend to gracefully degrade from undercooling and handling, so
carefully adhere to the manufacturers spec on the input power.
<p>
A better unit will state a larger power supply input range. Beware of
those that want to see exactly 3.3 V and no more.  Not only is 3.3 V hard to
generate but such a spec is often a warning about the drive electronics - or
lack thereof. Also watch out for units that have a positive case polarity,
so you can't have the case ever touch ground.  This may make using the unit in
a lab or in a projector more difficult.

<h3><A NAME="sslicps">Increasing Output Power of Small DPSSFD Laser</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Start by chilling the laser, but DO NOT increase the current, As you chill the
diode, you shift the point at which it will run away and blow up to a lower
level. If you don't get decent gains in power with chill alone, something is
way wrong with the operating point of the laser. You might find you only
have to chill it 10 to 25 &deg;C below room temp, much more then that may
shift the pump diode wavelength away from the adsorption wavelength of the
YAG crystal and power will also drop. This assumes the structure of the laser
will keep it aligned as its chilled - some cheap ones wont.  A quick test
can be done with a can of component cooler, if the case is sealed so that
the spray wont hit the optics. 
<p>
You should see dramatic gains with just cooling the existing laser in its
case without ripping it open and modifying it for the TE. If this is the case,
just get a decent sized TE and a big heatsink for the TE and strap it on to
the existing heatsink. 
<p>
Ideally you'd chill the diode, slightly chill the Nd:YAG crystal to compensate
for the additional pump power, and heat the KTP doubler, but attempting to do
this is not worth it on a 10 mW system to begin with.
<p>
(From: Anonymous (localnet1@yahoo.com).)
<p>
Basically cooling a DPSS laser will help prevent damage by heat. BUT it can
actually reduce your output power. Many DPSS manufacturers, especially the
ones who make inexpensive modules, use diodes that are a bit short in
wavelength and are expected to heat up a bit, since they only have ambient
cooling.  Then, the output wavelength of the diode matches the absorption peak
of the lasing medium (e.g., YAG).  So, if you cool the module, even to room
temperature, the output may be reduced.  For maximum output, you should most
likely increase the current, in conjunction with active cooling, but the cooling
should be regulated so that the assembly does not get too cold.
<p>
If you maintain cooling efficiency (and that is sometimes hard to do in a small
package) diode life of large diodes (i.e., bars, which have very efficient
cooling packages) asymtotically approaches zero with higher currents.  At rated
current, lifetime may be 5,000 hours; at 200% rated current, lifetime (of my
vendor's diodes) is around 500 hours; and at 300% rated current, lifetime is
normally less than several tens of hours - or it may fail immediately or after
a day).  As you can see, even at 200% rated current the diode will still have a
fairly decent life, although no where near what a diode run at rated current
will last.
<p>
What it comes down to in the end is how you define the term 'significantly'?
If you are an experimenter or hobbyist, and only turn your laser on from
time-to-time for a few hours, a decrease in lifetime of a few thousand hours
should be acceptable.  However, if you are building a device for regular use,
that may not be.  Unfortunately, there is no way to tell what increasing the
current will do for <b>certain</b>.  But if the increase isn't extreme, it
shouldn't cause catastrophic failure of your assembly. However, your other
optics may not be able to handle the increase in power.  The only way to find
out if they will is to try.
<p>
Also don't forget, lasers are complex creatures.  Increasing the current a
little can cause your output to decrease due to thermal problems, or a small
increase in current could double it.  DPSS systems are nonlinear, so output
power often jumps with small increases in current, up to the point where
efficiency starts to 'fold-over' due mainly to thermal problems

<h3><A NAME="ssldps5">What is the Difference Between Green and Blue DPSSFD
 Lasers?</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
Well, a little, and a lot, depending on how you look at it.  Green lasers are
doubling the 1064 nm transition of Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, or some other
similar host medium.  The 946 nm line is what is being doubled in blue lasers,
and 473 nm light is the result.  Often, the choice for a Non-Linear Optical
(NLO) crystal is different for the two lines.  KTP is the crystal of choice
normally for green, and LBO for blue.  Also, the 946 nm line has a much
smaller cross section for emission.  This means lower efficiency and the 1064
line and even the weak 1319 nm line will try to compete with it, stealing
energy. On top of that, the 946 line is self absorbing making the device a lot
trickier to generate (like ruby, this is a case where the laser medium is
actually somewhat opaque to the frequency of light the laser is trying to
operate at, where as YAG is almost perfectly transparent at 1064 nm).
<p>
So, they start out with pretty much the same structure: High power laser
diodes at 808 nm pump a Nd host which lases at 948 nm, and this is inter-cavity
doubled.  But upon closer examination there are a lot of differences between
the mechanisms operating in each laser.
<p>
For some of the reasons mentioned above, the brightest commercial source for
473 nm light that I know of is limited to 400 mW, where as you can get a 10 W
CW, or higher 532 nm DPSSFD laser with a pulsed beam.  (Actually at least 10
times this now. --- Sam.)
<p>
Note that to get any sort of efficiency (as these things go) at the 946 nm
line requires cooling the YAG rod (but for certain other lines like 1319 nm,
ambient temperature is fine).  In fact, if you cool YAG enough there are many
other lines that will lase, some that can be doubled to nice shades of yellow
and orange. :)
<p>
(From: Jo.)
<p>
The doubling crystal is KNBO<sub>3</sub> (KN). Temperature stabilization is
a big problem for blue DPSS laser. We use modules where YAG and KN are bonded
together.  The modules are coated ready to use. With TE-control on both the
crystal module and laser diode, a very stable beam is possible at about
5 to 15 mW.  I think there will be better materials and components next year.
Many companies (we too) are working at developing blue lasers.
<p>
You can try a KTP-crystal. For extra cavity doubling, output power will
maybe not be very high. Better to use the KN crystal. This will cost about
$220 at Goldbridge, which is a manufacturer in China or Taiwan.  I'ms also
developing a range of blue and green lasers. Currently, I get 160 mW CW green
when pumping a Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>+KTP using 1.5 W of pump power at 808 nm. At
the moment I'ms working at temperature control for better stability.

<h3><A NAME="ssldscq">Bob's Comments on Quality and Cost of DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
Here is a bit of my philosophy on DPSS lasers.  There are basically three
levels of performance and cost:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Great engineering and top quality components.  These lasers approach the
 theoretical limits for efficiency and output power.
<p>
<li>Good engineering and good components.  These lasers are a realistic
 tradeoff in cost versus power.
<p>
<li>Sloppy engineering and questionable components.  These lasers are very
 cheap, but have a short lifetime, and put out less power as a comparable
 unit of types (1) or (2).
</ol>
<p>
An example of the category (1) laser would be the DPSS units made by Coherent
and Spectra-Physics.  For example, Coherent's Compass(tm) series DPSS lasers
put out (up to) a well regulated 200 mW of power.  This is achieved with a
2W pump diode run at a hair under 50% of its maximum rated power.  The
current 'lab' efficiency record is about 280 mw out of a 1 W pump.  In order
to get these efficiencies, complex optics and engineering are needed.  These
lasers are VERY expensive.  The 200 mW unit sells for around $20K last time I
checked.
<p>
There are plenty of lasers that fall into category (2) on the market.  I feel
The primary reason these lasers do not achieve the maximum possible
performance is that they often have a small linear cavity, as this is a much
easier to design unit, than the complex geometries in a more pricey unit.
Micro chip laser use a very rugged design, but by it's inherent nature, is
even less efficient than short linear cavities normally are (i.e., cavity
lengths on the order of 5 cm and under).  This simple design creates a HUGH
cost saving in assembly though.
<p>
Here is an idea of how the Coherent laser is assembled.  Keep in mind it is a
ring laser, with two mirrors, a KTP crystal, and a piece of vanadate that
diffracts the beam by about 30 degrees.  The components are all held in long
tweezer-like tools during alignment.  The baseplate of the optics etc. is held
below it.  Then, the laser is pulsed (as there is no thermal contact between
the optics and their heat sinks).  The components are aligned by using 5 axis
positioning equipment, holding each tweezer - literally in mid air.  When the
optimal alignment is optimal, an optical cement is used to form their mounts.
This is not an automated process.  From set up to gluing take about 2 days.
Not volume work here!
<p>
Also, another reason why the category (3) lasers do not reach the expected
output power is that they are only being pumped with inadequate power. DPSS
output is NOT a linear function.  If the laser has good thermal management, a
laser putting out 100 mW at 1.4 W input power may put out 200 to 250 mW with
2 W of pump power.  But, in order for the laser to be turned up in current in
such a fashion, requires that it has been designed to operate at such power
levels.  Thermal lensing plays an important role in DPSS design at pump
powers in this regime.  If the laser wasn't designed to operate stably at
the higher pump power, no amount of extra diode light will increase it's
efficiency.
<p>
Finally, for category (3) lasers, the single largest reason I am so skeptical
is the rated life time being much lower than industry standards.  This leads me
to believe the diode is being run 'hot' which leads to high levels of
uncertainty of its life time, and also suggests that its assembly is not
the best.  If a manufacturer is going to use poor quality diodes, or run
the diodes past their recommended power, there is no reason for them to
use good quality optics.

<h3><A NAME="sslkcdl">Kevin's Comments on Inexpensive DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

There are many DPSS lasers now available at reasonably attractive prices.
Most are green, but blue, red, and even yellow ones may also be found.
These are mostly of Far East origin with varying degrees of quality, some
quite decent, some quite poor.  But don't expect anything comparable to
a Coherent Compass.  A certain number of components and labor is involved
in constructing even the most rudimentary DPSS laser so as prices decline,
corners may be cut somewhere.  The units described below are typical of
100 mW-class lasers:.
<p>
(From: Kevin Criqui (usenet@kce.com).)
<p>
<b>Good points:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>They work.
<li>They produce rated power or better (at least for now).
<li>They were cheap.
<li>If allowed to stabilize for 15 minutes, beam quality and divergence 
 are reasonably good.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Bad points:</b>
<p>
<li>They took forever to arrive - apparently ordered from China by the
 importer only after they had my money.
<p>
<li>The mechanical quality is poor (one unit was falling apart, but I was able 
 to fix it by removing the "QC" sticker and tightening a screw).
<p>
<li>The output is slow to return to full power after being blanked.  When 
 blanked with a 50% duty cycle signal, you would expect about half the 
 output power, but I measured more like 30%.
<p>
<li>There are no CDRH stickers.
</ul>
<p>
<b>General behavior:</b>
<p>
<li>The output power and mode fluctuates wildly for 1 to 2 minutes before
 settling down.  After warming up for 15 minutes, stability is pretty good.
<p>
<li>The output power seems to settle randomly between 120 mW and 160 mW each 
 time the unit is powered on or blanked for more than a second or two.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="ssldpse">DPSS Laser Efficiency</A></h3>

Compared to lamp pumped solid state lasers, DPSS lasers are the fabulously
efficient and better than many common light bulbs. :)  Here are couple of
typical examples, though no general rules:
<p>
On CASIX's web site they list some examples of conversion statistics
when using an 808 nm laser diode to pump a Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate)
crystal:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Output of 278 mW at 1064 nm with pump power of 730 mW, a conversion
 efficiency of 38% from 808 nm to 1064 nm.
<p>
<li>Output of 2.5 mW at 532 nm with a pump power of 50 mW using intra-cavity
 KTP doubling, a conversion efficiency of 5% from 808 nm to 532 nm.
</ol>
<p>
(From: Matthijs Amelink (matthijs27@hotmail.com).)
<p>
In the book "Solid State Laser Engineering" (5th edition) by Walter Koechner 
there's an example on page 365 for a diode pumped Nd:YAG laser:

<ul>
<li>Laser diode power supply: 60 W.
<li>Laser diode efficiency: 0.33.
<li>Laser diode output: 20 W.
<li>Radiation transfer and absorption efficiency: 0.8 (now down to 16 W).
<li>Laser medium efficiency: 0.68 (Stokes shift and quantum efficiency, now
 down to 11 W).
<li>Resonator efficiency: 0.67.
<li>Output power: 7 W.
</ul>
<p>
There's an entire chapter on doubling efficiency which can't be denoted in
one figure.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
The record efficiency for a green DPSS laser stands at about 12% electrical
power in to green output.  Under optimal conditions, you will get a bit over
1/2 a watt of green for 2 W of 808 nm pump power, but if you are making a
home-built system and not paying megabucks for the hardware, getting a
few hundred mW would be doing a very good job.

<h3><A NAME="sslppdl">Pump Polarization Considerations for DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

Lasing crystals like Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate) have a preferred
orientation for pump absorption and output a polarized beam.  Regardless of
pump polarization, the output polarization is unchanged so that only impacts
the cavity design and orientation of subsequent components like KTP.  This
section addresses some of the issues with respect to pump polarization.
<p>
Using vanadate as an example, the ratio of the absorption coefficients in
the two axes is about 4:1.  For convenience, let's arbitrarily choose the
high absorption direction to be vertical (V) corresponding to the Z axis of an
a-cut crystal) and the low absorption direction to be horizontal (H).  This
would be the case for maximum absorption when pumped directly with a laser
diode mounted with its fast axis vertical.  The absorption length or distance
into the crystal where a given percentage of incident light is absorbed will
vary by the same 4:1 ratio.  This has implications for total absorption, beam
shaping and transverse mode matching, single versus multiple longitudinal
mode operation, and distribution of thermal load:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total absorption:</b> If the doping percentage has been selected so that
 absorption takes place throughout the crystal when pumped with the V
 polarization, absorption will be much lower when pumped with the H
 polarization.  For example, assuming the 4:1 ratio, if the crystal absorbs
 15/16ths of the incident V polarized light, it will only absorb about one
 half of the H polarized light.  Thus, in this example, pump efficiency is
 nearly cut in half (not taking into consideration any other effects) if the
 wrong orientation is used.  However, with a highly doped crystal where nearly
 all the absorption of V polarized light takes place in the first 100 or 200
 um, total absorption may be virtually unchanged even for a crystal which is
 only 500 um (0.5 mm) thick.  Therefore, it isn't always the case that
 matching a polarized pump beam to the Z axis of an a-cut crystal will
 be substantially better.  Depending on doping and other factors, it may
 not make any significant difference.
<p>
<li><b>Beam shaping and transverse mode matching:</b> As the absorption length
 increases, the pump beam profile deeper in the vanadate becomes more of a
 factor.  With a very short absorption length, only the pump beam waist
 diameter really matters (assuming it's placed at or just inside the
 pump-side face of the vanadate).  However, where the absorption takes place
 throughout the crystal, a rapidly expanding pump beam would result in lower
 pump efficiency due to a reduced match between the pump spot and transverse
 mode diameter for a portion of the pump power.
<p>
<li><b>Single versus multiple longitudinal mode operation:</b> A short
 absorption length increases the threshold for the onset of multiple
 longitudinal modes (lasers usually start out single mode just above lasing
 threshold).  For many applications this won't matter but for those
 where it does, this effect could be significant.
<p>
<li><b>Distribution of heat dissipation:</b> The thermal loading inside the
 crystal approximately follows the absorption length.  At pump powers of
 more than a watt or so, this could become a significant consideration.  A
 system designed for non-polarized fiber pumping could end up with a damaged
 crystal if pumped directly with a laser diode.  With an existing crystal,
 there may be an advantage to pumping at some orientation other than optimal
 to equalize the heat load.
</ul>
<p>
The bottom line is that if you have an existing laser and don't know which
way to orient the crystal, select the one that works best. :)  If you're
designing a laser and need to select a crystal, all these factors need to
be taken into consideration.

<h3><A NAME="ssllpss">LED Pumped DPSS Laser?</A></h3>

There are some mighty powerful LEDs being produced these days.  How about
using one or more of them instead of laser diodes for the pump source?
<p>
For the purposes of Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> lasers, what would actually
be needed is more correctly called an IRED - Infra-Red Emitting Diode.  But
I will simply call them LEDs as that's what we all know and love.  Yes, an LED
pumped green laser pointer would still be a laser pointer but would contain
only one laser instead of two! :)
<p>
Unfortunately, for the most part, this isn't practical.  Here are some of the
problems:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Spectrum:</b> The emission spectra of an LED is much broader
 than that of a laser diode.  This means that less of its output power
 contributes to actual laser pumping, the rest gets expended as heat.
 This matters most with lasing mediums having narrow absorption bands like
 Nd:YAG but compared to a laser diode, <i>all</i> LEDs are broad spectrum
 emitters.  A typical 810 nm, 250 mW LED has a spectral width (FWHM) of 50 nm
 so much of the power would be wasted even for Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> which has
 quite a wide absorption band.
<p>
<li><b>Beam shaping:</b> LEDs are area emitters.  Single mode laser diodes
 have an effective emitting aperture of typically 1x3 um and their beam can
 be focused to a diffraction limited spot with minimal optics.  Multimode
 laser diodes are diffraction limited in the fast axis but have a flat top
 distribution in the slow axis.  For a 1 W laser diode, the emitting aperture
 is typically 1x100 um.  However, this is still much better than even a low
 power LED which may have an emitting area of 250x250 um.  High power LEDs
 are much worse.  A 250 mW LED may actually be 6 LED chips mounted on a
 common header.  Focusing such a broad area source to the small spot size
 required by end-pumped DPSS lasers may be impossible.  (The only approach
 that stands a chance would be to use a lens duct at perhaps $600 a pop!)
 However, there may be hope for side-pumped systems with banks of high power
 LEDs next to the rod or with cylindrical focusing optics.
<p>
<li><b>Power utilization:</b> LEDs are much less efficient than laser diodes.
 A typical 1 W laser diode may have an electrical to light output efficiency
 of better than 40 percent.  A similar LED would have an efficiency of only
 10 to 15 percent.  This is improving as the technology matures but in the
 end, the physics will still likely favor the laser diode.
<p>
<li><b>Cost:</b> High power LEDs are by no means inexpensive and never will
 be unless there is a high volume market for them.  In the 808 nm range, the
 only likely market would be for DPSS laser pumping - a sort of chicken and
 egg scenario.  Prices I've seen for 810 nm, 250 mW LEDs are around $30.  For
 880 nm (just an example, not useful for Nd laser pumping), 1 W LED arrays
 come in at more than $100.  However, there will be inexpensive (well,
 relatively at least) high power visible LEDs as they are developed for
 traffic signal and lighting applications.
</ul>
<p>
One advantage LEDs would have is in robustness.  They aren't as easily
damaged by current spikes or ESD!
<p>

<A HREF="http://www.roithner-laser.com/LED_diverse.htm">Roithner's Diverse LED
Page</A>.

<h3><A NAME="ssldprl">DPSS Ruby Laser?</A></h3>

There are two major issues preventing a DPSS ruby laser from ever likely being
anything more than a curiosity.
<p>
The more fundamental one is that ruby is a three-level lasing medium and is
virtually impossible to run Continuous Wave (CW), whether it's pumped with
arc lamps, high power laser diodes, or the Sun.  There never were and will
likely never will be any CW ruby lasers operating outside a research lab.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslcwr">CW Ruby Laser?</A>.
<p>
As a practical matter, the absorption bands of ruby (404 to 554 nm) do not
match any currently available high power laser diodes, which are in
the infra-red range - mostly around 808 nm and 980 nm.  There are some
relatively high power visible laser diodes but they are much more expensive
and at 635 nm and longer wavelengths.  Nichia violet and blue laser diodes
cover 400 nm to beyond 440 nm but are low power and currently very expensive.
<p>
Perhaps once violet or blue laser diodes are developed in high power
versions, the pumping situation will change, but the more fundamental
problems of CW efficiency won't go away.

<h3><A NAME="ssldmod">Direct Modulation of DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

While many low to medium power (e.g., up to 100 mW or more) DPSS lasers
which are often intended for laser show applications feature a modulation
input, what are the implications if it is actually controlling the pump
diode current?  Even assuming that the circuit is implemented with fail-safe
protection for the laser diode so that it is impossible to overdrive it either
intentionally or by accident, how good is this for the laser in general
and the pump diode specifically?
<p>
The answer is that it may be bad for a number of reasons and is certainly
not the preferred way of implementing high speed modulation of the laser
output.  The preferred way would be to use an Acousto Optic Modulator (AOM) and
have the laser itself run CW.  For example, the LWE-221 includes an AOM within
the laser head while the C315M, C532, and uGreen lasers are used with external
AOMs in their graphic arts applications such as high speed printing.
<p>
I've yet to see a modest power (e.g., 10 mW to 200 mW) green DPSS laser
that will modulate without changes in behavior including mode hopping
and significant significant power/efficiency variation.  If
it's not in constant power mode, there will won't be any sort of power
consistency.  If it's in constant power mode, then some of the time it's
going to require much higher pump power for the same output power as the
cavity requirements differ for low and high power operation due to thermal
effects in the crystals and resonator structure.  The C315M, C532, and uGreen
all require retuning of the cavity parameters when making major changes in
power.  And all three of these are considered very high quality lasers
but none of these provide modulation capability.  I shudder at the thought
of doing this to some of the imported junk that's out there.
<p>
An additional consideration is that the rapid thermal cycling of the pump
diode itself may have long term detrimental effects.  At modulation rates
up to a few hundred Hz, maybe a few kHz, the diode junction temperature
will be changing widely.  This can't be good for it in the long run.
However, at least one company doesn't see any problems:
<p>
And high speed modulation (above a few kHz) is simply not possible
using pump current.  The reason has to do with the upper state
lifetime of the lasing crystal (typically YAG or Vanadate for lasers
that we know and love) and the dynamics of the laser cavity.  In simplistic
terms, think of the 200 us or so upper state lifetime as a low pass filter
with a 5 kHz bandwidth.  Attempting to modulate the laser faster than
this will be futile.
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
There was a discussion some time ago whether diode lasers and
especially high-power diode bars could be modulated without a bad
effect on their lifetime. I asked that question to someone at
<A HREF="http://www.jold.com/">Jenoptik</A>. We bought two 30 W
fibre-coupled modules and one 140 W module from them. We haven't
used the large one yet, but so far we are very happy with the two
30 W modules.
<p>
In essence, they say that their diode bars can be modulated, as long
at the peak power does not exceed the rated cw power.  My discussions with
them was in but here is a brief and rough translation:
<p>
<ul>
<li>When the raw material for CW diodes is received by Jenoptik, they test
 a with a sample: pulse burn-in, 1s on, 1s off, then CW burn-in. 
<p>
<li>Only after the acceptable test results will the material be used for
 production.
<p>
<li>CW bars are good for pulsed operation up to their rated CW power,
 For example, a 30 W bar may be pulsed in any form up to 30 W peak.
<p>
 They do suggest not to go back to 0 A when off, go to just under the
 threshold current.
<p>
<li>Using the laser with peak powers above the rated CW power will reduce
 the lifetime.  Data on the reduction of lifetime is not available.
</ul>
<p>
Roland Gerhardt at Jenoptik was very helpful.  He may be contacted via the
Jenoptik Web site.

<h3><A NAME="sslfshft">Wavelength Shift of DPSSFD Laser</A></h3>

While the wavelength of laser diodes changes dramatically with temperature -
on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 nm/&deg;C - this is not directly coupled to either
the fundamental or frequency multiplied output in a DPSS laser.  The main
effect of the diode wavelength changing is varying pumping efficiency.
<p>
Any significant wavelength change of the output is caused by the longitudinal
mode shifting due to the cavity length changing as a result of thermal
expansion.  As a practical matter, this really only applies to single frequency
(single longitudinal mode) lasers.  With multiple longitudinal mode lasers,
the modes will still shift but as they move in one direction, others will
appear to fill in the gap at the opposite end of the gain curve.
<p>
As an example, a 1 to 5 mW green laser like that in a green laser pointer
with a discrete cavity will have an effective cavity length of around 10
millimeters.  For the 10 mm cavity, the free spectra range (FSR) - same as
longitudinal mode spacing - is about 15 GHz.  This is also the maximum shift
in frequency of the fundamental that can occur due to temperature changing
cavity length before the mode must hop to remain stable.  15 GHz at 1,064 nm
is about 1 part in 20,000 or 0.05 nm.  But once doubled to 532 nm, the
shift becomes only 0.025 nm.
<p>
However, for a lasers based on Multiple Chip Assemblies (MCAs) like the
Uniphase uGreen 4301, the cavity length could be much shorter, as little as
only 2 or 2.5 mm.  Then, the wavelength shift could exceed 0.1 nm.
<p>
On the other hand, higher power lasers with longer cavities will have
proportionally lower maximum wavelength shifts.  And when temperature
controlled, the wavelength will be very stable and predictable.

<h3><A NAME="sslandl">Amplitude Noise in DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

While the desired output of a CW laser is a constant optical power, this is
not true in many cases.  While the intensity may appear to be constant
with the unaided eye, send a sample to a photodiode and oscilloscope, and
the amplitude may be fluctuating wildly at all frequencies from DC to 100s
of MHz or more.
<p>
There are several sources of noise in lasers.  For the following, which
is just the tip of the iceberg, a green DPSS laser is assumed.
<p>
One of the unavoidable characteristics of the laser process is relaxation
oscillations.  These generally appear semi-chaotic with a center frequency
determined by the laser's design, including the gain medium, cavity length,
and losses.  For a short cavity microchip laser, a typical center
frequency is in the 100s of kHz to MHz range.  Relaxation oscillations
result in amplitude noise in the fundamental wavelength (e.g., 1,064 nm
for a 532 nm green laser).  They can be greatly reduced with a relatively
simple feedback loop using the output at the fundamental wavelength to
control the pump diode current.  However, this is rarely done in
commercial lasers, probably because the other major source of noise is
far more significant.
<p>
For a green or blue laser to be low noise requires first that it
operate single longitudinal and single transverse mode.  Otherwise,
there will be significant beating due to mode competition in the doubling
(e.g., KTP) crystal.  Since Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) is a non-linear
process, effects aren't easily predicted simply based on the difference
frequencies of the various modes.
<p>
The resulting possibly large amplitude fluctuations in the output has been
called the "green noise problem".
<p>
If nothing is done to make the laser single mode, it probably isn't
and will be subject to such effects.
<p>
Unidirectional ring lasers are substantially immune to the green noise
because they are inherently single longitudinal mode up to very high power.
However, Fabry-Perot (linear cavity) lasers may run multimode, especially if
they aren't very short.  Sometimes, the introduction of an SHG crystal
will force the laser to run single mode for reasons that are too complex
to go into here.  But this is far from guaranteed.  I've even seen wild
fluctuations in composite green laser pointer crystals that were supposed
to be CW.
<p>
High quality single frequency green lasers will typically spec the noise to
be less than 0.5 percent or better.  Lasers where nothing special has been
done could have amplitude swings of literally 100 percent (going to quasi-CW)
at some power levels.

<h3><A NAME="sslddl">DPSS or Diode Laser?</A></h3>

Some companies that import lasers - or even marketing departments of
real laser companies - seem to have no idea of the difference between
DPSS and direct diode laser technology.  So, catalog and Web site
charts and tables of laser specifications often lump multiple types
under a heading that doesn't apply to all of them.  For example, they
may all be called semiconductor lasers when some are in fact DPSS.
<p>
Even Edmund Industrial Optics lists (or used to, haven't checked recently)
lasers like 405 nm, 532 nm, 670 nm, 808 nm, and 1064 nm, under the same
heading, though they may have mentioned the differences in technology in
the text.
<p>
One tip-off is the tolerance spec on wavelength.  If it has something like
"+/- 5 nm", that's a diode laser, not DPSS.  Diode laser wavelengths are
rarely spec'd to better than 1 or 2 nm, even if carefully selected.  DPSS
wavelengths on the other hand are accurate and stable to better than 0.1 nm
so they may not have a tolerance at all.
<p>
However, there are some solid state lasing mediums like Erbium:Glass which
have a very wide gain bandwidth - 10s of nm - and thus the actual lasing
wavelength ends up being determined by the resonator and mirrors.
Fiber lasers would be a common example of this showing up commercially,
but mostly in telecom or industrial applications.
<p>
There may be a few directly (externally doubled diode lasers but these are
relatively unusual not likely in the low cost market since to get any sort
of efficiency requires a periodically poled doubler crystal like PPLN or
PPKTP, which are much higher priced.  However, if
<p>
And, there are several varieties of intracavity
doubled diode lasers.  These include the Coherent's OPSL (Optically Pumped
Semiconductor Laser) and  Novalux's VECSEL (Vertical External      
Cavity Surface Emitting Laser).  These can have any wavelength that's
either a fundamental or doubled diode wavelength.  See the chapter:
<A HREF="laserdio.htm#diotoc">Diode Lasers</A>.  These, too, are not
likely to be available as imports.

Some of these require special handling and storage, and protection once
installed in the equipment.  For example, ADP or KDP are hydroscopic (water
absorbing) so protection is critical.  However, KTP and LBO crystals are not
hydroscopic and thus less susceptible to damage from environmental conditions.

There are many others.  Here is one that may be useful - CDA:
<p>
(From: David Van Baak (dvanbaak@calvin.edu).)
<p>
CDA is Cesium Dihydrogen Arsenate, CsH<sub>2</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, and is
an isomorph of the well-known nonlinear crystal KDP, potassium dihydrogen
phosphate, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>.  My only reference to CDA is a
paper in JOSA B vol. 4, July 1987, pp. 1072 ff. which gives refractive
indices but not damage thresholds.
<p>
(From: William Buchman (billyfish@aol.com).)
<p>
You cannot just take any host crystal and dope it with any dopant.  The crystal
lattice spacing has to be able to accept the dopant.  YAG accepts neodymium
well enough, but corundum does not.  In fact, it does not like to hold a lot of
chromium either.  Yttrium is like a rare earth in the sense that adding any
additional protons to the nucleus produces a rare earth element.  That is why
Nd can fit albeit not all that well.

<h3><A NAME="sslcax">Instant Primer on Crystal Axis Terminology</A></h3>

Well, for Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (vanadate) and YLF at least. :)
<p>
(From: Christoph Bollig (laserpower@gmx.net).)
<p>
I think the most important is that a lot of the laser crystals are
uniaxial, so that (at least from an optics point of view) they have
only one special axis (the "optical axis") around which they are
symmetric. Vanadate and YLF are examples. For these crystals, the
optical axis is called "c" and the other two are "a". Normally, they
are cut in such a way that the c-axis is perpendicular to the laser
beam propagation.
<p>
The normal one is a-cut and the unusual one is c-cut, which
would mean the axis parallel to the laser beam counts for the name.

<h3><A NAME="sslktp">Types of KTP and Growth Methods</A></h3>

The Czochralski growth process commonly used for ruby, YAG, and many other
crystals is not suitable for KTP because the KTP material (KTiOPO<sub>4</sub>)
decomposes upon melting (about 1,150 &deg;C). Thus, other techniques must be
used.  Two are common: <b>flux</b> and <b>hydrothermal</b>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>With the flux growth process, a seed of KTP is heated in a flame, or in
 more modern setting, an RF induction furnace.  Powdered precursor material
 (ground up, non oriented powder) is poured on the seed crystal from above.
 The resulting boule is slowly lowered, such that the material being directly
 heated is the powder that was just poured on the seed crystal.  The materials
 at lower levels are slightly cooler, and form a single crystal oriented in
 direction as the seed.
<p>
<li>In the hydrothermal technique, crystals are grown from seeds in aqueous
 solutions of KTP at elevated temperature and pressure.  This is the high-tech
 version of the sugar crystal growth experiments you did in grade school.
 No, you probably can't make optical quality KTP in your kitchen!  I don't
 know the exact conditions for growing KTP but the typical hydrothermal
 process requires a temperature of 350 &deg;C and a pressure of 170
 atmospheres in apparatus that can withstand very corrosive materials! :)
 There is a new book devoted to this topic if you are really curious:
 "Handbook of Hydrothermal Technology: Technology for Crystal Growth and
 Materials Processing", William Andrew Publishing.
</ul>

There are actual physical differences in the resulting crystal, mostly due to
the fact that the flux method changes the precursors a bit.  Flux grown
material is physically softer and more prone to damage, both from laser light
and mechanical handling, and is also more susceptible to grey tracking (a type
of ion migration, reversible by annealing).  Hydrothermal KTP is more
efficient, especially at the highest powers.  The phase matching angle
for Type-II interaction is also slightly different for the two types: As
measured in the X axis from the XY plane, it is 21 degrees for flux grown and
26 degrees for hydrothermal (since the crystals will have been cut
appropriately before you see them, this really isn't much of a concern for
laser builders though).
</ul>

To provide an idea of cost: A prime quality flux grown 3 x 3 x 5 mm KTP
crystal is a few hundred dollars while a hydrothermal crystal of the same
size would be about $1,000 MORE.  The KTP on the
<A HREF="http://www.sro-optics.com/">Sterling Resale Optics</A> Web site would
go for about $2,000 new.
<A HREF="http://www.synoptix.com/">Litton/Airtron/Synoptix</A> (now
part of Northrup Grumman) is the only
company I know of making hydrothermal KTP.  I don't think it's because of
patent issues but rather that no one else wants to invest the capital in
making the stuff.

<h3><A NAME="sslpow">Pump Range, Output Wavelengths, and Thresholds for
 Various Materials</A></h3>

The following data has been tabulated from various sources by Stephen Costaras
(stevecs@chaven.com).
<p>
The data is interpreted as follows: The threshold values for a particular
material are the energy input needed at a particular temperature (noted in
degrees Kelven) at the listed region of pump wavelengths in order to lase
rod 2" to 3" long and 0.3" to 0.5" in diameter of the specified material.
I used a resonant cavity from an old ruby laser that was modified to allow 
n incoming pump beam.  I remember it was a real pain to get even illumination
without much loss/feedback.
<p>
For example, in order to lase
CaWO<sub>4</sub>:Nd<sub>3</sub>,+ you need a pump laser with output wavelength
at 570 to 600 nm with at least 3 J of output power at room temperature (295K).
<p>
Tests were done at three temperatures: Room temperature of 295K (~72F), 77K
using liquid nitrogen to cool the materials, and 20K for some.

<h3><A NAME="sslcclc">Color of Common Lasing Crystals</A></h3>

The actual color can vary quite a bit depending on dopant concentration
and any co-dopants that may be present.  The following is very approximate:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Alexandrite - Pale brown tint, round.
<li>GSGG - Green, round.
<li>Er:Glass (Erbium:Glass), Er:LiNbO3 (Erbium:Lithium Niobate) - Pale pink,
 round.
<li>Er:YAG (Erbium:YAG) - Pale green.  Round.
<li>Ho:YAG (Holmium:YAG) - Yellow/green.  Round.
<li>Nd:YAG (Neodymium:YAG) - Very light purple tint (low doped for CW) or
 pinkish-purple (higher doped for pulsed).  Color will tend to change under
 different types of lighting conditions.  Round.
<li>Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> (Neodymium:Yttrium Vanadate) - Blue tint.  Birefringent
 and thus usually rectangular (not round).
<li>Ruby - Pink to red.  Round.
</ul>
<p>
Due to the narrow absorption bands of these materials, their actual color
will be heavily dependent on the light source used and will appear very
different under incandescent and fluorescent illumination.

found that I needed a very large amount of pump energy to get to threshold.
We could get big pulses out of Nd:YAG or Nd:Glass with a pair of capacitors
smaller than my thumb, but the ruby required caps the size of beer cans.
Low Chromium ion concentrations make for lower thresholds.  I would also
caution you that the lamp should be close to the rod or else the cavity should
have highly reflective ends.  Elliptical reflectors have very different
magnification near side versus far side, so focusing extended objects gives
very different results than you would suspect by ray tracing a line source.
Using a small eccentricity in your ellipse can help minimize this effect.
We always got better results with close-coupling in a cylindrical-segment
cavity than in an elliptical cavity.

<h3><A NAME="sslqar">Pulsed Ruby Laser Questions and Comments</A></h3>

Here are some assorted questions along the lines of: "I have such-and-such
a ruby rod and want to make a laser".

<blockquote>
"I have 2 ruby rods - one is 3" long, 1/4" diameter, other is 3.5" long, 1/8"
 diameter.  The 3" one is high quality (got from a university), and the 3.5"
 one is "dodgy", but i would like to try and get it lo lase. The 3" one is
 almost clear, and a HeNe laser beam going through it is barely affected
 (looks the same brightness after going through). The 3.5" rod is almost
 opaque, and decreases the brightness of a HeNe beam quite a lot. The 3" one
 will allow the beam created to go through it more easily, but the 3.5" rod
 will give off more light when excited.
<p>
 How does this opacity affect the use of the rod in a laser?  Will the 3.5"
 one need more input/give higher output?"
</blockquote>

<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
I think that I am familiar with the ruby rods that you have. The 3" polished
rod should "lase" without any problem in a suitable cavity. The fact that the
sides of the rod are polished will affect the pump light distribution in the
rod and would tend to cause some central focusing, especially in an elliptical
pumping cavity. This is a quite complicated phenomenon which depends on many
factors besides the cylindrical surface finish of the rod, including optical
thickness and pumping geometry.
<p>
Your other "dodgy" rod with the matt finished cylindrical surface will give a
more uniform pump light distribution under certain circumstances.  The most
important parts of the laser rod is of course the quality of the ends. The
ends must be precisely polished to a high degree and anti-reflection coated
for best performance in a laser cavity. You are likely assuming that the
unpolished rod is "giving off" more light, but this is mainly the effects of
diffusion from the unpolished ends. This rod will not work in any type of
laser cavity unless the ends have been suitably polished and over-coated.
This would be very difficult to achieve oneself without the proper facilities
and equipment.
<p>
<blockquote>
"I have an old ruby laser, with everything except the power supply. The
 flashlamp has a 3" arc length, and about 3 or 4 mm diameter. I have been
 told that for optimum performance, i will need a capacitor (or bank) rated
 1,200V at 300-400uF (BIG!!!) does anyone know what the minimum capacitor
 might be to still cause lasing action? (3" ruby rod, 1/4" diameter)."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
I have a ruby laser of the same dimensions, but I have no way of knowing if
our flashlamps are equivalent. Anyway, my capacitor has to be charged to
about 90 joules in order to achieve laser action (with a pulse width of 250
us). With a 1,200 volt charge on the capacitor this would mean a capacitance
of least 125 uF. Don't forget the proper pulse forming network.

<h3><A NAME="sslerg">John's Notes on Er:YAG Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Johnathan Leppert (leppertjle@excite.com).)
<p>
We had a medical Er:YAG given to us awhile ago which was still mostly
functional. Wasn't diode pumped, but the research I did on it to refurb it to
maximum op, I remember a few things. The upper state pumping is at 970 nm.
Suitable diode pumping can be had with InGaAs diodes with around 30% to 40%
diode to Er:YAG efficiency. In this mode it usually runs at 2,937 - 2,940 nm.
<p>
The above is considering pulsed.  If you want CW, you should pump at 790 nm
with something like AlGaAs diodes (I think...???).  This gives you something
closer to 3 um, but isn't quite as efficient.
<p>
I'ms not sure about this crystal's thermal properties, but I do know the laser
we had was very sensitive toward room temperature. In the morning, when the
air system was becoming stable after standby at night, sometimes we couldn't
even start it. In the afternoon, when the room was fixed at 75.4 F, it worked
better. I'ms not sure if this was because there was something wrong with it, or
what, but it was even more sensitive than my open-air Diode
+ Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> + KTP 532 nm laser, which was very poorly thermally
managed.

<h3><A NAME="sslcwr">CW Ruby Laser?</A></h3>

It seems that few people are content with a pulsed laser when they realize that
most of the time, nothing is happening and they figure that much greater
output power should be possible.  Well, at least for ruby, it is extremely
difficult and any claims to the contrary (from suppliers of laser parts)
should be taken for what they're worth - which isn't much. :)
<p>
<blockquote>
"Having spent some time with gas and 4 level (YAG) laser systems, I am
 contemplating CW pumping a ruby rod with a linear arc lamp and a Q-Switch. I
 realize that being a three level laser, it is significantly less efficient
 than YAG etc. The ruby I have is 6" long and 5/8" in diameter.
<p>
 Has anybody any experience with doing this and what sort of input power
 is needed/possible?"

<p>
I'd hate to see that massive pretty ruby rod thermal dynamically explode but
if you do put this together use a video camera so we can all get a glimpse of
the death and funeral. I read somewhere that a lab did have moderate success
with a CW ruby cavity however they used an incredibly small rod and were
pumping it with other than a arc lamp (huge heat and waste energy), anybody
else have an opinion?
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Yeah, the only CW ruby laser I have ever seen data on was a liquid nitrogen
(LN2) cooled little cube of ruby pumped by a 5 watt argon ion laser.  The
output power was <b>very</b> low even with LN2 for cooling. You're gonna blow
that rod into smithereens.  Ruby doesn't shed heat well, nor does it like CW
pumping.   You might find yourself depopulating the storage with your arc
light as fast as you can store the energy, so no lasing. Try YAG instead.
You'd get a 10 fold increase in output power anyways. 
<p>
I did see a color picture of a cryo cooled ruby cube pumped by a focused
large-frame argon ion laser,  maybe early seventies, but I don't have a
reference. They did have the beam paths shown in smoke - you could just see
the faint red beam in the picture.
<p>
(From: William Buchman (billyfish@aol.com).)
<p>
I am not familiar with this particular configuration.
<p>
You do, however, have to distinguish between pink ruby, the standard ruby laser
material, and red ruby. Pink ruby can operate as a three level laser at room
temperature.  Cryogenic may be used to transfer heat. Red ruby, on the other
hand, can operate on satellite lines at somewhat longer wavelength as a four
level laser. It requires a cryogenic temperature to achieve population
inversion.
<p>
Four level lasers have relatively low thresholds so as not to have the final
laser state be the same as the ground state.  This greatly lowers the
threshold. Neodymium lasers are an example. There are other such crystals.
Calcium fluoride doped with uranium is one such. It has to be cooled, however
to thermally separate the final laser state from the ground state.
<p>
For ruby lasers, it is necessary, neglecting various degeneracies, to excite
more than half the ions from the ground state in order to exceed threshold and
keep it there. It can be done. It was done for the first ruby laser. Keeping
the concentration of chromium ion down helps.  That is why ruby has 0.01% to
0.02% while neodymium runs at 1% if that much can be kept in the crystal
structure.
<p>
However, ruby does not run truly CW like a well behaved electronic crystal
oscillator.  The optical oscillator squegges in a series of pulses like a self
excited super regenerative detector.
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
The original experiments on CW ruby pumping were done with high-pressure
long-arc, mercury vapor lamps. Maximum input power was 560 W/cm. A small one
inch long by 0.079 inch diameter ruby rod was pumped periodically at a maximum
repetition rate of 110 Hz and a maximum output energy of 2 watts was obtained.
I would doubt that you could continuously pump such a large rod as you have
described.
<p>
A CW ruby laser was indeed built and reported by V. Evtuhov in a 1967
article in the Journal of Applied Physics. From: "Solid-State Laser
Engineering" (Koechner):
<p>
<blockquote>
"A CW-pumped ruby laser, which used a rod 2 mm in diameter and 50 mm in
 length, generated an output of 1.3 watts at an input of 2.9 kW. Only a small
 part of the crystal's cross-section was excited by the filament arc, and
 lasing action occurred only in the small volume of 6 x 10<sup>-3</sup>
 cm<sup>3</sup>. Using this value, the lamp input power per unit volume of
 active material required to obtain threshold is approximately
 230 kW/cm<sup>3</sup>. The main reason for the poor efficiency was the low
 absorption of useful pump light by the small lasing volume."
</blockquote>
<p>
A capillary mercury arc lamp was used as the pump source, operated at
200 atmospheres. These types of high pressure mercury arc lamps produce
a spectral output which coincides very well with the absorption spectrum
of ruby.
<p>
(From: Michael Andrus (andrus@ccountry.net).)
<p>
Ruby is self limiting so even if you used an arc lamp you have a semi-CW
beam.  As others have said cooling these lasers is a chore.  I have a ruby
operating at 1 pulse every 5 seconds and it gets <b>HOT</b>.  If you liquid
cooled a small rod you could build a power supply that could run a flash lamp
at 50 Hz which would be far more efficient than an arc lamp.  Your PSU would
have to be in the kW range though.  If it is high poer you need go with YAG,
but if you want visible, try a YAG pumped KTP.
<p>
(From: William Buchman (billyfish@aol.com).)
<p>
A CW ruby laser was indeed reported by Bell Labs. I think it was first
published in Apllied physics letters, possibly by Nassau and Boyd.
<p>
The laser was made from a single piece sapphire grown so that one cylindrical
portion was doped to form ruby while attached to it was a clear sapphire cone.
It was end pumped so that light was collected by total internal reflection in
the cone. I believe that the rod was immersed in liquid oxygen which in turn
was cooled by liquid nitrogen. The light source was an arc lamp.  It operated
on the same transition as room temperature ruby. The low temperature did
narrow the linewidth thereby lowering the threshold. The laser was run barely
above threshold.
<p>
(From: Stephen Swartz (sds@world.std.com).)
<p>
When I was a graduate student in the University of Colorado's JILA
program, we actually built a cw ruby laser in the late '80s. No published
work came out of it but I can tell you the laser rod was about 1-2 cm
long AR coated on on side an brewester cut on the other. The pump source
was a 10 watt argon-ion laser and to make the thing work the ruby
crystal had to be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. This has the
effect of thermally depopulating the upper part of the ruby's ground
state so the laser can act like a 4 level laser. Efficiency was not too
great but it did glow a pretty cherry red. This type of laser has been
published in the literature several times but I can't think of where
just now.

<h3><A NAME="sslzzc">What is a Zig-Zag Crystal?</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
A zig-zag crystal is a rectangular crystal with both the ends polished as well
as two of the sides.  Conventionally, the top and bottom are used for
cooling and the pump light enters the crystal from the polished sides and
the lasing mode zig-zags through the crystal using total internal refraction.
Obviously, the pump beams and the lasing mode occupy the same 'plane' in the
crystal.
<p>
What makes these things such a pain to work with is the fact that you have to
not only have cavity mirrors aligned to the lasing mode, but you have to have
the mode 'entrance angle' aligned to what the pump crystal was engineered for,
so that it exits the crystal at the proper angle after X number of bounces.
<p>
The only good thing about this design, other than the rather simple way pump
light is coupled into the crystal, is the fact that the thermal lensing is
unaxial, and can be fairly easily predicted and compensated for. The zig-zag
was one of the first commercially available diode pumped systems.
Spectra-Physics came out with what they called a "TFR", tightly folded laser,
referring to the zig-zag nature of the lasing crystal.

<h3><A NAME="sslcel">Comments on Erbium Lasers</A></h3>

(From: William Smith (frostybeard@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Er:Glass lases at 1.535 um and Er:YAG lases at 2.94 um.
<p>
From what I have seen, mirrors for Er:YAG are frightfully expensive, I suppose
due to the long wavelength compared with Nd:Yag at 1064 nm.  Maybe CO2 mirrors
would work with Er:YAG if they are not extremely wavelength-specific. CO2
mirrors can be found for a reasonable price.  The CO2 mirrors I have seen have
been gold or copper, so they would work. Get one that is extremely reflective
(as close to 100% as possible) for the mirror and one that is about 80 %
reflective for the output coupler, if you have an Er:YAG.
<p>
I have an Er:glass rod, so I have been finding out a lot about Erbium
lasers. I just ordered a mirror and output coupler from
<A HREF="http://www.alkor.net/">Alkor Technologies</A> (Russia).
<p>
Erbium is a good first solid state laser project. Erbium is a so-called
eye-safe laser, since the longer wavelength does not penetrate the eye to the
retina. However, it can burn your cornea! So be careful. You have no hope of
seeing any light from it. The wavelength is too long.
<p>
Use a xenon strobe light at about 1 Hz to pump it, unless you are q-switching
it. Then you can pump it with a higher repetition rate. You can also use laser
diode pumping at 980 nm. It is not a good idea to pump glass CW, because glass
is not a good thermal conductor and can be rather easily damaged by heat.

<h3><A NAME="sslnrc">Natural Ruby Crystal for Solid State Laser?</A></h3>

Aside from the problem of finding a large enough chunk of natural ruby at
a price affordable by a small country, the optical quality and doping level
are not likely to be acceptable.  Despite the inflated prices for gemstones,
their uniformity and freedom from impurities may be quite poor.  The doping
level of natural ruby is also likely to be much higher than desirable for a
laser crystal.  This would result in a much higher threshold, if it can be
made to lase at all.  See the section:
<p>
From the CORD course on laser technology:
<p>
<blockquote>
 "Synthetic rubies, made for jewelry, are usually doped with 0.5% chromium
 oxide (by weight), producing a very deep red material. The chromium doping
 in red ruby is much too high for laser crystals. Experience has shown that
 optimum laser operation occurs with "pink" ruby where the doping is
 0.03% to 0.05% chromium oxide, depending upon the manner in which the ruby is
 to be pumped and the type of operation desired."
</blockquote>

So, your spouse can rest easy that her rock won't be recycled into a hobbyist
laser. :)

<h3><A NAME="sslcpd">Choice of Lamp Pumped or Diode Pumped Solid State Laser</A></h3>

(From: Martin Sharp (martinsharp@btconnect.com).)
<p>
Lamp pumping is the older technology, and uses inert gas filled lamps, which
have to be replaced every 500 to 2,000 hours. Diode pumped lasers use laser
diodes to excite the YAG crystal.  Diodes last much longer, lifetimes seem
to be quoted at 30,000 hours or so. But they are far more expensive than
flashlamps.
<p>
The two big advantages of Diode pumping are in electrical efficiency and
laser beam quality. Lamps generate a lot of heat and the overall efficiency
is low. This means you would be looking at a three-phase electrical supply,
and a water chiller for the system.  With diode pumping it is possible to get
a laser which will mark metal that can run off single phase and is air-cooled.
<p>
Because of the heat generated by the lamps, the YAG crystal distorts and the
resultant laser beam has a lower beam quality -
this means that it cannot  be so easily focussed to a small spot. Again the
diode pumped laser does not suffer this problem.
<p>
So what about power? Well a typical lamp pump laser will generate 75 to 100 W
of continuous light output power. For many metal marking applications you
would use the laser in CW mode (continuous). For some metals, and other
materials, you need to pulse the beam using a Q-switch. Each pulse has a
very high power, but is low in energy. The product of the pulse energy and
pulse frequency (typically 1 to 20 kHz) gives you the average power, and
this will be less than the CW power say 50 to 75 W (or less) because of the
pulsing.
<p>
Now, to achieve these powers, the laser beam is run with a multi (transverse)
mode beam, again a beam quality factor. Multimode beams don't focus as well
as single mode beams (i.e., they have a larger focal spot size). Why is focal
spot size important? The laser power divided by the focal spot area
is a measure of intensity, and the higher the intensity, the crisper, darker
and possibly faster the laser mark will be. You can increase the intensity
by increasing the power, or by decreasing the spot size. So reducing the
spot size is important, and this can be achieved by increasing the beam
quality. This can be done in a YAG laser by putting apertures inside the
laser, and this converts the laser beam to single mode, hence better beam
quality.
<p>
However the power is reduced. So the 75 W multimode laser above becomes say a
10 or 12 W single mode laser, but the resultant increase in intensity may be
beneficial.
<p>
Now diode pumped lasers inherently have better beam quality anyway, but
their raw power is still limited (but increasing). Even at lower powers
they may produce better marks.

<h3><A NAME="ssltls">Thermal Lensing in SS Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
Thermal lensing is a generic term used to describe the effects of heat on a
laser medium.  With reference to DPSS lasers, there are two main ways that
thermal lensing can be evident.  With an end-pumped arrangement, you can get
the face of the laser crystal to bulge outward due to localized heating, and
thermal expansion (remember you may not be using a high power pump diode, but
it is focused well, meaning you have some pretty substantial power densities
at the pump beam waist).  Interestingly, this effect can be alleviated by
sandwiching the DPSS crystal between two pieces of sapphire, and applying a
high pressure to the crystal faces.  The sapphire does not absorb the pump
light to any extent, and since sapphire is a very strong, hard crystal.  It
does not allow the vanadate, YAG, etc., to deform significantly.
<p>
The second kind of thermal lensing is the more classical type of lensing that
refers to the temperature gradient in the laser rod or crystal.  Since the
inner part of the laser crystal is heated by pump light, and only the outer
surface is cooled, there is a temperature gradient formed that causes a weak
change in the index of refraction.  This can by symmetrical around the axis
of a rod, where you get spherical thermal lensing, or in the case of a cube
of vanadate, you can get cylindrical thermal lensing, if the cube has
heatsinking on two sides.
<p>
So, when is thermal lensing a problem?  Unfortunately, there is no simple
answer to that question. it's a case by case sort of thing, all depending on
host, pump power, pump power density, cooling, ambient temperature, resonator
design, and the list goes on and on.  But thermal lensing is not always a
bad thing, sometimes it is actually used in the design process of a laser
and required for proper operation.  For example, the newer Continuum pulsed
YAG lasers are set up to run with a certain amount of thermal lensing.
The lasers normally have an adjustable rep rate from 1 to 50 Hz. When the user
wants to run the laser at 1 Hz, the flashlamps still fire at full power, at
50 Hz, but the q-switch is only gated once a second. this is because the
laser was designed to run stably with the thermal load that would be
present when the laps were firing at 50 Hz. that particular laser would NOT
operate properly with reduced thermal lensing if the lamps were fired less
often (that's normally the reverse of how things happen - normally less
lensing is good, more is bad).
<p>
Which brings up a related question:
<p>
When determining the focal length of a Nd:YAG rod while operating under a
heat load from the lamps/diodes, I normally use a secondary YAG laser and
simply measure the focal length of the rod. I remember seeing a reference to
making focal length measurements by using various placements of the rod in a
laser cavity but don't recall the procedure.  (I'ms trying to help a buddy out
who wants to measure the focal length of a rod, but doesn't really have any
type of 'tools'.)
<p>
(From: A. E. Siegman" (siegman@stanford.edu).)
<p>
You may be thinking of journal articles that calculate the Gaussian mode 
spot size, mode stability and other mode parameters in a YAG laser using 
standard ABCD techniques and treating the thermal focusing in the rod as 
an equivalent thin lens at the center of the rod.  
<p>
There have been several of these published but I believe they were all
concerned with evaluating the effects of thermal focusing on the laser mode,
rather than on using this the other way, to measure the thermal focal length.  
One result from these is that there can be special locations within a 
laser cavity where the mode size is to first order independent of the 
thermal focusing.
<p>
The rule of thumb for thermal focusing in YAG rods is about 0.5 to 1 diopter
(f in meters = 1/d) per kW of power into the pump lamps, more or less
independent of rod dimensions -- right?
<p>
If your friend can measure laser performance with, say, a flat/flat 
cavity over a wide enough pump power range that the cavity goes 
unstable and the laser goes out -- or just carefully measure mode spot 
size versus pump power in any cavity -- I'd think it would be possible to 
deduce the focal length versus pump power to reasonable accuracy by 
comparing mode theory to experimental results.

<h3><A NAME="sslco2">CO2 Gas Input to SS Laser</A></h3>

(From: Richard Everett <reverett@newtonlabs.com).)
<p>
If it is a medical 100 watt yag laser like mine, the CO2 is used to keep the
blood and guts off of the optics at the probe end of the fiber.  Very gross,
and I don't really want to think about where it has been.
<p>
On my unit, when you open the side panel, you can see the CO2 line going
straight through from the back of the unit near the power cords to the front
of the unit near the fiber output.

<h3><A NAME="ssltdl">Thin Disk High Power Solid State Lasers</A></h3>

While most high power solid state lasers have used laser medium in the shape
of rods or slabs, a new trend is emerging where a very thin piece of highly
doped Nd:YAG or other material is end or side-pumped by one or more laser
diodes or laser diode arrays.  The typical thickness of the lasing medium
is 10 to 500 <i>microns</i> (0.01 to 0.5 millimeter).  Amazingly, the output
power from such a small sliver can be 10s of WATTs, 100s of WATTs, or
even potentially much more!  What makes this possible and desirable
include the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Excellent heat transfer:</b> The front and/or back of the disk can be
 bonded to an excellent heatsink like copper (with a tiny hole in the middle if
 necessary) or diamond.  Due to the thinness of the disk, heat transfer
 from its interior is very high.
<p>
<li><b>Ease of pumping:</b> The pump spot can be easily tailored to the
 desired beam shape without worrying too much about divergence since the
 depth of focus can be very short.  The use of the thin disk essentially
 reduces this from a 3 to a 2 dimensional problem.  Pumping can be from the
 back, or from the front off-axis or via a 45 degree mirror.  Multiple
 pump sources can easily be accomodated.
<p>
<li><b>Little to no thermal lensing effects:</b> The thin disk in contact with
 a good heatsink reduces the amount of thermal lensing due to heating in the
 gain medium.
<p>
<li><b>Single longitudinal mode operation:</b> The short length of the gain
 medium almost assures that only a single longitudinal mode will oscillate
 if the HR mirror is on the rear face of the disk.
<p>
<li><b>Potential for compact construction:</b> Compared to other
 geometries, the thin disk is much more easily designed into a small
 space.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="sslfib">Solid State Fiber Lasers</A></h3>

At the other extreme from the thin disk laser is the fiber laser.  A
pump source, usually one or more high power laser diodes or bars, is
coupled into a doubly-clad optical fiber with the gain medium, cavity, and
mirrors, all being formed within the fiber.  A single mode core, doped
with a rare earth element like ytterbium is the gain medium.  The fiber
is clad such that the pump source is coupled into the outer multimode
core where the light propagates down the fiber with multiple internal
reflections whose path passes through the single mode core gain medium
thousands of times until it is virtually all absorbed.  Mirrors are
generally of the bragg grating variety so the cavity is entirely contained
within the fiber.  The technology is similar to erbium laser amplifiers
and Raman amplifiers.  Although fiber laser research dates to the 1980s,
the first commercial systems appeared in the 1990s.
<p>
Fiber lasers have several notable benefits compared to rod, disk, or other
technologies.  The optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of
fiber lasers is typically 60 to 70 percent compared to 30 to 40 percent
for other DPSS lasers and only 5 percent or less for lamp pumped
solid state lasers.  Higher efficiency translates into lower wall
plug power, and less waste heat and reduced cooling requirements.
This further benefits from the distributed gain
medium allowing air cooling to be easily used in place of water cooling.
With the laser already being a fiber, delivery systems can be simplified
with the reduction of coupling losses and contamination issues.
<p>
Single mode power as high as 100 W has been reported with multimode power
in the several KILOWATTs range.  (Winter 2004.)
<p>
Applications include reprographics, marking, cutting, engraving, heat
treatment, and many others.
<p>
(From: Richard Budd (Richbudd@sbcglobal.net).)
<p>
Advantages: Generally, the mode from a Yb-fiber laser is inherently Gaussian
and stable over power/time.  So no aperture is needed and it won't change as
power is ramped like a YAG does.
<p>
Disadvantages: Not yet capable of multi-joule sub-ms pulsing.
<p>
The diodes last forever because the pump diodes are originally designed for 
telecom usage and each fiber laser uses LOTS of them - both SPI and IPG were 
originally telecom laser diode manufacturers and after the long-haul fiber
optic market became fully built out they needed another place to sell their
laser diodes.  Considering the LDs were designed to be buried underground or
dropped into the deep oceans lifetime is #1 priority. Life was mainly archived
by heavily derating them as well as using more-expensive internal construction
materials.  A typical pump LD in SPI's lasers emits up to 10 watts but can
easily output well over 50w for a few thousand hours.
<p>
DPSS YAG lasers use much higher power LDs. Smaller and simpler package but
also a lot less lifetime.
<p>
As for building your own, this is highly unlikely.  The mirrors are Bragg
gratings that are etched onto the precisely cleaved ends of the active
fibers themselves.  Then there's the matter of coupling the LDs to the
fiber.  IPG is big on end-pumping the fiber but also have problems blowing
the end off the fiber at high powers, whereas SPI uses very low-angle fiber
combiner technology to spread out the pump energy over almost the entire fiber.
<p>
Because the Yb-fiber wavelengths are very close to a YAG's (1,060 to 1,090nm
for fiber vs 1,064 nm for YAG), material processing results, optics and safety
gear used are all the same.
<p>
I highly recommend the SPI lasers.  At ~$20k their lower average power but
very high peak power GT line are quite reasonable in cost and are about the
size of a thick book.

As a university tech handed a pile of pieces, here's some of what
I would be asking.  Note that my experience is with ion (Ar/Kr), N2, and dye
lasers with a smattering of YAG and CO2. Mind you I would not ask a
professor all these questions in one setting.  You might come across as
a smart ass.  Or, rather, you might simply ask the professor in charge to
point you to the grad student who actually worked with it.
<p>
<ol>
<li>What do you have for a pump laser?  Argon ion?  Doubled YAG?  How
 many watts?  CW, Q-switched, or mode-locked?
<p>
<li>What did the other lab do with the Ti:Sapph?
<p>
<li>Are there missing pieces?  For example, does the resonator form a complete
 loop? Do you have it on a breadboard or mounting plate?  Are there "shadows"
 or "Footprints" of missing pieces on the breadboard?
<p>
<li>How long has the laser been in storage?
<p>
<li>What do you have in support electronics and test equipment?  For example:
 oscilloscope, fast photosensor, wattmeter, pockels cell driver, etc.
<p>
<li>Do you have access to software such as Scifinder Scholar to get
 access to any papers related to the laser or at least that type of
 laser?
<p>
<li>Did the other lab mention any specs, such as Kerr Lens mode
 locking, femtosecond pulsed or CW, pulse picking, Faraday rotator? Did they
 use words such as "real dog", "pain in the a**", impossible to adjust",
 "never stays in alignment for the time it takes to turn your back",
 "glad to be rid of it", "hope YOU can use it", etc.?
<p>
<li>Is there someone from the original lab that used the laser?
<p> 
<li>Do the optics look good?  Are the rod faces burned, scratched,
 discolored, or missing chunks?  Same for Brewster windows or other
 optics as appropriate.
<p>
<li>Do you have past experience as a laser jock, and are you on good
 relations with a laboratory machinist?
<p>
<li>Was it tuned using birefringence?  Grating?  Prism (hopefully not a
 prism)?
<p>
<li>Do you have any paperwork, i.e., manuals, chewed up dog eared notebook
 (or chewed up by dog), drawings, schematics. etc.?
</ol>
<p>
Depending on your answers to these, one would decide to start from
scratch or rebuild it.  The former is often easier.

<h3><A NAME="sslerf">Early Ruby Laser Rangefinder</A></h3>

(From: Axel Kanne (axel.k@home.se).)
<p>
According to a book I have (the 100 year anniversary book for the
Swedish Coastal Defense), Sweden had the world's first series produced
laser for military use (a rangefinder entering service in 1968).
<p>
It used a ruby laser, was Class 4, and probably had a range of at least 15 
km based on the Dmax of the artillery systems that used it. It was 
definitely NOT eye-safe, the naked eye peacetime safety range was 9 km. With 
binoculars this was upwards of 40 km.
<p>
I found a picture of it at: 
<A HREF="http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/f/femore_fort/index1.html">Femore
Fort (Femvrefortet), Sweden</A>, middle of the page.
When the museum mentioned in the text opens again next summer I'll try to 
get some pictures of my own.
<p>
This rangefinder was called AML 701 and was made by Ericsson, probably well 
into the 70s (A Nd:YAG based system called AML 702 appeared in 1978 or so). 
Both fixed and mobile versions seems to have been available, with some 
(70s) fixed versions mounted in an armored cupola along with a TV camera.
The Coast Artillery's laser rangefinders were used as secondary ranging 
systems (radar being primary) and replaced various optical systems used 
since the early 20th century.
<p>
Safety data is from "Safety Instruction, 2000" which is a publication 
regarding peacetime safety procedures in the Swedish defense forces. It's 
publicly available (in Swedish of course) on the Net but in the latest 
edition (2004) this system has been removed. The chapter on laser safety is 
actually quite good and there are even several examples of warning labels 
(in Swedish) available as JPGs, and how to label laser equipment based on 
their class.

<h2>Micro Laser Rangefinder Using Disposable Flash Pumped Nd:YAG and OPO</h2>

See the paper: <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lr/">Micro-Laser
Range Finder</A> for a complete description (along with cool graphics and
photos) of this system.  It uses the flash unit from a Kodak 'MAX' single-use
(disposable) 35 mm camera (slightly modified to permit control from a PIC as
the pump source for a passively Q-switched Nd:YAG rod with an OPO to generate
an eye-safe beam.  See the section: <A HREF="laserssc.htm#sscuyag">Power
Supply for Micro Yag Laser (uYAG)</A> for information on the power supply.
