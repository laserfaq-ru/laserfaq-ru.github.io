<h2>Basic Home-Built N2 Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cn2cn20">Introduction to Home-Built N2 Laser</A></h3>

The nitrogen (N2) laser produces intense extremely short (a few ns) intense
(100 kW typical) pulses of light in the near UV portion of the E/M spectrum
(337.1 nm being the dominent line).  Despite this impressive capability, the
N2 laser is among the easiest to construct for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>NO glass working is required.  The laser cavity is a Plexiglas box!
<p>
<li>It runs at a relatively high pressure (low vacuum) - typically 100 to 200
 Torr and some can be made to even work at full atmospheric pressure.
<p>
<li>Mirrors are NOT required.  The gain of the lasing medium (N2) is so high
 that one pass through the discharge chamber is sufficient to produce an
 intense coherent UV pulse.  A totally reflecting mirror of almost any type
 as long as it reflects UV can be added at the far end of the chamber to
 double the output if desired.  All it is doing is reflecting the half of the
 beam that would be otherwise lost out the other end of the box.  In fact, a
 true resonator with a pair of mirrors would not help much at all.  The lasing
 process is self limiting so all the exciting action is over in a few
 nanoseconds!
<p>
<li>The basic pulse power supply is very simple and not terribly dangerous (in
 a relative sort of way compared to most other home-built lasers).  A higher
 performance (and more dangerous) power supply is an option to boost average
 power but is not required.
<p>
<li>The gas fill can be just plain old nitrogen and the purity grade available
 from welding suppliers is more than adequate.
</ul>
<p>
Compared to all the other home-built lasers, the nitrogen laser also likely
has the lowest risk of failure <b>IFF you stay pretty close to the SciAm
design</b>, more below.  No glass working, no mirrors, mirror mounts,
or mirror alignment, minimal vacuum.  Despite this, what you end up with isn't
substantially inferior to a commercial unit costing many kilobucks.  It just
lacks the convenience features and other bells and whistles.  Now, the UV
output isn't in a tight high quality beam like that of an HeNe or CO2 laser
but it is a real laser.  So, despite the high peak power, due to the lack
of beam quality, the N2 laser isn't going to be good for materials processing
since it is very difficult to focus the N2 laser beam to a small spot.
However, it can be used to pump a dye laser and for all sorts of other
applications requiring intense UV (and safety precautions must be taken to
guard against excessive UV exposure).
<p>
However, despite the apparent simplicity of the N2 laser, don't be tempted to
improvise before you get the SciAm design to lase.  Even this simple laser
can't just be thrown together (despite what you might think from the humor in
the section: <A HREF="lasercn2.htm#cn2cnlh2">Nitrogen Laser Construction on a
Shoestring</A> - this should not be taken seriously).  Start out with the same
dimensions, materials, and construction techniques, and success is almost
certain.  While the SciAm N2 laser is not necessarily optimal or the highest
power possible, it does work.  Bigger is not necessarily better (or higher
power but may actually be 0.00 power.  You can't just increase the size of
the capacitors and laser tube and expect it to do anything useful).  Once your
N2 laser is operational, feel free to go hog wild experementing.  But even
then, change only one thing at a time!
<p>
In case you are wondering, N2 lasers do have their uses besides being a good
first laser for the home-built laser enthusiast.  These include: optical
pumping of dye lasers, UV spectroscopy, non-destructive testing, fluorescence
measurements of materials, and measurements of very fast processes (nanosecond
UV strobe for high speed photography).  Perhaps, these are not as glamorous as
laser light shows and laser welding, but important applications nonetheless!
<p>
(From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
<p>
The molecular nitrogen laser was discovered by H. G. Heard, who
published an article about it in Nature in 1963. The first nitrogen
lasers produced only a few watts, but people soon began to optimize
them, and maximum power of at least 5 MW is possible in a realistic
discharge-pumped device, with maximum pulse energies of about 20
mJ. Higher powers have been reported in discharge-pumped nitrogen
lasers, but have not been reproduced. Electron-beam pumping is also
possible. Nitrogen emits primarily at 337.1 nm, but is also reported
to put out a small proportion of its energy at 357.6 nm, and there is
a peak in the IR, which can apparently comprise as much as 20% of the
output under some conditions. Although nitrogen lasers have been
operated over a range of partial pressures from a few Torr to more
than 1 atmosphere, it is common to divide them into two categories:
low pressure and atmospheric pressure. (Atmospheric pressure nitrogen
lasers are almost always excited transversely, and fall into the
general category o f lasers.) The upper-state lifetime of nitrogen is
inversely related to pressure; it is approximately 40 nsec at
pressures of a few Torr, decreasing to perhaps 2 nsec at 1
atmosphere. Unfortunately, the lower laser level has much longer
lifetime; this cause s, and the laser is self-terminating. This effect
seriously limits both the duration of the pulse and the efficiency of
the laser. Nitrogen is pumped by direct electron impact, typically in
a pulsed electrical discharge; if the electrons do not have sufficietn
long before they run out of headroom. Low-pressure nitrogen lasers
typically emit pulses that are either 4-8 nsec long (most small
devices and a few high-performance devices) or 10-20 nsec long (some
high-performance devices). Atmospheric pressure nitrogen lasers emit
pulses that are typically 600-800 psec long. Helium is a useful
diluent, at least at low partial pressures; a 50-50 mixture of
nitrogen and helium is reported to produce smoother and more reliable
operation in low-pressure lasers, and some low-pressure lasers can
even run when filled with 1 atmosphere of helium, to which is added a
small partial pressure of nitrogen. Addition of electron-attaching
gases, including SF6 and NF3, has also been reported to improve the
operation, but these are not suitable for DIY use. NF3, in particular,
is quite dangerous.
<p>
There is also a nitrogen <i>ion</i> laser, which runs in a very dilute He-N2
mixture. At least 4 lines have been reported with electron-beam
pumping, some in the UV and some in the visible. With discharge
pumping, the most prominent line typically seems to be at 428 nm.

<h3><A NAME="cn2saf">Home-Built N2 Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are three areas of safety considerations for the home-built N2 laser (and
other similar lasers, for that matter):
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built N2 laser operates at 337.1 nm producing
 pulses of ultra-violet radiation in the UVA region of the electromagnetic
 spectrum.  While its peak output may be 100 kW or more, the pulse duration is
 only a few nanoseconds at most.  The pulse repetition rate (for the SciAm
 design, at least) may be anywhere from one pulse every few seconds (using the
 DC powered HV inverter) to several (maybe as much as 120) per second (using a
 neon sign transformer based power supply).  A 5 ns 100 kW pulse has an energy
 of .5 mJ which may not sound like a lot but is still a potential hazard.  At
 a pulse rate of 120 pps, the average power is 60 mW which IS a significant
 amount of UV light.  Since the N2 laser doesn't produce a particularly well
 collimated beam, it won't focus to a very small intense spot.  Thus, I doubt
 that it will be possible to use this laser to burn things. :(
<p>
 For eye protection, low cost plastic (e.g., polycarbonate) safety glasses
 or wrap-around UV blocking Sun glasses should stop most UV but since these
 vary widely, it is essential to test your sample at the 337.1 nm N2 laser
 wavelength.  Some goggles spec'd for CO2 lasers also have a UV-blocking
 range which includes 337.1 nm with adequate optical density.  These tend
 to be much less expensive than other (perhaps $50) but may indeed just be
 the same as Home Depot $2 safety glasses based on their overall transmission
 of over 90 percent.  Proper UV laser safety glasses (probably labeled
 something along the lines of N2/Excimer) would also, of course, be
 satisfactory but are expensive.  A pair of Welder's goggles or a helmet
 should also block UV but are probably a bit unwieldy.
<p>
 As with any laser in its power class, take precautions to avoid exposure to
 the direct or reflected beam.  There are easier and safer ways of getting a
 tan (to the extent that any E/M radiation induced tan is safe).
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supplies can be lethal.  While the suggested
 DC powered HV inverter is capable of only a few mA - if that - at 20 kV, the
 capacitors can store enough charge to stop a weak heart or startle you into
 doing something you might regret.  Make sure you read and follow the
 <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered
 Equipment</A>.  Insulate all connections and install barriers to prevent
 contact with the high voltage.
<p>
<li><b>Spark Gap:</b> The discharge trigger for the capacitor pulse circuit of
 the N2 laser is an air spark gap.  This produces both non-trivial amounts of
 broadband UV (similar to an electric welder) as well as NOISE.  Therefore,
 it is a good idea to enclose the spark gap to minimize their escape.
</ul>
<p>
Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.
<p>
For more information, see the chapter: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser
Safety</A>.  Sample safety labels which can be edited for this laser can be
found in the section: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saflslbl">Laser Safety Labels

 include the higher pulse rate neon sign transformer based power supply
 instead of the low power inverter to generate the high voltage for charging
 the N2 laser capacitors.)  However, the somewhat more detailed instructions
 in these plans (compared to the SciAm article) and the availability of the
 electronic parts (from Information Unlimited) may make them beneficial
 to someone who isn't enthusiastic about scrounging, designing, or
 improvising, and would rather take more of a cookbook approach to home-built

Many variations are possible and easy to try since very little is really
critical.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="n21asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Nitrogen Laser Assembly</A>
for a simplified diagram of the overall structure and low voltage operated
inverter type power supply electronics.  Also,
<p>
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall - L.
  <li>Glass work - None required.
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work) - L.
  <li>Vacuum/gas handling - L.
  <li>Power supply - L.
  <li>Additional apparatus - None.
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - 337.1 nm (near UV).  This is in the UVA range of
  suntanning wavelengths.
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium - Low pressure nitrogen gas.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter - 5 cm x 5 cm (2 inch x 2 inch) box; bore length - 30 cm
    (1 foot).
<p>
  <li>Total tube length - Same.
<p>
  <li>Tube material - Plexiglas.
<p>
  <li>Electrodes - Copper foil, 1 cm gap lengthwise along entire tube.  Any
   metal can be used including copper, aluminum, steel, and stainless steel,
   but it is essential to assure a good low impedance connection to them from
   the capacitor plates.  Thus, being able to solder directly to copper is a
   definite advantage.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill - Nitrogen (welder's quality recommended) at about 100 Torr.
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Glass microscope slides at 20 to 30 degree angle (not Brewster
    windows) to minimize reflections back into the laser cavity.  Note: The
    material used must have high optical quality and be fairly transparent to
    the 337.1 nm UV wavelength.  Microscope slides are decent quality and thin
    enough not to absorb too much UV (just over 5 percent for a 1 mm thick
    slide).  A higher cost alternative would be a flat quartz plate which will
    absorb even less UV (less than 1 percent for 1 mm thickness).  DO NOT use
    ordinary window glass (low quality and absorbs too much UV) or plastic
    (totally opaque to UV).  (From the Melles Griot 1997-98 Optics catalog:
    Approximate transmission at 337 nm for 1 cm thick Crown glass (probably
    similar to microscope slide glass): 55 percent; fused quartz: 93 percent.
    For 1 mm thickness, the transmission will be the 10th root of these
    values.)
<p>
  <li>Mirrors - None required!  However, a single mirror can be installed at
    one end as the HR to double output.
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length - NA.

<p>
<li>Vacuum system:

    should be fine.

  <li>Sealed while operating.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required - None.
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - Blumlein high current electrical discharge.  See <A HREF=
  "http://members.aol.com/dlames2/N2_Project/N2_animation.html">Daniel Ames'
   N2 Laser Animation Page</A> for a cute sequence of GIFs (no Java!) showing
   how the Blumlein circuit operates.
<p>
  <li>Power supply - 20,000 VDC, low current.  A transistor inverter and
   voltage multiplier or a neon sign transformer based supply can be used.
   Either of the flyback based high voltage circuits in the document:
   <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/samschem.htm">Various
   Schematics and Diagrams</A> can be used to power the home-built N2 laser
   as well.  In all cases, take care that the voltage does not rise too high
   and puncture the Blumlein capacitors/PCB material!
</ul>
<p>
The Blumlein circuit is approximately equivalent to the following:

<p>
The HV power supply charges both capacitors to nearly 20 kV.  When the spark
gap breaks down, C2 is shorted out and the full voltage on C1 appears across
the gap along the length of the laser cavity very quickly causing the nitrogen
gas to ionize.  (Actually, the voltage pulse hits the center of the cavity
first and spreads to the ends in a couple of nanoseconds!)  R1 simply isolates
and limits current from the HV power supply - its value is irrelevant when the
spark gap triggers!
<p>
Note: The drawings in "Light and its Uses" are at the very least confusing and
may be wrong in some aspects of the description of operation of the Blumlein
effect.

<h3><A NAME="cn2guide">Guidelines to Assure a Successful Home-Built N2
 Laser</A></h3>

These set of guidelines should be followed during construction of your first
home-built N2 laser.  The factors below will greatly influence the
ultimate output power, beam quality, and whether it produces any coherent
light at all!  Once you have a working laser, feel free to make
modifications - one at a time.
<p>
For your first N2 laser, don't change any of the dimensions or materials of
the main laser assembly including the channel and Blumlein capacitor.  The
N2 laser is the easiest one to build successfully if you don't change
anything critical!  In particular:

<ul>
<li>Build the Blumlein capacitors exactly as described in the SciAm article
 using the same Fiberglas Epoxy PCB or other material with at least the same
 voltage rating and dielectric constant.  <b>Don't</b> attempt to use other
 types of caps including rolled up or multilayer aluminum foil and Saran wrap,
 thicker PCB stock (which will reduce capacitance), photoflash caps, computer
 grade electrolytics, or 1,000 ceramic bypass caps.  While some of these (like
 rolled up caps) <i>may</i> work, most will have too much inductance and
 result in a pulse that is too slow.  Your laser won't work well or more
 likely, at all!
<p>
<li>Use welding purity or better nitrogen gas at low pressure - don't attempt
 to use plain air until you have a working laser and don't try operation at
 1 atmosphere until then either.
<p>
<li>Make sure you read, understand, and follow <b>ALL</b> the safety
 guidelines found in the section: <A HREF="lasercn2.htm#cn2saf">Home-Built
 N2 Laser Safety</A>.

<h2>Other Examples of Home-Built N2 Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cn2bg1">Bruno Godard's N2 Laser</A></h3>

Well, this one probably wasn't actually built at a home but close enough. :)
<p>
The following is from a paper by Bruno Godard entitled: "A Very Simple High
Power Large Efficiency N2 Laser", May 1973.  The copy I have is from the
"Laboratoires De Marcoussis, Centre De Recherches De La 
Compagnie Generale d'Electricit, Departement Recherches Physiques
de Base, Section Sources d'Ondes Cohrentes", 91460 - Marcoussis France.
Thanks to Jon Singer
(<A HREF="mailto:jon@joss.com">jon@joss.com</A>) for locating this
paper.  The author claims a peak power of almost 10 <b>MegaWatts</b> with 1
percent efficiency under certain conditions.  This should be substantially
the same as his paper "A Simple High-Power Large-Efficiency N2 Ultraviolet
Laser", published in the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. QE-10,
pg. 147, 1974.
<p>
Note that I don't know of anyone duplicating these results.
<p>
Notable physical features of this design include:
<p>
<ol>
<li>A parabolic shape for the primary capacitor electrode (the one with the
 spark gap) to create a linear excitation of the laser channel that moves
 with the speed of light.
<p>
<li>A longer cavity than that of the SciAm laser (almost double).
<p>
<li>A suggestion to use a dual electrode configuration for higher power
 (split the bottom plate of the capacitor as well as the top one).
 <p>
 (From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
 <p>
 <blockquote>
 "I have seen at least one other design in which they ran the 
 'electrodes-on-bottom-as-well-as-on-top' thing, and got more power.
  Can't remember what the other consequences were, if any."
 </blockquote>
</ol>
<p>
The most significant by far is (1).  Due to the fact that the upper state
lifetime (e.g., fluorescence lifetime) of N2 is about 40 ns and much shorter
than that of the levels below (5 to 8 us) which provide the relevant laser
transitions, a very short excitation pulse is needed to create a population
inversion - shorter than that 40 ns duration.  The SciAm laser attempts to
meet this condition using the so-called "Blumlein" circuit which (according
to that description) results in a cylindrical wavefront which intersects the
lasing channel head-on.  Whether we believe that this actually works as
advertised (at least the laser <b>does</b> lase but see the section:
<A HREF="lasercn2.htm#cn2cn27">Jon's Comments on the SciAm N2 Laser</A> for
reasons why it may not be a true Blumlein circuit), even this cylindrical
wavefront can readily be seen to be less than optimal: The center hits first
and then the wavefront travels toward the ends.
<p>
What would be better would be excitation that travels down the channel at
the speed of light so that the population inversion essentially follows or
tracks the light pulse as it is formed (recall that the N2 laser is essentially
a superfluorescence device - the gain is so high that you don't need mirrors.
So, there is only one pass of stimulated emission with at most a single
reflection (optional) of the light going in the opposite direction from a
HR mirror).
<p>
The parabolic shape of the primary capacitor is supposed to deal with this
deficiency.  It is well known that a if a point source is placed at a location
called the 'focus' of a parabola, its rays will be redirected into a parallel
beam by reflection.  The most important characteristic of a parabola relevant
for this N2 laser is:

<ul> 
<li>A ray in any direction taken from the parabola's focus and reflected
 off the parabola will traverse a constant distance to a line drawn
 perpendicular to the parabola's axis of symmetry and will intersect it in a
 perpendicular direction.
</ul>

One can see that this is the case based on the old trick of generating an
ellipse using a string fixed at two points (the two foci) with a pin or
nail holding it taught to trace the shape.  A parabola is just the limit of
an ellipse with one of the two foci at infinity.
<p>
If we tilt that line so it isn't perpendicular, rather than all rays hitting
it simultaneously, they will sweep from one end to the other with a constant
velocity.  If the angle is adjusted to be equal to: cos<sup>-1</sup>(c/V),
(where c is the velocity of light and V is the velocity of an E/M wave in the
capacitor plane), the wavefront should hit and travel along the lasing
channel at a speed of c.
<p>
See <A HREF="godard1.gif">N2 Laser with Parabolic Pulse Forming Capacitor</A>
for a diagram of the overall arrangement.  With the dual electrode
configuration, top and bottom are nearly symmetric with the PCB passing
through the center (vertically) of the channel thus requiring no copper foil
for the connections (which add inductance) as with the SciAm and other
N2 lasers (see <A HREF="n21asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Nitrogen Laser
Assembly</A>).
<p>
To prevent the direct wave from the capacitor discharge from hitting the
channel (which would be too early), an additional little reflector is placed
adjacent to the spark gap on the side nearest the channel.
<p>
Aside from the parabolic capacitor and size, the authors also suggest
splitting the lower electrode across the channel to generate twice the
discharge current density and thus greater power - but mention that this
is less reliable (probably due to the higher voltage requirements to cross
two gaps).
<p>
The overall arrangement is similar to <A HREF="n21asm.gif">Typical
Home-Built Nitrogen Laser Assembly</A> but with the changes described.
See <A HREF="godard1.gif">N2 Laser with Parabolic Pulse Forming Capacitor</A>
for a plane (overhead) view of the laser.  Note that few dimensions are
provided in the paper so much of the following is estimated.
<p>
Note, however, that this scheme (assuming it really works nearly as well as
claimed - which isn't obvious!) doesn't result in a uniform intensity of the
wavefront, only a constant velocity.  That is for the advanced course. :)  In
principle, a piece-wise synthesis of the parabolic shape may be able to
improve this uniformity - perhaps this has been done by someone.
<p>
There is a paper by Shipman which describes a system which used a set of solid
dielectric switches, triggered in sequence, to sorta add up little pieces of
circle to effectively make a wobbly but generally straight line. That
apparently worked - but he didn't try to bounce it off anything.
<p>
Godard has at least one other article that appears to be based on either the
same laser or another very similar one: Bruno Godard and Maurice Vannier,
"Compact Efficient Discharge Lasers in XeF, KrF, and Fluorine", Optics
Communications, v18n2, July 1976, pp. 206-207.  Unfortunately the article,
which is short, doesn't have a drawing of the physical device.

The HV power supply charges both capacitors to the spark gap breakdown
voltage.  When the spark gap fires, C2 is shorted out and the full voltage on
C1 appears across the both gaps along the length of the laser cavity
very quickly causing the nitrogen gas to ionize.  With the parabolic reflector,
the wavefront hits at the closer end of the channel first and travels down
the channel at the speed of light - so they say. :)  As with the SciAm
N2 laser, R1, L1, and L2 are only used for charging; they are for all intents
and purposes, open circuits when the laser fires.

<h3><A NAME="cn2dg1">David Grace's Air Lasers</A></h3>

(From: David Grace (david_the_sparky@hotmail.com).)
<p>
I built an air laser operating at 1 atm.
<p>
The design itself is the same as the common Blumlein type. The two top
plates of the capacitor consist of 1.5 mm thick aluminum plates of
dimensions of 20 cm (L) x 9 cm (W).  The capacitance of this setup is
2.5 nF. Between these two plates is an inductor or coil of wire.  The
inductor I use has 12 turns of 1 mm thick copper wire. The number of turns
does not matter - the performance of the laser is identical with a 1
turn inductor, and also a 50 turn inductor.
<p>
The dielectric of the laser is a polyethylene sheet of 75 microns thick. The
base plate of the capacitor is the same thickness aluminum as the top
plates. The laser switch spark gap is set to about 2 mm, so although my power
supply is 10,000 VDC, only 2 to 4 KVDC is across the capacitor, so there is no
chance of the thin dielectric failing.  The bottom plate is connected to the
+ve part of the neon transformer.
<p>
The laser air cavity is formed between the two top plates, and is fully
exposed to air. No closed cavity or vacuum pumps here. Also no pure N2 is
used - just air. The gap between the laser electrodes is very small - about
1.5 mm, so any beam produced is only 1.5 mm wide.  The length of the laser
cavity is 20 cm as determined by the dimensions of the upper plates. To make
this work I obtained two long 'L' shaped rails of aluminum from the hardware
store.  These are placed so that they sit on the upper cap plates.  Their
facing edges form the gap.
<p>
When switched on, sparks as well as corona are seen along the gap between
the L shaped electrodes. Aligning these electrodes so an even sparking is
made along the gap is needed to make the the laser work.  Corona alone will
not make this work!! I have found that you must have those bad sparks along
the gap to make this lase.
<p>
The laser produces an interesting pattern on paper. Ring and stripe
structures can be clearly seen in the main body of the beam. In the next few
days I will be scaling this up to 60 cm long to see if it still works with
higher inductance. Also it will be interesting to see if the higher
capacitance and longer length of the laser will boost performance.
<p>
In summary, it is easy to construct an N2 laser in air with no vacuum system.
While maybe not nearly as powerful as a properly designed vacuum n2 laser, it
is still a good project to make.
<p>
(A few months later)
<p>
I finally got round to building the larger version of my air laser.  It is the
same design as the first one (still 1 atm pressure with air as laser gas), but
the channel is now 70 cm in length. The whole capacitor setup is built around
the size of this channel.  The size of the actual setup is 70 cm x 45 cm with
each upper capacitor plate being 20 cm x 70 cm. The capacitance of the blumlein
switch capacitor is also larger, being about the 12 nF mark. A 12 turn
inductor is still used between  the upper capacitor plates.
<p>
The results were as expected: The beam is much less divergent as it spreads
from 4 mm wide from the laser to about 10cm at a 5 m distance. The first laser
of this type spread twice this at the same distance, so there is an
improvement there with this new large one.  The beam is about 3 to 5 times
intense (estimated), so dyes may be a possible option for this N2 laser.
<p>
This has been a most amazing project to build. It is certainly a very
easy laser to build as no vacuum pumps or gases are needed. It performs very 
well for its simplicity in this manner. I don't know how it compares to 
proper N2 vacuum job lasers, but if I can pump dye lasers with this then the 
power it puts out must be comparable to those properly designed N2 lasers.

<h3><A NAME="cn2rm1">Robert Meagley's N2 Lasers</A></h3>

(From: R. Meagley (rmeagley@gte.net).)
<p>
In the past 4 months I have successfully built 3 N2 lasers 1/2, 2/3, and
1 meter in length with 0.5 cm gap and 8 kV power supply, 1 square meter caps. 
<p>
I have tested both rolled and flat capacitor designs. Rolled <i>does</i> work.
Thin dielectric is absolutely critical. Zap, zap, zap - very impressive
output! 10 to 20 Hz repetition rate, spark gap trigger. Jitter is limited by
air gap.  These lasers also work with air in place of pure N2.

<h3><A NAME="cn2dr1">Don Raphaelus's N2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Don Raphaelus (donraphaelus@hotmail.com).)
<p>
A few months ago, I didn't know anything about lasers, but in a matter
of a couple months, I have opened my eyes to the coherent light - with
safety glasses of course! :)  Now I'm what you may call a "laser nut",
looking in supermarkets for old bar code scanners, even building a N2 laser!
I was amazed when it lased in a cold Saturday night! Tears rolled on my
face - after all, I built it by myself! A coherent UV front!  Ok, the
output wasn't so great, but still was amazing! First I tried to build the PCB
caps but that was so $$$. Then I tried garbage bags with aluminum foil. The
lasing gas was welders N2, and a salvaged refrigerator pump. No manometers
to control the pressure, just two valves. The spark gap was two nails,
spaced 1 cm apart. And the the head was traditional (L-aluminum from
a hardware store and a box made of acrylic). it worked for ten minutes
completely sealed, then died. There are several small leaks, but I just
have to flush and fill it again, and go on. Oh, and the HR mirror was a
first surface automobile mirror!

<h3><A NAME="cn2hal">Hubert Pissavin's $10 Air Laser</A></h3>

Here's one you can literally build for $10 (excluding the high voltage
power supply).  No vacuum pump, no special gases, just common household
materials: See: <A HREF="http://spt06.chez.tiscali.fr/00/air.htm">Hubert's
Laser Page: Air Laser</A>.

<h3><A NAME="cn2bg1">Bernhard Gruber's N2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: "Bernhard Gruber" (unix@utanet.at).)
<p>
Some years ago I built an N2 laser.
<p>
I used two 50 cm long Plexiglas rods (width: 4 cm, 1 cm thick) with a 1 cm
wide 5 mm deep milled channel along the middle.  This also had a gas inlet
and outlet. The gas was pure N2 at 70 to 200 Torr.  Two brass electrodes,
former used as blades in the paper production - were glued with silicone
sealer between the rods. I carefully rounded off the inner edges to prevent
corona effect (also important for aluminum foil).  They are adjustable (a
little bit) by using some kind of clamp or something similar.  I glued a
microscope slide at about a 10 degree angle with Epoxy.
<p>
The capacitors were made of aluminum foil and thin PE plastic which normally
is used for packaging.  Beware of enough isolation between the bottom and top
plates - depending on the voltage you use - I had 2 cm more plastic on each
edge at 8 kVDC.  The inductor was not that critical - 10 turns of 1 mm copper
ire, diameter about 2 cm with 2 to 3 mm space between the turns (also a long
enough straight wire will work).
<p>
The spark-gap was a home-built encapsulated one.  Encapsulation is necessary,
due to the high noise level -> if you working around with your laser and the
flashes and noise of the spark-gap illuminates the lab window, your neighbor's
will be amazed about and starts whispering.  (If further during the copper
vapor laser development, the 6 kW Marx generator interferes with their TV and
satellite receivers - but thats another story.)
<p>
The power supply was a 6 kV/20 mA neon sign transformer.  The more power
(current) you have, the higher the repetition rate is for the same assembly.
therefore it doesn't make sense to use high power charging for this kind of
laser.  To increase the energy density, increase the gap between the main
electrodes and use higher voltages, or increase the length of the laser
chamber, but always beware of a lowest inductive design something like
RF-design (also there you need the 'magic finger') after everything works
fine place a simple mirror on one preferred side - this is the backside.
If your design works well and you haven't too much gap between the main
electrodes, you can try running this goodie at atmospheric
condition (TEA laser) without pure N2 gas (but this will reduce the
efficiency).
<p>
Adjust the main electrodes until a fast discharge appears between them equally.
<p>
Test your laser on a white paper (recycled one has no optical brightener
coating on it) or better use an organic dye fluorescein, rhodamine, dissolved
in methanol or ethanol - if you work on Sunday also isopropyl is allowed. :-)
For rhodamine, water can be used instead.  Or if nothing no real dye
is available just borrow your son's text marker and wash the ingredients
into your 'dye cell'.

<h3><A NAME="cn2ab1">Andrew Baker's $4 N2 Laser</A></h3>

Well, not counting the vacuum pump. :)
<p>
(From: Andrew Baker.)
<p>
I did a super simple one back a year or two ago.
<p>
The lasing chamber used took two 3/4" x 1/8" aluminum bars (hardware store)
about 10" long and two strips of thin Plexiglas, maybe 1" wide, same length
as the aluminum.  I buffed the edges of the aluminum smooth and then
warmed up the aluminum strips with a heat shrink gun, and positioned them
about 3/16" apart.  I then used a hot-glue gun to apply a bead along the
aluminum strips.  Preheat is a good idea, otherwise the hot-melt glue doesn't
bond well. Lay the strip of plexiglas in the glue, press and wait.  Flip the
entire thing and repeat with the second piece of Plexiglas. Now you have a
little channel that's 1/8" x 3/16".
<p>
End View:

             ===========
              Plexiglas

</PRE>
<p>
Drill holes. hot glue hose barbs for the vacuum line.  It will probably
leak enough that you don't need to do an inlet if you're using plain air.
<p>
Go crazy with copious amounts of hot glue when you put the microscope slides
on. They probably won't hold well, but that's what the vacuum is for. :-)
<p>
The capacitors were aluminum foil with thick Mylar in between,  Each piece was
around 10" x 10". Simply set the "laser tube" on top of the capacitor so it
lines up with the edges of the two top capacitors.  Use something heavy on
top of it to hold it tight to the foil. Styrofoam with a brick on top. Hold
the inductor on the same way.
<p>
The spark gap was two large ball bearings sitting on top of nuts at the edge of
the capacitor plates. The bottom foil extends out beyond the dielectric. One
is there, the other is on top. Just move them (DISCHARGE FIRST!!!) to change
spark gap.  Put a plastic bowl over the "spark gap"
<p>
The power supply was for a HeNe laser. The trigger circuit gave enough juice to
charge the caps up to maybe 10 kV. It produced a beam right off the bat -
discharge once a second, made a beam about every other discharge.
<p>
Cost was about $4 and it took 45 minutes to make.  However, the capacitors
made an awesome sizzling noise.  Dielectric breakdown was a problem, mostly
because it was hard to get all the air bubbles out from between the layers,
so there was some corona heating.

<h3><A NAME="cn2js1">Jon Singer's Low Cost Pseudo-TEA N2 Laser</A></h3>

While this laser operates at 1 atm, it uses a mixture of N2 and He
with a partial pressure of N2 around 30 to 50 Torr to allow the discharge
to take place at a reasonable voltage.  The pulse width is also much longer
than the 1 ns typical of a true TEA laser.  Thus the "pseudo" in the name. :)

I'm working on learning about high-performance nitrogen
lasers, and in the process I am building some machines. I
don't have high performance yet (working on it), but I do
have a laser design that seems reasonably cheap and easy,
all things considered.  I haven't actually pushed it to its
limits, but I seriously doubt that it puts out more than
perhaps 50 to 100 kW in its current configuration, but it's
basically a learning a learning machine, and I'm fairly
pleased with it.

you ever expect (or want) to see on a scope!  I think at least some of it is
the fact that the entire driver circuit (probably including the head, which
is 4 feet long) is acting as a nice big antenna for the immense EMP that the
thing generates. I expect to put up some sort of barrier soon, to see
if I can reduce the radiated crap. (The main storage cap is 89 nf, and
I'm charging it to 35 kV. That's 50 J per pulse, and I'm dissipating
it fairly swiftly in the "antenna"...)

loosely as "more than 250 kW peak pulse power", though if you really
want to be stringent and finicky about it, you could arbitrarily put
the lower bound at 500 kW and describe the region between 100 kW and
500 kW as "mid- performance".
<p>
I do hope to get 500 kW out of this monster when it is
optimized.
<p>
This driver would certainly come under "Unusual Technologies and Techniques".
Not many people have bothered to build water-cap driver circuits (I've
never actually heard of a DIY one), despite the fact that the
dielectric is self-healing if punctured, has dielectric constant of
about 80, and has dielectric strength of about 1 GV/meter (!). This is
probably because there are significant downsides.
<p>
On the other hand, 2 or 3 of the hottest nitrogen lasers ever published (and
possibly also one that was not published -- I have word of mouth from
a former professional designer about a high-performance TEA laser that
he made) used water-caps, and it is clear that they (water-caps) are
within the reach of DIY folks who are willing to learn to deal. The
stainless steel trays cost me all of $17.20 each, the walls are wood
(though I will admit that I would not do it that way again -- next
time, I want to be able to see inside the cap), and I got the
water-purifying resin on eBay. I am obliged to admit that this is
tweak city, but it is not rocket science.

<p>
I have built a transverse electrode nitrogen gas laser that operates at
atmospheric pressure. It uses pure nitrogen gas from a bottled gas
supply. This is the smallest laser of this type I have successfully
made. The active region is only 5 inches (12.7 cm) long. This was
possible because I used a new electrode configuration I discovered
through trial and error. One electrode is round (a rod shaped
profile), and the other is the more traditional L-profile (straight
edge) shaped electrode. This electrode arrangement greatly improves
performance, and enables a shorter active region than I have otherwise
been able to use.

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn24">Construction of the Capacitors for the N2 Laser Blumlein
 Pulse Circuit</A></h3>

In order to achieve the super fast discharge pulse required for the N2 laser,
a planar capacitor almost certainly must be used.  This means that rolled up
beer can style caps or computer grade electrolytics won't work!  The
traditional material for these caps has been .015" thick Fiberglas-Epoxy
printed circuit board (PCB) stock, copper plated on both sides and with
selected areas removed around the edges and for the main channel.  This is
what's described below.  This is the main hard-to-find part for the N2 laser.
I don't have a guaranteed source for this stuff but it may be available from
printed circuit board suppliers.  With all the on-line PCB sources nowadays,
it might be possible to obtain via that route?  Has anyone checked recently?
<p>
However, an alternative with some distinct advantages in terms of breakdown
voltage and availability (marginal and hard to find, respectively) may be to
use polyethylene for the dielectric and aluminum flashing for the plates.
<p>
Here's the traditional approach:
<p>
The capacitors are formed between the top and bottom copper foil on 30 x 45 x
0.04 cm (12" x 18" x 0.015") Fiberglass-Epoxy printed circuit board material.
The top and bottom are etched for 2 cm around the edges and a 5 cm strip down
the middle on top is removed to separate the plates for the two capacitors.
<p>
The basic parallel plate capacitor formula is:
<PRE>
                      A * K * 8.85 pF/m
                 C = ------------------- * (N - 1)
                              d
</PRE>
Where:
<ul>
  <li>C is the resulting capacitance in pF.
  <li>A is area of the plates in square meters.
  <li>K is the dielectric constant.
  <li>8.85 pF/m is the permittivity of a vacuum.
  <li>d is plate separation in meters.
  <li>N is the number of plates.
</ul>

Or, if you insist on non-Metric units where possible (A and d are in square
inches and inches respectively), the capacitance in picofarads is equal to:
<PRE>
                        .224 * A * K
                   C = -------------- * (N - 1)
                             d
</PRE>
The total capacitance of the SciAm N2 laser totals about .012 uF.  Note that
due to the thickness (or lack thereof) of the PCB material and its high
dielectric constant, this is several times greater than the capacitance of a
large CRT!
<p>
You won't find the PCB material at Radio Shack but it should be available at
reasonable cost from surplus electronics dealers or PCB fabrication houses.
However, tracking down one in your neighborhood may take some finger or leg
work.  Here are a couple of sources found in the Portland, OR, area, for
example:
<p>
(From: Scott & Pat Chewning (patch@europa.com).)
<ul>
<li>Cascade Electronic Surplus, Portland, OR, 1-503-285-0832.  Open Thursday
 to Saturday!  They will cut to your needs, up to 6' x 45' (that's feet!), all
 .015" thick and have almost any other size.
<p>
<li>R5-D3, Portland, OR, 1-503-774-6560.  Open Wednesday to Saturday.  Good if
 you want anything hard to find, especially vacuum tubes.  He has 3' x 4'
 sheets for $10.
</ul>
Once you have obtained the PCB material, it needs to be cut to size.  This can
be done with a band saw and fine tooth blade, a power shear, hack saw, nibbling
tool, or even a pair of metal snips or paper cutter!  (Though the fiberglass
is hard on blades, cutting a couple sheets of this stuff shouldn't affect
anything.)  Then, the copper needs to be removed from selected areas to form
the plates of the two capacitors of the Blumlein circuit:
<ul>
<li>The best way to remove the unwanted copper is probably with PCB etching
 solution (cupric chloride and hydrochloric acid, ferric chloride, or dilute
 nitric acid).  Areas to be preserved are masked off with plastic tape, PCB
 resist, or another material impervious to the etching solution.  Radio Shack
 is supposed to have a kit for about $14 which comes with resist ink, resist
 solvent, and ferric chloride etching solution.  Other large electronics
 distributors will have similar kits as well (and probably cheaper)  All you
 really need is the etching solution and some sort of masking material or
 resist - these may be available as refill items.
<p>
 WARNING: Handle and dispose of used etching chemicals responsibly - depending
 on type, they may stain or eat pipes (copper drain lines!!!), masonry and
 other building and landscaping materials, as well as human flesh.  Read and
 follow all package instructions.
<p>
<li>With care, it may be possible to do this mechanically without the use of
 messy chemicals.  However, it is absolutely critical to avoid damage to the
 underlying Fiberglass Epoxy or else there will be areas of reduced dielectric
 strength and it will arc through the first time HV is applied.  The chemical
 etch approach above is inherently harmless to the board material itself.
<p>
 For the Blumlein capacitors as specified for the N2 laser, proceed as follows:
 Taking care not to penetrate the copper, use a sharpened nail or awl to
 scribe lines on the *surface* 2 cm from all 4 edges top and bottom, and
 another pair of lines front to back across the board 5 cm apart on the top
 only for the gap between the two plates.  Then, use an Xacto knife or razor
 blade to lift the copper from the from the board at a corner or edge.  The
 copper can be peeled from the board to back to these lines and then flexed
 back and forth to break the copper.  I don't know what, if any, latent
 surface damage may result from this approach.  Therefore, the chemical etch
 is preferred if you can stand the mess!
</ul>

Note that the approximate puncture voltage for this material is 1 kV/mil (.001
inch or .025 mm) (though it may be lower, see below).  Therefore, the .04 cm
specified in "Light and its Uses" is good for about 16 kV which is probably a
bit marginal.  Going to 20 kV will probably not cause problems but I wouldn't
recommend pushing your luck much beyond this.
<p>
Other materials like Plexiglas can be used but there will always be tradeoffs:
<p>
The puncture voltage for acrylic plastic (Plexiglas) varies between 450 and
990 volts per mil (.001") depending upon the quality of the product.  Common
1/8" (.3 cm) thick sheet (assuming the lower value for puncture voltage) should
be able to withstand over 55,000 volts; 1/16" sheet (.015 cm) will handle
over 25 kV which is still adequate.  The problem that you will encounter is
the low capacitance obtained with the same surface area of even the thinner
Plexiglas material (compared to the .015" (.04 cm) Fiberglass-Epoxy (though
as noted above, that thickness may not be quite enough to withstand 20 kV).
The dielectric constant for Plexiglas is also lower and with the increased
thickness results in much less total capacitance.  Stacking additional layers
may not be a viable option due to the nanosecond timing requirements!
<p>
What about using discrete capacitors?  You are, of course, welcome to
experiment.  However, I might suggest that starting with something that is
known to work would be prudent even if it takes a little longer to find the
proper materials.  Homemade capacitors made from 10 or 100 or whatever of
1 or 2 kV units in series-parallel is asking for trouble especially in a rapid
discharge circuit like this.  The inductance of the leads alone will probably
greatly slow the rate of discharge.  Any inequality in capacitance and even
how they are connected will result in voltage differences across the
capacitors so they may fail immediately if not sooner.  Even commercial high
voltage capacitors may be inadequate.  And, distributing enough of either type
of discrete capacitor in just the right locations to simulate the discharge
wave of the Blumlein device could prove quite a challenge in its own right!
<p>
(From (From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
No, it doesn't seem possible that .015" PCB material, can withstand 20,000
volts. Because it won't, at least not for very long. It is not necessarily the
arcing around the sides that present a problem but it's the "puncture voltage
rating" that must be considered.  Epoxy circuit board has an estimated
puncture voltage of 700 volts per mil (.001"). A 0.014" thick capacitor made
from this material would only be safely rated for 9800 volts. I speak from
experience, as I have been using a 0.015" thick PCB capacitor with
around 15,000 volts and have blown holes through the dielectric a number of
times. With this thickness I would suggest that you limit your applied voltage
to about 10,000 volts to prevent permanent damage to the capacitor's
dielectric.
<p>
Increasing the thickness of the PCB material would certainly allow more
voltage to safely be applied without damage to the dielectric, but there are
drawbacks to this 'solution' when incorporating such a capacitor into an N2
laser design. The first and most obvious problem is a decrease in capacitance
when a thicker dielectric separates the charged plates while using the same
dimensional area. This would lead to less stored energy that could be to be
delivered to the laser channel.
<p>
Another more profound and less well known effect would be the increase of
self-inductance caused by the thicker board. This increase may be great enough
to lengthen the discharge time far beyond what may be allowed for an N2 laser
to function.
<p>
In any case, to start, I'd strongly suggest that you try and locate the
printed circuit board material as specified in the SciAm article.  This must
be at least 18" x 12" and have the 0.015" thickness.  The length of the laser
chamber would be determined by the physical size of the capacitor that you
employ. Thus, the original laser chamber was about 12 inches long.
<p>
Half the challenge of building a laser from scratch is the quest for
affordable, usable materials.  If this proves impossible, the utilization of a
flat plate capacitor built from polyethylene plastic and copper or brass
sheets (it is possible to solder to copper and brass) may be attempted.
Polyethylene has a breakdown (or puncture voltage) rating of between 450 and
1,200 volts per mil (0.001 inch). Using multiple thinner sheets to build up
the dielectric is advised. This will have to be determined by experimentation.
<p>
What's desired is the thinnest possible dielectric which will effectively hold
off the applied potential on the plates. The dielectric constant of
polyethylene (2.2 to 2.3) is lower than the Epoxy circuit board material (up
to 5.2) so it's likely that a larger area will have to be used to be effective.
Brass shim stock (to use as the capacitor plates and for the laser chamber
electrodes) is readily available from most industrial supply stores.  I cannot
guarantee that this method will work in an N2 laser application, but it would
be a great learning experience nevertheless.
<p>
(From Professor Mark Csele (mcsele@niagarac.on.ca), (personal communication).)
<p>
<blockquote>
"Looking in the reference: "A Simple High-Powered Nitrogen Laser" in
 Opto-Electronics 4(1972)p.43, it describes formulae to characterize the
 transmission line.  In general, using 0.015" PCB the Z of the line ends up
 being 0.109 ohm (0.0363 ohm/m).  Literature suggests (but no conclusion)
 that Z must be below about 0.3 ohm to work.
<p>
 The formulae for Z is 0.5*(Zo/sqr(E))* s/L where Zo = 377 ohm (free space),
 E = 4.8 for Epoxy-glass board, s = 0.381mm thickness and L = 300 mm length of
 the laser cap."
</blockquote>
<p>
It certainly would be of great interest to many of us if indeed a thicker PCB
material would work in the original N2 laser design. I would encourage anyone
who has access to this material to experiment with it.  Calculations suggest
that perhaps one could use a PCB material as thick as 0.030", which would
withstand the higher voltage (21,000 volts) and still maintain a low enough
self-inductance to produce a short enough discharge to work.
<p>
(From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
<p>
Alas and alack, it turns out that the 1 kV/mil rating is only good at
1 mil thickness. With essentially ALL materials, the per-unit-thickness
dielectric strength goes down as the thickness goes up. It is crucially
important to take this into account.
<p>
If G-10 board (just for example) is rated at 1 kV per mil, then 15 mil
board is probably good for only about 12 kV <i>in extended use</i> (it
should take more on a single-shot or occasional basis), and 30-mil
board is probably only good for 20 kV. Once you puncture the board
you can throw away your laser, so it's a good idea to be a bit cautious
and conservative about how much voltage you put on it. (This is why
I'm using caps that are rated at 40 kV in my little 6 kV laser - it lets me
go to higher voltage without worrying, if and when I find an appropriate
spark gap.)

Through great pains and research I can also state the following, for the 
capacitor, MYLAR ROCKS. With a great dielectic constant (keep that 
impudence low) and durability, only mica comes close.  I picked some up at 
a craft shop under the name of Duralar.

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn25">So Why Didn't Ben Franklin Build One of These?</A></h3>

The Blumlein-switched capacitor UV lasers use some pretty basic technology,
readily available over two hundred years ago.  Too bad the concept of the
laser, let alone a working model, wasn't even a glimmer in anyone's eyes at
that time!  The following is extracted from a discussion on alt.lasers.
<blockquote>
"The N2 laser doesn't require sophisticated construction, so this bit about
 Ben Franklin seems reasonable. You just need a very fast voltage pulse to
 pump a nitrogen atmosphere to get some kind of laser output.  The Blumlein
 circuit is the switch recommended by the Scientific American Amateur
 Scientist article on the N2 laser that appears in "Light and It's Uses.""
</blockquote>
(Responses from: placayo@hotmail.com) unless otherwise noted).
<p>
I had it in the back of my head that input amperage also mattered somehow.  In
this case, milliamperes as generated by the usual laser power sources Van de
Graafs and Wimshurst machines put out mere microamps.  On the other hand, the
nanosecond switching in Blumlein's pulsar (such as in the Scientific American
column) guarantees an avalanche of current at high voltage in the laser
channel.  So, input current is not really critical.
<blockquote>
"I'm sure that Mr. Franklin could have devised something similar, had he
 realized a need for it.  He had access to electrostatic generators and Layden
 jars, which were early capacitors. It is conceivable that someone could take
 all these parts, along with the newly-discovered atmospheric gases (1772 for
 nitrogen) and vacuum pumps, and produce a nitrogen laser for the Continental
 Congress (1774 - 1789)."
</blockquote>
Or he could have gone the simpler route and used air as the lasing medium.  I
understand that air lases (even at normal pressure) when used in a traveling
wave laser.  It's a more likely scenario.  They were tireless and thorough
experimenters back then to a degree we rarely find today.  Some busy-body, Old
Ben perhaps, may have slapped together something resembling the Blumlein
switch, just to see what happens, fired it up, watched a curious fluorescence
in the long notch on one Leyden jar plate or capacitor plate, packed up and
went home.  He wouldn't have an idea that he had just invented a laser because
the output is UV and invisible.
<p>
There'd be no record of it consequently.  And history slips through his
fingers.  If the would-be inventor had been Ben Franklin, the device would
look exactly as it does today.  At one point, Franklin preferred flat-plate
capacitors in his work.  He popularized them. They called them "Franklin
squares", I think.
<p>
The traveling wave laser is one example of a technology that was sought for
because it was predicted by established theory.  But because of its simple
construction, it could just as easily be the sort of thing that might have
been invented by accident way before -- and ignored.
<blockquote>
"This business of Ben Franklin's nitrogen laser makes me wonder what
 inventions we could make with just the technology we have today? It reminds
 me of Babbage's calculating machine, which also would have brought
 technological usefulness to people centuries sooner."
</blockquote>
Or what old, "obsolete" inventions or long-discarded ideas might be
resurrected with the benefit of today's know-how and materials.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Of course, in Ben's time, there was no way to realize that laser action was
taking place or that such a thing was different than ordinary light anyhow,
no obvious way to see UV, or reason to even check for it.
<p>
For one to claim that an invention was created they either have to have sought
it out beforehand or understood the ramifications of the results of a
fortuitous experiment.  Neither of these were really possible for another
couple of centuries. :-)
<p>
(From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
<p>
As a person who has built several DIY room-pressure nitrogen lasers (which I
will freely admit worked rather poorly, but which did indeed work), I can
assure you that Ben Franklin was not *about* to do this. If he had access to
some kind of vacuum pump, it's possible that he might have seen something at
reduced pressure; one never knows. But an air laser? I doubt it. Air is an
impossibly lousy medium - not only does it not lase very well, it's a pain
in the neck to get a clean discharge in. A room-pressure laser? Forget it.
They're a wicked pain. It's next to impossible to get a sufficiently even
discharge; you have to resort to corona and/or UV preionization, which is not
exactly likely to happen by accident. In fact, it took years before people were
able to make room-pressure nitrogen lasers even on purpose, and some of those
people are really sharp.
<p>
A note on the gas fill: If I recall correctly from my perusal of the literature
(which I admit was a while ago), 0.3% oxygen is the optimum amount. You
actually get slightly improved performance and power output if you have about
this much oxygen in the mix. If you get more than half a percent, however, you
are already well past the peak, and as much as a full percent is harmful, yet
another reason why a Ben Franklin era laser would be unlikely.

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn26">Power Supply Requirements for the N2 Laser</A></h3>

The laser discharge circuit in the Nitrogen laser article in "Light and its
Uses" is just a homemade capacitor, inductor, and air spark gap - fired by
when the voltage climbs high enough.
<p>
Charging current is irrelevant except to the extent that it affects the
repetition rate and to overcome electrical leakage in the setup (which can
be quite minimal).  When the discharge takes place, it is all over in a few
dozen nanoseconds.
<p>
In fact, in the article, they suggest alternatives - their little transistor
ignition coil thing and a neon sign transformer.  It just affects the
repetition rate.  The transistor circuit probably puts out order of 10 uA at
20 kV (they say 1 percent efficiency!).  A neon sign setup, perhaps 2000 times
this.  When the spark gap fires, the current available from the charging
source is of no consequence.
<p>
If you are using the neon sign transformer approach, a high voltage bridge
rectifier is recommend even though it may be possible to run it on the raw AC.
(Each of the HV rectifiers of the bridge needs to have a PRV rating greater
than 1.414 times the RMS value of your transformer's maximum output - about 23
kV for a 15 kV transformer.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcps0">Power Supply Components</A>.)  The reason is
that the Blumlein capacitor will load the transformer reducing its peak
voltage.  A 1000 pF capacitor has an impedance of about 2.7M ohms at 60 Hz
(3.24M at 50 Hz).  The effective series resistance of a neon sign transformer
can vary between a few hundred K ohms and more than a M ohm depending on type
and size.  Thus, a voltage divider is formed, and depending on the size of the
caps in your laser (1000 pF is just an example) and the transformer you are
using, only a fraction of the transformer's peak voltage appears across the
capacitor and spark gap.  Using the rectifier will allow the caps to charge
until the spark gap triggers so it may operate on every 2nd or 3rd half-cycle
but at least it will fire eventually.
<p>
CAUTION: The spark gap is really loud.  Ear protection or a sound deadening
enclosure is highly recommended - especially at high rep rates!
<p>
It would be interesting to connect a Van De Graff or Wimhurst machine to such
a setup.
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
Well yes, I have fired my nitrogen laser by using my Wimshurst machine as the
charging source.  I just tried this on a whim, and it worked.  It does take a
little while to get the capacitors charged to firing potential though.  It is
a nifty combination of the old and the new.

<h3><A NAME="cn2mmn2">Making Measurements on an N2 Laser</A></h3>

You can actually record the discharge waveform fairly easily if you have a
high speed storage oscilloscope (doesn't everyone?):
<p>
(From: Pissavin (pissavin@aol.com).)
<p>
Making measurements on an operating N2 laser can be tricky.
Connecting an oscilloscope to a +20 kV charged capacitor isn't very easy
especially if you want to measure ns (nanosecond) phenomena.
<p>
I suggest 2 tricks to make measurements safely:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Mount a 1 turn, 10 mm diameter coil on axis with the N2 laser tube about
 40 mm away from it (make sure your HV can't jump to the coil!).  Connect the
 leads from the coil via a coaxial cable to a fast oscilloscope.  This is very
 simple and efficient.
<p>
<li>Disconnect the high voltage supply from the laser and replace it with a
 low voltage power supply and current limiting resistor (I suggest 10 VDC
 and 100 ohms).  Also install a reed switch in place of or in parallel to
 the spark gap.
<p>
 You can then use an ordinary scope probe everywhere safely and "fire" the gap
 by just moving a magnet near the reed switch.  With a TDS210 (a 1 Gsample/sec)
 scope, a 100 resistor+reed+X10probe+scope has about 3 ns rise time which seems
 enough.
<p>
 Connecting it to a Scientific American style N2 laser, you can see that
 there is no electrical wave: all of the capacitor plate is at the same voltage
 at a precise time.  You can also see a 20 ns fall time for the sparkling
 electrodes and a 50 ns fall time on the other electrode followed by a lot
 of oscillation. It's very interesting to compare the actual behavior to a
 Spice model result.  Of course, you don't see the plasma channel effect
 itself.  However, the reed switch is like a spark gap: a very simple, very,
 very fast switching device with low ON resistance.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn27">Jon's Comments on the SciAm N2 Laser</A></h3>

A more complete version of Jon's arguments can also be found at:
<A HREF=
"http://www.jossresearch.org/lasers/nitrogen/circuitboardlaser.html">Jon's
Rant on the Scientific American Nitrogen Laser</A>.
<p>
(From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
<p>
I believe I can make a convincing case for the conjecture that Jim Small's
discussion of how the laser works, as published originally in the magazine
and later in the book, is 100% bogus. He should have known better. In fact,
he ought to be ashamed of himself for not thinking it through.
<p>
Here are the relevant facts:
<ol>
<li>A Blumlein is a traveling-wave device. (We all agree on this part, even
 Small).
<p>
<li>A traveling-wave device cannot be appreciably smaller than its wavelength.
 (I do not know the absolute criterion, but I'd be willing to bet that if you
 get much shorter than half a wave, you aren't going to see a lot of wave.)
 This, of course, presumes that you have been able to create a traveling wave
 of discharge within the device, which leads directly to #3.
<p>
<li>In order to create a traveling wave of discharge in a circuit, you must
 switch the circuit in a time that is short with respect to the transit time
 of the device. Otherwise, a wavefront cannot ever develop -- the device simply
 behaves like a lumped-constant circuit (an LC tank circuit of some sort, with
 the usual inherent resistances) rather than a strip-line, which is a
 distributed-constant circuit.
</ol>
Now: let's take a look at the device. We already know that the output pulse is
about 6 ns long, which amounts to 6 feet in air, or approximately 4 feet in
copper. How big is the device? Does it have AT LEAST 2 feet of channel?  NO
WAY.
<p>
All right, let's look at the switch. The switch consists of a big loop of
copper that goes out around the edge of the circuit board, and has relatively
huge inductance. In order for this laser to operate as a real Blumlein, the
switching time certainly can't be any longer than half the size of the device
itself, which is maybe 2 nanoseconds. Therefore, if the switch does not fully
close in 1 ns or less, there is NO WAY that this device could EVER develop a
traveling wave even if it were big enough, which it is not.  The switch is
simply too slow to permit the development of any kind of wave whatsoever,
<p>
If Small (or anyone else) observes output that is not symmetrically divided
between the ends, there is some explanation other than "traveling-wave
excitation".
<p>
You are welcome to take this analysis to any electrical engineer with any
experience of traveling wave circuits or HV fast discharge. I am willing to
bet actual money that they'll back me up, at least to the extent of laughing
at Small's explanation. (I never bet more than a dime, because I hate taking
people's money from them, so I'll put a dime on this one.)
<p>
You can also think about it this way -- the laser channel is maybe a foot
long. That's one ns.  So okay, run a discharge wave down the channel.  This
takes one ns, and...  and... --> where do the other 5 nanoseconds of laser
pulse come from? <-- (Also, what's supposed to make the pulse be a whole lot
stronger in one direction than in the other??)
<p>
Well, so, okay, how about taking 6 nanoseconds for the wave to run along the
channel, so that it is active for the entire duration of the laser output
pulse. Great. Exactly *how* did you say you got the electrical wave to take
that long to travel a mere 12"? (...And again, what's supposed to make the
laser pulse be so much stronger in one direction than in the other?)
<p>
Has anyone actually measured a huge directional discrepancy in one of these
devices, BTW?
<p>
If you go back and look at the literature, by the way, you'll find a few other
interesting things.  There are two articles of particular interest with respect
to this set of issues.
<p>
<ul>
<li>One is a very fine N2 laser from about 1971 that developed about half a
 megawatt of output power. The authors state that they tried carefully to
 create a traveling wave, but were unable to see any evidence of one in their
 device.
<p>
<li>The other is a laser that demonstrably *did* create and use traveling-wave
 excitation: the first H2 Lyman-alpha laser.  It demonstrates another cogent
 point, which is that a single switch produces a circular wavefront, not a
 line. They had to use SEVEN switches to get a reasonably linear wave in their
 device (which did, indeed, have 10 times the output in the "forward" direction
 that it had in "reverse").
</ul>
<p>
It is possible to make a traveling wave laser, but you *really* have to work
at it. I certainly wouldn't claim to be capable, and I've done a bunch of
little laser things, up to & including a dye laser driver that is capable of
thresholding a dye cell without mirrors -- the reflections off the end windows
are enough with fluorescein or R6G. (This takes a certain amount of doing, as
I'm sure you are aware. I used a 0.089 uF cap, running at about 30 kV, in a
design that might conceivably interest you -- I made very sure it took nothing
heftier than a Dremel Moto-Tool to build the thing, because that was all I
had.)  (See the section: <A HREF="lasercdy.htm#cdyjdl">Jon's Dye Laser and
General Comments</A> for the exciting details.)
<p>
One other thing: a guy at Avco-Everett, back in the early 1970s, told me that
anybody who is careful about it can make a nitrogen laser that produces 100 kW
of output. He said it takes considerable effort to make a nitrogen laser that
puts out half a megawatt or more.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I wonder if some of this concern is more related to semantics than actual
bogosity. :)  If you look at the diagram in the original article, it is
clearly shows a circular wavefront (sorry for calling it something with 'wave'
in it) but not an actual traveling wave.  The edge of the circular area of
charge depletion intersects the discharge chamber at an oblique angle
resulting in the location of the discharge supposedly moving down the length
of the bore in a wave-like manner.  I do agree it isn't a traveling wave in
the normal electrical engineering sense but I'm not sure it is as terrible as
suggested above. :)
<p>
(From: Jon.)
<p>
The semantic issue is secondary to this fact: the circuit as designed and
built cannot possibly produce even the circular wavefront you mention from
Small's diagram, because the switch is orders of magnitude too slow. (I might
argue that "a traveling wave" may be circular, while "a laser that uses
traveling-wave excitation" probably needs a straight line, or something
approximating it.  In this case, the laser is so small that it wouldn't make
any difference even if it were capable of generating a wave, which is isn't -
the point is *doubly* moot!)
<p>
Here's the citation for the one of the papers I mentioned above:
<p>
<ul>

 laser", Jeffrey I. Levatter and Shao-Chi Lin, Applied Physics Letters,
 15 December, 1974, v25n12, p70.
</ul>
<p>
The relevant paragraph is:
<p>
<blockquote>
 "Measurements of the voltage pulse at the laser anode and
 spark gap cathode revealed spark gap rise times on the order of 10 to 12
 ns and rise times in the laser cavity of 7 to 8 ns, depending on
 the strip-line impedance.  Contrary to the reports of Basting
 et. al. (Note 5) and of Goddard (Note 6), there is no evidence that the
 parallel-plates- driven laser has been operating in the
 traveling-wave mode. As is obvious, with the observed voltage rise
 times on the order of 10 ns, no traveling wave can be obtained
 because the thickness of the corresponding wave front (~3 m) is
 substantially greater than any physical dimension of the
 strip-line. The resulting laser output is also observed to split
 equally between the forward and backward directions. The observed rise
 times, on the other hand, correspond nicely with the time constant
 calculated by adding the inductive and resistive times as follows
 (Note 7):
<PRE>
                       L        88              rho

   nanoHenries.
 <li>Z = impedance of the driving source in ohms.
 <li>E = the electric field in kV/mm.
 <li>rho/rho<sub>0</sub> = the ratio of the initial air gap density to standard
  atmospheric density.
 </ul>
 </blockquote>
<p>
(The formula is partly in Greek characters, and I'm using their names
here.  Tau, the time constant, comes out in ns.
<p>
Their laser, BTW, developed nearly 3 MW peak power under certain conditions,
as opposed to the puny few kW of Small's laser. It's a fine article. Here are
the citations for notes 5 and 6; note 7 is listed as "unpublished":
<p>
<ul>
<li>Note 5: D. Basting, F. P. Schaefer, and B. Steyer, Opto-Electronics
 4, 43 (1972).
<p>
 (That's actually an "a" with an umlaut over it in the middle
 of "Schaefer", and not really "ae".)
<p>
<li>Note 6: B. Goddard, IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics QE-10,
 147 (1974).
<p>
 They spell Bruno Godard's name "Goddard", but I remember
 it with one "d" in the middle. So go figure. He claimed some
 incredible amount of power out of his N2 laser, like 9 MW,
 but nobody was able to duplicate it, and he sort of disappeared
 after that -- I saw his presentation at CLEO (or whatever
 they were calling it at the time) in '73 or '74, and I'm not
 sure I ever saw him again after that.
</ul>
<p>
Here is another paper that might be of interest because it's quite easy to
build and produces about 150 kW under optimum conditions:
<p>
<ul>

 Pumping", Applied Optics, Feb 1973, v12n2, p183.

Here is a good transmission reference:

</ul>

Specifically, from <A HREF="
 http://www.kentech.co.uk/transmission_lines/Blumlein_pfl.html">Kentech's
 Blumlein Configuration Page</A> (linked from the page, above):
<blockquote>
 "Blumlein produced a transmission line configuration that delivers the
 charge voltage into a matched load. The cost of this is that there are
 two lines and the load impedance has to equal twice the impedance
 of each."
</blockquote>

Yet another reason why I contend that the use of the word "Blumlein" is
totally bogus with respect to nitrogen lasers.  Most of us wouldn't know a
transmission line if it bit us, and I include myself in that "us". :) I
might or might not recognize one on sight, and I'm certainly not up to
building them.  (And I'd bet that almost nobody can successfully match the
impedance of a discharge to two of them.)  Please note that the two lines have
to match each other as well.  This <b>is</b> rocket science, not just chopped
liver. ;-)
<p>
Hey, I just thought of one more reason why I don't believe Jim Small's
explanation:  You remember that nice sharp edge on the circular discharge wave
going out from the spark gap into the capacitor? Well, if the spark gap (which
is a nice big one-turn coil, as you'll see if you look at it, and is
<i>guaranteed</i> to be rather slow) takes a mere 2 ns to close, that lovely
sharp edge (just the edge, mind you) is <b>eighteen inches across</b>, about
the size of the entire laser! Have I convinced you yet, or do I need to get a
guy who has actually built strip-line discharge devices to back me up?

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn28">Comments on N2 Laser Construction</A></h3>

(From: (fannin@gte.net).)
<p>
I followed the development of nitrogen lasers from their beginning. You will
find most of the articles in Journal of Physics E Scientific Instruments in
about 1968 to 1975 but that was a long time ago. The dates are ballpark.
Nitrogen lasers can be used at atmospheric pressure with a helium nitrogen
mix. Sulfur hexafluoride changes the near ultraviolet lifetime. The length is
limited to about three feet in some designs with power output in the
MEGAWATTS. They can be more than a glorified flashtube. The voltages, RF,
flash, in short nearly everything about some of the designs can be deadly or
permanently maim you. The cavity and capacitor are simple but must be used
with the utmost caution. Study in depth first - then build!!!!!!
<p>
(From: Jon St Clair (Jon_St_Clair-QJS006@email.mot.com).)
<p>
I had a friend that made one of these once, but I never saw it operate.
<p>
It was a remarkably simple device and consisted of two sheets of metal
separated by a dielectric like a sheet of Plexiglas.  The lower sheet, viewed
from the end, was shaped like the letter "J" laying on its back.  The upper
sheet was positioned so that a spark gap formed between the hook of the J and
one edge of the upper plate.
<p>
The spark gap was covered on top with plastic so that nitrogen could flow
along the spark gap.  The spark gap was slightly more narrow on one end
than the other.
<p>
When a DC high voltage charged up what was essentially a parallel plate
capacitor, a nitrogen arc forms at one end of the spark gap.  At least one
photon of UV causes ionization of the nitrogen right next to it line with the
spark gap and results in a spreading out of the discharge along the length of
the spark gap.
<p>
The spark starts at one end of the gap, propagates at the speed of light along
the gap adding energy to a coherent packet of photons as they travel along the
gap.  I am not clear on this, but I think that the pulse width of the laser
may be equal to the length of the spark gap divided by the speed of light.
This is a very very short period of time, and if the conversion efficiency of
the energy stored in the parallel plate into coherent UV is some reasonable
amount(?) then the peak power could be huge. x-Watts/second divided by a very
small number of seconds!
<p>
I think obtaining a source of nitrogen and finding a optically clear
(at the UV wavelength) and distortion free lens for one end of the spark gap
was the only hard stuff other than building a high voltage DC power
supply (and that is not hard).
<p>
When you hook up a continuous DC supply, you get a burst, it charges up
again, bursts, charge up again etc.  I understand it will really light
up UV dyes some distance away.
<p>
(From: Dr. Peter Schellenberg (peter.schellenberg@physik.uni-ulm.de).)
<p>
Among the lasers described in "Light and its Uses" and other Amateur Scientist
articles, I guess the nitrogen laser is the cheapest one, since you do not
even need mirrors, and can go around with some handmade stuff and school
equipment.  The electrical discharge is done by a home-made capacitor in a
so-called Blumlein arrangement. (Something similar can also be done to build a
CO2 laser. However, in this case you need mirrors, preferentially gold
mirrors. Don't be shocked, these are not that expensive).
<p>
By using a cylindrical lens, you can focus the beam from the N2 laser in a
cuvette with almost any dye and get superradiant laser emission from it.
<p>
There are also a lot of descriptions for laser construction in the following
scientific journals:
<ul>
<li>IEEE Journal of quantum electronics
<li>Optics communications
<li>Optics letters
</ul>
However, there is never a part list included, for this you have to use your
brain!
<p>
I prefer older articles, lets say between 1965 and 1980, some of the lasers at
that time were not as complicated (and expensive!) as later designs.
<p>
Note that there are only few lasers that can really build with less than a few
100$.
<p>
(From: Richard Alexander (RAlexan290@gnn.com).)
<p>
Building a good nitrogen laser is almost trivial, and low-cost.  All you have
to do is send a 20 kV arc across a spark gap in a moderately low pressure
(100 torr, a little more than 1/10th atmosphere) nitrogen environment.  The
output is crude, but $15,000 nitrogen lasers don't make a much better beam
than a $200 device (the difference between the two appears to be versatility
and electrical noise suppression).
<p>
(From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
<p>
The more expensive ones are easier to work, and they typically deliver an
order of magnitude more power & pulse energy. (Yes, you can build a fairly
cheap N2 laser that works really well, but they are not common. If you look at
the Levatter & Lin design, for example (which, at 1 to 3 MW, is one of the
better N2 laser designs I've seen), you'll observe that it must have cost
plenty to build. The nice little Schenck & Metcalf laser, which costs about
$200 to build, gives maybe 160 kW, no big surprise.)  (See the section:

I have just re-built my N2 laser and have substituted a PVC pipe in place of
the Plexiglas box. This withstands the vacuum much better than the box
design. The box would contract whenever the vacuum was applied and was prone
to leaks. I have recently obtained a cylinder of compressed nitrogen gas (for
free!) to use in this laser.  With the leak-proof construction and the pure N2
gas, the output of this laser has increased dramatically. I have no way of
measuring the output power, but when the beam strikes a fluorescent piece of
paper, it is so bright that it is somewhat uncomfortable to look at. UV
protective eye ware is worn at all times, but these are clear to visible
light.
<p>
I am in the process of building a small dye head to be pumped by the output of
this N2 laser.  I have heard that many of the dyes will 'lase' superradiantly
when pumped by such a source. As these dye heads are of simple construction, I
will build some with resonant optics and some without.  This should be a very
interesting area of experimentation.
<p>
(From: Frank Roberts (Frank_Roberts@klru.pbs.org).)
<p>
The supply needed to excite a nitrogen laser is basically a
capacitive-discharge DC supply.  The high voltage AC from the transformer is
diode-rectified to DC and then applied across a suitably rated capacitor.
Since a 15 kv neon sign transformer is rated at 15 kv RMS (average), the
actual peak voltage from the transformer is greater than that by a factor of
the square root of two (1.414).  This means that a 15kv transformer will
charge the capacitor up to 15 kV x 1.414, or over 21 kV.  This is plenty of
oomph for a Nitrogen laser.  Be careful, this voltage applied across a
capacitor is deadly!  If you need more voltage, two diodes and two capacitors
can be connected in the form of a voltage doubler.  Your 15kv transformer will
now provide 42.42 kilovolts of pump energy.  You'll find that these voltages,
capacitors and diodes can become expensive.  One way around this is to connect
your neon transformer to a relatively inexpensive voltage tripler.  These are
used in some color TV sets to get the 30 to 45 kV needed for the picture tube.
These are potted modules containing all the capacitors and diodes in one unit.
You can salvage them from broken TVs or buy them new at any electronics parts
house.

<h3><A NAME="cn2ray1">Ray's Plans to Build an N2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Ray (PGInverse@my-dejanews.com).)
<p>
If you search for Bruno Godard's patents you find some most interesting stuff
on his N2 lasers, which may reach a 1% efficiency!!!  I plan to build a laser
based on these designs.
<p
Basically Godard's laser uses the Blumlein switch, but with a parabolic
shape for the copper plate, and the spark gap placed on the focus of that
parabola.  This way, he produces a nearly linear electric 'shock wave'.
The laser channel is disposed in such a way that the discharge travels
uniformly at the speed of light inside the channel.
<p>
The UV impulse is always coupled to the discharge along the channel and the
efficiency rises significantly.  He also uses a pressurized spark gap in order
to get a faster discharge.
<p>
It took me over a month to dimension and calculate everything, from the power
supply caps to the correct angle between the channel and the EM shock wave.  But
NOW I've all the data I need, and I have also nearly all of the materials
required to build this monster.
<p>
I'll begin the construction ASAP and if everything works as expected, provide
the URL of a page describing this beast.
<p>
Now some actual data:
<ul>
<li>Blumlein area: 2 square meters.
<li>Shape: Half parabola.
<li>Channel angle: 45 degrees from the axis of the parabola.
<li>Channel length: 1.4 m.
<li>Channel width: 1 cm.
<li>Working pressure: 30 to 100 Torr.
<li>Lasing material: Cheap air :-) (or nitrogen, in the future).
<li>Power supply: 26 kVDC, around 200 W average power.
<li>Dielectric: Polyethylene, multilayer, 2 mm thick.
<li>Spark gap: Pressurized at 3 to 12 atm.
<li>Copper plate: 1 mm thick.
</ul>
And now what I expect it to do:
<ul>
<li>Expected efficiency: At least 0.5%.
<li>Expected average power: 1 W  (0.2 W minimum, 2 W maximum).
</ul>
To get 1 W I'd have needed say a 1 kW power supply, with all the
connected cooling problems.  Now I only need 200 or maybe even 100 W. :-))))
<p>
Of course the dielectric is pretty thick, so the laser has to be really big,
but I desired to have my dielectric live a long life.
<p>
Also, this laser can be easily modified to get, say a 50 mJ impulse with a
20 Hz rep rate.

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn28a">Rich's Comments on N2 Laser Safety, Home-Built Versus
 Commercial Unit, More</A></h3>

(From: Richard Alexander (pooua@aol.com).)
<p>
The nitrogen laser produces UV light - lots and lots of UV light! It is
similar to the light from an electric arc welder, which gives welders a
sunburn after a few hours.
<p>
I've seen 2 N2 lasers in operation, and they had quite different beams. The
first one was a home-built unit by the inventor of the N2 laser (he used to
teach at UNM). I remember it had a pencil-like beam. Of course, the beam
itself was invisible, but the UV light made the air fluoresce (blue, I
think). The demonstrators may have used collimating lenses to direct the beam
across the display room.
<p>
The second N2 laser was the $85 000 commercial unit used by my school. The
difference between a $100 home-built N2 laser and an $85,000 commercial unit
is that the commercial unit has advanced electronic controls for such things
as O-scope triggering and remote control, the power supply is more
sophisticated, and the electrode separation and angle also could be manually
adjusted using plastic screws. Other than that, the home-built is just as good
as the commercial unit, especially for the hobbiest.
<p>
The beam of the commercial unit diverged rapidly and flickered a lot. This is
characteristic of N2 lasers. The beam from an N2 laser resembles the
flickering light from a welder's electrode, as it should, considering that the
two are physically quite similar.
<p>
The actual output beam is just one source of UV light from the N2 laser.
All of the spark discharges also emit large amounts of UV light. The
commercial units shield most of the discharges within the body of the
laser. The home-built that I saw used a spark-gap trigger on the main
capacitor. The gas was excited using a long gap between 2 sheets of copper.
Both of these spark gaps give off lots of eye-damaging UV light, and probably
could give someone a sunburn after several hours of operation.
<p>
I don't recall what safety glasses we used in laser school for our N2 laser. We
didn't use any special body protection that I recall, although we may all have
worn long-sleeved shirts. Also, we were taught to treat all laser radiation as
dangerous (meaning, for example, that we were not supposed to allow any part of
our body to cut the beam of even a HeNe laser). The idea was that if we trained
to respect the beam, it would become automatic, and then we would avoid
high-powered beams by habit. Either that, or we would get some interesting
scars,
<p>
We had no difficulty in using the N2 laser to pump dyes. It was actually
anticlimatic. We had a 50 kW N2 UV laser output. We chose a dye, which was in
an ordinary, square cross-sectioned quartz cuvette. The laser beam struck the
cuvette and excited the dye. The walls of the cuvette acted as mirrors. Out
came 2 visible laser beams, each about half the power of the N2 beam. BTW, yes,
quartz absorbs UV light. That doesn't much matter when the quartz walls are
only a few mm thick and the UV light is a 50 kW beam.
<p>
Another interesting point is that the laser cavity of our commercial N2 laser
was only about 5 cm long. The plans from Scientific American use a tube about
40 cm long (give or take several cm), and produces a 100 kW beam. Increase the
cavity length to 1 m, and the output power reaches 1 MW. No matter what you do,
though, the pulse will only be a few nanoseconds long (about 30 ns for the 1
meter tube, if you propagate the discharge from one end to the other).

<h3><A NAME="cn2dclnt">Diane's Comments on Lasers of the N2 Type</A></h3>

(From: Diane Neisius (diane_va@yahoo.com).)
<p>
I wonder why so many people have got difficulties concerning N2
lasers. I've built a couple of them, and I find it hard NOT to get at
least a bit of coherent UV light out of them, as long as you limit
yourself to some very basic guidelines. I got laser output from a tube
only 10 cm long with electrode spacing of 5 mm as well as from 20 and
30 cm long ones with spacing 15 mm using N2, air and several He-N2
mixtures, and finally from a 80 cm long segmented-bore type I got
still more gases to lase.
<p>
<b>Rule #1:</b> Stay near the correct electric field versus pressure ratio.
(This also holds for all other gas lasers a well.)  For the N2 337.1 nm line,
this is roughly:
<p>
<PRE>
          E/p = 200 V/(cm * Torr)
</PRE>
<p>
Due to my power supply delivered max 10 kV (DC), for an electrode
spacing of 15 mm this calculates to an electric field of approx.  6700
V/cm thus requiring a pressure of roughly 34 torr. However, the output
maximum is very broad if plotted against the pressure; I saw coherent
output in a pressure range from 5 to 80 Torr (in 20 cm tube up to 200
Torr), so matching it was quite easy.
<p>
<b>Rule #2:</b> Keep the length and width of the Blumlein in reasonable range.
<p>
If you're interested only in a high-power rough-design N2 laser, keep
in mind that the energy stored in a capacitor reads
<p>
<PRE>
         W = 1/2 * C * V<sup>2</sup>
</PRE>
<p>
where C is the capacity and V the voltage. Obviously the energy
increases by the square of the voltage, so apply brute HIGH voltage to
your laser if it can stand that (at own risk), and remind Rule #1.
<p>
All else who are somewhat limited by their power supplies (like me)
can follow the more economic path.  The Blumlein capacity is the
limiting factor of the energy you can put into a single pulse (for a
given voltage). A capacitor can be enlarged in several ways - increase
the area, decrease the thickness of the dielectric, use a dielectric
of high efficiency.  Nevertheless there are some limits. Usually you
haven't much choice about dielectrics. Its thickness has to withstand
a breakthrough of the feeding voltage (usually quite high), and you
can't get all dielectrics in suitable form but have to restrict
yourself to some common plastic sorts. I mostly used soft PVC which
allows wrapping the Blumlein around the tube.  So, what remains seems
to be enlarging of the area.  But this also is somewhat restricted:
the length of the laser defines the width of the Blumlein leaving only
the Blumlein's length as a free parameter. You can't make it endless
long, for the length of the Blumlein determines the duration of the
discharge pulse. If this one is made longer than the possible laser
pulse duration (typically 5 ns for most N2 lasers I read about), it's
simply wasted energy. As a thumb rule, I kept the length and the width
of the Blumlein roughly the same size for a common short N2, but made
it never longer than 50 cm per strip line (for PVC as dielectric).
<p>
So we are a little bit restricted in design.  Nevertheless one can
proceed if squeezing the discharging energy into a smaller gas
volume. This directly leads to
<p>
<b>Rule #3:</b> Make the discharge volume as small as possible.
<p>
Most N2 laser tubes are built in a "box style". If the output of such
lasers is watched, it shows up to be a pretty good image of the
cross-section of the tube. This is (to my experience) independent of
the electrode shape. Of course laser emission always is strongest from
the room between the electrodes, but at least in pure N2 from all the
other space inside the tube weaker emission also occurs. This means,
the (limited) energy is spread to a relatively large volume in an
inefficient way. Thus, e.g. 15 mm separated electrodes in a 50 x 50 mm
cross-section box are quite a waste (in this case, I usually took an
acrylic tube of only 16 mm (!) inner diameter).
<p> 
To reduce volume further would be the next step, but (what a surprise)
this is limited. Especially the electrode spacing cannot be varied
much for a given voltage - if too close, the pressure has to go up
(remember we have to keep E/p constant?) which destabilizes the
discharge.  Parametric studies suggested to go not below 10 mm spacing
due to massive development of arcs (can't remember the exact
reference, sorry).
<p>
For these reasons I adopted the tube design of the VUV H2 laser by
Kirkland, Dogett and Kim to my needs. These guys divided the "blade"
shaped electrodes found in common N2 lasers into a series of "pin"
electrodes. So the discharge was segmented in between the alternating
pins along the tube - which made it possible to preserve the electrode
separation of 15 mm although the bore was just 3 mm wide. (I will give
a more detailed description of this baby soon).
<p>
What is the advantage of so much effort? Obviously the electrical
energy of the Blumlein was concentrated to a *significantly* smaller
volume. This meant stronger inversion i. e. higher gain i. e. "easier"
lasing. As a side effect, due to the narrow bore the divergence of the
beam became much smaller. But most impressive is the fact I got
superradiant laser action in gases that didn't oscillate in my common
N2 laser tubes, namely the green and orange Ne lines. It ended up that
the laser, originally planned for N2, ran nearly all the time as green
Ne laser. E/p for the green neon at 540.1 nm is approximately 80 V/(cm*Torr)
- if you like to try it in your laser, too. :)
<p>
Another comment about the safety of N2 style lasers: The spark gap not
only produces lots of UV but also ozone. If running uncovered, it
begins to irritate eyes and throat after some time (despite of the bad
smell), think about some kind of spark gap vent or ozone filter.

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn29">Increasing the Power Output of the N2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: James Lockwood (james@foonly.com).)
<p>
The reason that N2 lasers don't scale up with increasing pulse power is
that it's very easy to excite the entire volume of gas in your chamber.
Dumping more power into it doesn't help much after that point, while
sharpening the power rise curve helps you maximize the excitation
produced.
<p>
What is much easier to do is to increase pulse frequency.  N2 lasers can
be boosted to many thousands of pulses per second with gas flow and a well
designed power supply.  Even a Tesla style rotary spark gap will get you
there.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Boosting the high voltage or capacitor size isn't the way to go. Increase the
length of the laser tube itself to a meter or so and then move the Blumlein
spark gap to one corner to introduce a traveling wave so the gain follows the
coherent light down the tube.

<h3><A NAME="cn2tsg">Triggered Spark Gap for N2 Laser</A></h3>

These schemes may come in handy for your larger home-built N2 lasers:
<p>
(From: hermance@ridgenet.net.)
<p>
I built a triggered spark gap for a nitrogen laser that would dump a rather
large cap charged at 30 kV. It is a quite simple switch, although a
miss-fire can feed back some nasty transients if one is not careful.
<p>
Create a small chamber out of two pieces of Plexiglas, one 1" thick, the
other 1/2". In the 1" thick piece, approximately 2" x 2" square, mill a hole
1" in diameter and 1/2" deep.  From the sides, drill and tap 1/8" NPT. Top is
connected to a nitrogen supply, bottom is connected to a vacuum pump. The
sides are brass rod - these are the electrodes of the "switch". Use a lathe to
create various penetrations into the cavity at different depths, (with a 1/8"
NPT thread at the back end).  On the 1/2" thick piece, drill and tap for a
automotive spark plug and connect it to an automotive spark coil. Clamp both
pieces together using silicone grease, (e.g., Dow 111) and screws.  Drill a
small hole about 3/8" from each corner, (like 8-32) do not tighten any more
than slightly more than finger tight.
<p>
Evacuate the chamber to about 10 torr.  When the spark plug is fired, the
nitrogen gas is ionized by the slight amount of UV, and the two electrodes
can conduct approximately 1,000 amps within a few nanoseconds.
<p>
(From: Joshua Dickerson (jdickerson3@satx.rr.com).)
<p>
The performance of lasers needing closely timed operation pulses would
greatly benefit from the use of field distortion spark gaps with
asymmetrical trigger placement.  In this scheme, both halves of the spark
gap break down simultaneously as opposed to forming a cascade discharge
familiar with the popular mid-plane triggered gaps.  Cascade discharges add
to the delay, jitter and commutation time of the overall breakdown.
Simultaneous over-voltage mode, as it is called, permits extremely fast, low
jitter sequencing that would open new possibilities for amateur lasers.
Take for instance, CuCl (or other lasers requiring disassociation), TEA N2,
and Master Oscillator Power Amplifier setups.  Now you can make that
electrically pumped atomic iodine laser you always wanted. ;)

<h3><A NAME="cn2cwl">Why isn't There a CW N2 Laser?</A></h3>

The lasing process of the N2 laser is self terminating and is thus inherently
a pulsed system though a quasi-CW N2 laser with a very high pulse repetition
rate may be constructed,  How high this can be pushed will depend on the
capabilities of the technology to circulate the gas and provide the huge
amount of power to excite the discharge.  It takes around 40 ms for the N2
to return to the ground state from a non-lasing metastable state (somewhat
dependent on pressure).  So, without some means of clearing the used gases
from the discharge channel, maximum energy pulses will only be obtained at
firing rates less than 20 or 25 Hz. Commercial N2 lasers may operate at 1 kHz
or more but only with very fast gas flow.   In any case, true CW operation is
not possible even in theory.
<p>
(From: Michael Andrus (andrus@ccountry.net).)
<p>
Actually the fact that N2 needs to be at a non excited state before it can
be re-excited is the whole reason.  Lasers operate in very specific
conditions.  This particular laser is super radiant.  This assures that it
is a pulsed laser.  The atoms become excited at the same time and release
there energy in just a few passes through the laser tube.  This prevents
continuous operation.  A CW laser only requires some of the atoms to be in
the upper energy levels.  This allows them to excite the atoms at the lower
energy levels while other atoms are emitting light.
<p>
(From: Jeff Brandenburg (brand@nina.pagesz.net).)
<p>
The N2 laser self-terminates in a (very) few nanoseconds.  To maintain CW or
nearly CW operation, you'd need to clear the channel every few nanoseconds.
If you do the math, you'll find that even with transverse flow you'd need
near-relativistic gas velocities.  If you can produce a flow of unexcited N2
gas at a significant fraction of an atmosphere pressure with a velocity of
(say) 1/100 c (where c = the velocity of light in a vacuum = 300,000,000 m/s),
I submit that that flow of gas will be *much* more impressive than a measly UV
laser beam. :-)
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
Let's take a look at the practical aspects of just the power requirements for
a DC excited quasi-CW N2 laser (not including the equipment or the power
need to replace the warm N2 gas). Each time the laser produces its few
nanosecond (~5 ns?) pulse, it requires that the capacitor discharges through
the laser channel. You would, of course, have to allow the capacitor to
recharge before the laser could produce another pulse. In order to charge even
the relatively small capacitor of the SciAm N2 laser to let's say 20,000 volts
every five nanoseconds, would require a power supply capable of delivering
about 60,000 amps at 20,000 volts (from the formula I = C * dV/t). I'll let
you figure out how many watts that represents.  Better get started on building
your power plant. :-)

<p>
 If I'm firing up the system, it doesn't want to create any kinds of
 laser radiation. I'm despairing!!  PLEASE HELP!!"
</blockquote><p>
I have built a few of these in my time (and have run this project for first
year undergrad students), and there are some critical points to watch out for.
First off, SAFETY, these things can kill you if you get a good solid shock
from them, so take care and follow all the usual high voltage handling
guidelines.  If you or your supervisor haven't done HV work before, then I
strongly suggest you get someone who has to look over your working practices
etc.  Make very sure the PCB capacitor and power supply are properly
discharged before you go near it.  Remember that 7 kV can jump a fair way
across surfaces to fingers etc.
<p>
Ok, with that bit out of the way, you need to check the following points.
<ol>
<li>Does the spark gap break down?  If not, then decrease the gap spacing until
   it does (Do this in 1 mm stages, with HV turned OFF in between).  Note
   that the spark emits lots of UV and should be enclosed in a plastic shield
   of some kind.
<p>
<li>When the gap breaks down, do you see a discharge across the laser channel?
   It should be a fairly uniform pink/purple color.  If you see isolated
   sparks instead the nitrogen pressure is too high.  If you see a faint glow,
   with white hot spots then pressure may be too low.  You need about 1/5th
   atmospheric pressure.
<p>
<li>N2 from a gas cylinder is MUCH better than air.  Flowing N2 at the right
   pressure works best.  Good control of the N2 pressure is CRITICAL for
   getting this thing to work.  Oxygen free nitrogen (OFN) the very cheapest
   commercial grade is fine and only a few $ per bottle.  You do however need
   some gas handling valves etc.
<p>
<li>How are you looking for the laser output?  It's in the UV and the best way
   is to look for a blue/purple fluorescence from a piece of photocopying
   paper or some such.  You won't get a very good beam from the laser, as
   there are no resonator mirrors.  Its a horrible rectangular blob with very
   bad divergence.
<p>
<li>What windows are you using?  Quartz is better than ordinary glass as it has
   higher UV transmission.
</ol>
Have fun and take care!

<h3><A NAME="cn2cn2b">How About an Air Laser?</A></h3>

The N2 laser "Light and its Uses" article suggests that it might be possible
to use ordinary air instead of pure N2.  However, there doesn't' seem to be any
confirmation of this.  From a recent posting on the USENET newsgroup
<A HREF="news:sci.optics">sci.optics</A>:

<blockquote>
"I was wondering if anyone here who is a laser nut has been successful in

know how, please let me know."
</blockquote>

(From: Bret Cannon (bret.cannon@pnl.gov).)
<p>
According to the manual for an old Molectron nitrogen laser, even small amounts
of oxygen cause arcing in the discharge and prevents lasing.
<p>
(From: Nigel Tolley (ntolley@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Almost. Oxygen is very effective in stopping laser action. It hasn't got
anything to do with arcing, as you can set up a laser so that it lases
rapidly on flash-over (How most pulsed lasers work) but oxygen disrupts your
lasing paths. If you have an old He-Ne tube where the seals have let in
some air, you can see the problem. Lots of UV-blue glow, but no laser beam.
<P>
Having said all that, if you got well tuned selective wavelength mirrors,
you could perhaps get a "blue" HeNeO laser.  Anyone got a few thousand for a
research project??

(From: Sam.)
<p>
With current overhead rates for government funded research, $1,000,000 might
be a more realistic number to put in your grant proposal. :-)
<p>
(From: localnet (localnet@hotmail.com).)
<p>
Actually it is possible to use air as the lasing medium in place of pure N2.
Oxygen is not that bad and helps to improve the repetition rate by carrying
away energy from N2. Repetition rates of 100 Hz are quite easy to get even
without gas flow. With gas flow you can get to 1 kHz.  However you get 1/5th
the power of a laser using pure N2 and it requires a voltage of over 20 kV.
It will run between about 30 and 100 Torr with the best value around 80 Torr.
The setup is otherwise similar to the SciAm N2 laser.
<p>
You may want to improve the design though, like by cutting the copper plate
with a parabolic shape.
<p>
Oh, and BTW, it is possible to make a laser out of water.  A water vapor laser
is known that lases at 28 um and 115 um.  This is *far* infrared and not very
useful, but it is actually possible.  Note that 115 um are macroscopic waves -
.115 mm!
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Well, saying that they are not very useful is a bit extreme.  Who knows what
may come along.  Also, at long wavelengths like that, the lasing mechanism is
more likely to be similar to that of a CO2 laser - molecular vibrational
modes - than to an N2 laser.

I think the second part of the answer to this question is if you take a stroll
through an industrial or academic lab - and I have strolled through a lot of
them - you will find plenty of argon, YAG, CO2, dye, Ti:Sapphire, and
nowadays, diode and diode pumped lasers.  Not to mention HeNe lasers.  Every
once in a while you will notice a nitrogen laser.  There just aren't that many
out there.  While I am not debating their true usefulness, they seem to be
somewhat limited in lab use due to their low output power, both peak and
average, compared to other laser sources.  They might be the most convenient
lasers to operate or build, but that doesn't mean much when you get them into
the lab.  Well most of the time it doesn't. :)  I sat down and tried hard to
remember how many times I have seen nitrogen lasers in the lab, and most every
time I could think of, if UV was desired, a tripled or quadrupled YAG was
used.  Or an excimer if power requirements were high.  The only lab that I
could remember using a lot of N2 lasers was a small optics house that was
fooling around growing novel gain materials.  They had a lot of short
wavelength spectroscopy and other similar application and did not need a lot
of power to do their work.

<h3><A NAME="cn2dye">Which Dye for N2 Laser Pumped Dye Laser?</A></h3>

Start with Rhodamine 6G, if you can get it, in isopropyl alcohol from
the drugstore. (High-strength, 91% or 99% purity, is best. Regular
isopropyl rubbing alcohol will also work, but you will want to avoid any
that is colored.) This combination almost lases if you look at it hard!
It will go superluminescent, or lase off the cell window reflections if
the windows are well aligned, very easily. You can usually tell the
difference, BTW &#151; if you get  <A HREF="http://www.jossresearch.org/pictures/lasers/dye/n2pumped/c8421c.dtc.nofocus.12c.jpg"> a tall stripe of output with no obvious bright
areas</A> [from a relatively concentrated dye solution] or a cloudy glow
[from a solution that is somewhat less concentrated], you are almost
certainly seeing superluminescence. OTOH, if there is a bright spot, as

<h3><A NAME="cn2pwth">Comments on N2 Laser Pulse Width</A></h3>

(From: Jon Singer, of the Joss Research Institute.)
<p>
I've been reading a bunch of articles, and I notice a very peculiar thing
about low-pressure N2 lasers.
<p>
We all know that N2 bottlenecks in the lower level, and we all know that
low-pressure N2 lasers usually run for 6 to 8 nsec, right? The natural
conclusion is that bottlenecking is what's shutting them down.
<p>
Almost all of the really high-power or high-energy machines, however, have
largish caps in them (20 nF and up), and almost all of them lase for ~15 nsec;
some go even longer.
<p>
I've found one article that addresses this issue, and what they note is that
there are _two_ things that can shut down a nitrogen laser. The first is the
one we already know about: if you pump them correctly, bottlenecking shuts
them down after 15 or 20 nsec (somewhat longer if there's SF6 in the gas mix).
<p>
What shuts down the little ones is something different.
<p>
Turns out that direct electron impact is what excites the nitrogen
molecules. Further turns out that the electrons have to acquire at least 11 eV
of energy between collisions (if I remember correctly) in order to do the job;
15 eV is more optimal.
<p>
If the electron temperature in the discharge falls below this level, pumping
ceases; and lasing ceases very shortly thereafter, as stimulated emission
depletes the population inversion. A capacitor of only a few nF, charged to
relatively low voltage, just can't sustain a sufficiently intense discharge
for long enough to reach the bottleneck point.
<p>
I'm thinking about building a fairly large machine, to see whether I can get
the longer pulses out of it.

The NL-100 consists of a high voltage power supply and trigger generator,
and a replaceable "plasma cartridge".  This approach is similar to other
small N2 lasers.  The
plasma cartridge includes a ceramic laser tube with parallel electrodes running
nearly the entire length, voltage multiplier, low inductance high voltage
capacitor, and triggered spark gap.  Large area formed copper sheet metal
plates attach the cap/spark gap to the laser tube electrodes.  The electrical
inputs are high voltage AC from the external power supply and a high voltage
trigger pulse.  The output is a signal for HV feedback.
<p>
Here are some photos of the SRS NL-100B.  I'm not sure what the "B" means.
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="nl100-fi.jpg">SRS Model NL-100B Nitrogen Laser - Front Interior
 View</A>.  The plasma cartridge can be replaced in about 2 minutes.  That is,
 once the 30 cover screws are removed, just a bit excessive! :)  The 26 screws
 that hold the plasma cartridge cover in place seem to be even more excessive
 since the interior is filled entirely with white potting compound.
<p>
<li><A HREF="nl100-bi.jpg">SRS Model NL-100B Nitrogen Laser - Back Interior
 View</A>.  The high voltage power supply has two outputs.  The lower one is
 high frequency AC directly from the inverter transformer which feeds the
 voltage multiplier in the plasma cartridge.  The upper one is a HV
 pulse to the triggered spark gap in the plasma cartridge.  The only
 feedback is via the orange wire from a voltage divider inside the plasma
 cartridge to control the high voltage output.
<p>
<li><A HREF="nl100-fc.jpg">SRS Model NL-100B Nitrogen Laser Fiber
 Coupler</A>.  This assembly screws to the front of the NL100 laser.
 There is a standard Newport fiber launcher inside the black
 cover feeding an SMA 200 &micro;m multimode fiber.  It is not
 known whether the fiber itself is anything special for 337 nm.
 The fiber loop samples the beam before the focusing optics
 and provides an electrical output to monitor the actual laser pulse.
<p> 
<li><A HREF="nl100-pd.jpg">SRS Model NL-100B Nitrogen Laser Plasma Cartridge
 Disassembled</A>.  (This and the next photo courtesy of Dave Jenkins
 (www.dmanufacturing.com), who removed most of the
 potting compound: "I dived right in with a 12 inch chef's knife and small
 paring knife, and basically de-boned the sucker!  Took about 4 hours total.")
 The energy storage capacitor is the object in front; the triggered spark
 gap is behind it.  The laser tube with its exhaust tip-off (covered with
 black heatshrink tubing) can be seen attached to them via copper
 plates.  The voltage multipler PCB is on the bottom with its red 2 pin
 AMP connector for power supply voltage monitoring.  The sockets for
 HV AC and HV TRIG can be seen hanging near the backplate in the rear.
<p>
<li><A HREF="nl100-ta.jpg">SRS Model NL-100B Nitrogen Laser Tube Assembly</A>.
 The triggered spark gap with its trigger electrode is visible in the front.
 Although the glass plates on the front and rear of the laser tube look
 similar, it is not known whether the rear one (on the left) is really a
 mirror, but that's highly likely as there is a large uncovered hole in
 the plasma cartridge behind it and the components there might get a bad
 case of Sun burn if it was not! :)
</ul>
<p>
Powering the NL-100 is very easy requiring only 24 VDC at 3 A peak.  With
a big filter capacitor on the output, 1.5 A is really enough.  While there is a
strange power connector on the rear panel, it's also possible to feed power
in via the DB9 control connector and this is mentioned in the operation
manual.  Power and an interlock jumper are all that are needed to use the
internal pulse generator with the backpanel repetition rate control.  There
is also a trimpot for adjusting the high voltage accessible through a hole
on the right side of the case.  This can be used to maintain output power
as the plasma cartridge degrades with use.
<p>
The first NL-100 I acquired operated in all respects, including a satisfying
ticking sound, but produced no UV output.  And I wasn't going to stare down
the end of the tube to see if there was a discharge!  Since the laser tube
is filled at a relatively high pressure, slight leakage shouldn't be a problem
even though it is soft-sealed.  This differs from HeNe or ion lasers where
the fill pressure is very low and any contamination through the Epoxy
or TorrSeal or whatever spells doom.  However, there could always be a
manufacturing defect resulting in a high rate of leakage.  But it may be some
other problem, but most likely the plasma cartridge is simply dead.
<p>
The next laser I acquired, actually a Bruker NL-110B, is physically
identical except for the paint job, but works very well.  I assume that
it is still made by SRS bu Bruker insisted on their own decorative scheme. :)
It's definitely peppy and almost anything the beam hits fluoresces intensely.
:)  I measured the average power at the maximum repetition rate of around
3.5 mW, which is just about spec (170 &micro;W at 20 pps).  There is still
headroom on the HV adjust, though I don't know how much.

<h3><A NAME="cn2sp337">Spectra-Physics VSL-337i OEM Nitrogen Laser</A></h3>

The VSL-337i is a small N2 laser similar to the NL-100, above, but is
intended for incorporation into a piece of equipment and thus does not
have all the bells and whistles of the NL-100.  This laser came before
the NL-100, which is physically compatible with it.  However, since the
NL-100 has some additional features, it can replace the VSL-337i, but
not necessarily vice-versa.  And the internal construction is somewhat
different so parts are not interchangeable.  Here are three photos
courtesy of Dave Jenkins (www.dmanufacturing.com), who also contributed
to the description below:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="sp337-li.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model VSL-337i Nitrogen Laser -
 Left side</A>.  The HV power supply and trigger modules are fully enclosed
 with standard AMP connectors to the plasma cartridge.  In the background is
 the cover with fiber coupler still attached.
<p>
<li><A HREF="sp337-ri.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model VSL-337i Nitrogen Laser -
 Right Side</A>.  Hmmmm.  Not much of interest on the exposed PCB besides a
 fuse. :-)  The rear panel also has much less than that of the SRS NL-100,
 above - only the same strange power connector with no alternative, the trigger
 input BNC, and a Power LED.
<p>
<li><A HREF="sp337-pc.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model VSL-337i Nitrogen Laser Plasma
 Cartridge</A>.  While similar in size to the SRS version, these are not
 interchangeable.
</ul>
<p>
The VSL-337i is just a bare bones laser requiring 24 VDC and a
trigger pulse such as from a 555 timer to operate.  The power
supply is enabled when the laser is powered so it just needs a
positive trigger pulse to the TRIG BNC.  The Power supply hisses
briefly when power is first applied.  Although the maximum spec'd
pulse rate is 20 Hz, it will apparently go to over 30 Hz, at least
briefly, but no guarantees on survival above 20 Hz and your mileage may vary!
:)  The NL-100 is more elegant and is a lab type configuration with its
safety interlock key and speed control with an on/off switch and adjustable
trigger rate.  Plus the NL-100 can be operated in the "Auto Charge
Mode" or the "Command Charge Mode" through the DB9 cable which adds a
real nice touch since the HV power supply only turns on when triggered
with a negative pulse.

<h2>N2 Laser Humor and Other Tid-Bits</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cn2cnlh0">HeHeHeHe! N2 Lasers Have All the Fun!</A></h3>

For some inexplicable reason, the N2 laser seems to attract more humorous
discussion than other single type.  The next few sections provide a few
examples.  (See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilhu">Laser Humor</A> for
additional more general laughs.)

<h3><A NAME="cn2cnlh1">Just What You Always Wanted!</A></h3>

The following 'for sale' ad appeared on the USENET newsgroup:
<A HREF="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</A>.  Of course, we now know that these
specifications are nothing to write home about!  I am afraid that it is
probably gone by now anyhow - to the dumpster if nowhere else!

Subject:      1 MW N2 laser for sale $1 per pound.<br>
Date:         08/25/97
<p>
I have this mondo 1 MW peak N2 laser that weighs in at 1,200 pounds.  It is in
plug-and-play condition complete with documentation.  All you need is a source
of nitrogen.  I have a dewer and bought some LN2 and used the boil off to run
the laser.  Most impressive!!  It made everything that was even remotely
fluorescent in my garage glow intensely.  I had planned to use it to pump some
fluorescent plastic for a down converter to coherent visible light but I have
lost momentum and want my garage back.
<p>
I want to sell the laser for $1,200.  I can supply copies of the manual and
photographs to anyone that is interested.  It has a rather small vacuum pump
that will allow 5-10 Hz rep rate but it can sustain a much higher repetition
rate with a larger vacuum pump.  The laser was manufactured my Molectron and
is a model UV1000.

<h3><A NAME="cn2cnlh2">Nitrogen Laser Construction on a Shoestring</A></h3>

Check out:
<A HREF="http://bob.bob.bofh.org/~robm/manual/DIY-LASER.html">Build your
own Nitrogen Laser - A D.I.Y home guide</A>.  OK, perhaps this belongs
in the humor section. :)
But the general approach might almost sort of possibly on a good day have
actually worked after a fashion assuming you didn't kill yourself or
burn down the house first. :-)  There are
just a few missing details but (with a bit of interpolation) the result would
not be all much different (in spirit, at least) than the basic structure of
the typical home-built nitrogen laser we have been discussing.  Compare this
description with any of the photos shown in the section:
<A HREF="lasercn2.htm#cn2cn22">Some Photos of Home-Built N2 Lasers</A>.
<p>
Even if you aren't into D.I.Y. N2 laser building, the other

of his Web site are good for a few chuckles. :)

<h3><A NAME="cn2cnlh3">The Ultimate Nitrogen Laser</A></h3>

This one should be taken with even more of a grain of salt (or laser crystal
fragment) than the utility drawer N2 laser described above.  Also note that,
high temperature band saw material notwithstanding, you only get one shot from a
given set of apparatus so this should be figured into your budget. :-)
Also keep in mind that your Manager may not be convinced of the chances of
getting this to work from Mother Nature (without the benefit of prior testing,
quality assurance, and all required paperwork and departmental design reviews).
Therefore, you should make sure to address these concerns in your project
proposal and multimedia presentation as well.
<p>
Serious note (sort of): Aside from the obvious danger involved in obtaining the
needed power supply, this is not likely to work in any case.  Due to the self
limiting behavior of the nitrogen laser emission characteristics, the electrical
discharge would need to be precisely timed to travel along the laser tube at
roughly the speed of light as in the normal Blumlein power supply rather than
simply blowing a modest size crater in a one location.  The required Lightning
Bolt Control board (RISC microprocessor based, of course) would be one of the
many major challenges of this design.
<p>
(Portions from: Brian (LOGICWIZ@prodigy.net).)
<p>
I have an idea for building a Gigajoule laser out of simple materials. The
power source might seem outlandish at first but very viable in the end. This
laser would be based upon the nitrogen laser. It would be constructed out of
a glass or PVC pipe 4 inches x 100 feet evacuated to 25 Torr filled with
nitrogen gas from probably LN or a decomposition reaction and the electrodes
will be made out of band saw material (because it stands heat real well). The
laser would be operated in a thunderstorm.  You already know how to attract
lightning using wires attached to rockets. I estimate its power to be equal to
about 14.8 Gigajoules based on the charge and voltage of your typical lightning
bolt and the expected (very precisely computer) efficiency of a nitrogen laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>LBC = One standard Lighting Bolt Charge: 10,000 Coulombs.
<li>LBV = One standard Lighting Bolt Noltage: 200,000,000 Volts.
<li>NLE = Nitrogen Laser Efficiency: .00074 (.074 percent).
</ul>
<p>
Then, output energy will be: LBC * LBV * NLE = 14.8 Gigajoules.  If anybody is
foolish enough to try this just imagine what you could do with that burst of
power ionize the upper layer of atmosphere and create a blackout or pump a dye
laser and drill yourself a hole in a mountain. DON'T think about all of the fun
you would have with this and DO think about the real possibility of being fried
to a crisp.

Go to <A HREF="http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/">Lateral Science</A> and
take the link
<A HREF="http://www.lateralscience.co.uk/VicN2/vicN2.html">Victorian Nitrogen
Laser</A>.  The article is certainly written in a tongue-and-cheek manner
but could pass for a serious letter from an age gone by.  It had me fooled
for awhile until some of the stated observations didn't add up and of course,
there was no real reference.  However, this is totally fictional humor and
very amusing.  Much other interesting stuff on that Web site as well.
<p>
Of course, it's quite possible that lasing in air or other gases was produced
way before the invention of the laser.  However, a discovery requires both
the effect and the observation (if not the explanation).  Prior to 1960 or
so, the idea of lasing was unknown so no one knew what to even look for and
wouldn't have realized they had it.  There's little doubt that with all
the electrical experiments of the era, some inadvertent lasing took place at
some time and some place but it went unnoticed. :)
