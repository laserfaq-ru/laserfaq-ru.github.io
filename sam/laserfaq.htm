<h1>Foreword</h1>

Sam's Laser FAQ evolved to become what it is today from a short note on safely
powering low power laser diodes which I had written around 1996 in conjunction
with the CD player repair guide (part of the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ).
Those laser diodes were usually ripped from dead CD players - this was before
pocket laser pointers could be found in cereal boxes. :)  (If you're really
curious, that short note and a couple of other early versions of Sam's Laser
FAQ can be found at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/slfarchv/">Sam's
Laser FAQ Archive</A>, typos and all.)  Chapters were added as I acquired a
variety of lasers and related equipment.  Thus, much of this information
comes from first-hand experience.  First those little laser diodes and driver
circuits, then helium-neon lasers and power supplies, followed by argon ion
lasers, Nd:YAG lasers, DPSS lasers, and who knows what else the future will
bring.
<p>
However, many others have contributed in one form or another (newsgroup
postings, email, laser parts, etc.).  They are cited in the
<A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqack">Acknowledgements</A> and/or in the individual
sections which contain their material.  And, by the way, the
name: "Sam's Laser FAQ" was more or less created by those who have read
and commented on it via the newsgroups or direct email.  The name stuck in
part because the original one: LASERS: Safety, Info, Links, Parts, Types,
Drive, Construction" was just way too long. :)
<p>
While I had kept in touch with laser technology since their invention in the
early 1960s, my direct contact with lasers was relatively limited until much
more recently.  Although there was the glass working I did for someone else's
home-built HeNe laser, the ruby laser I inherited at my high school because no
one else wanted it, and the little commercial HeNe laser there used to view
the hologram in an issue of Scientific American, I was not yet really hooked
on lasers.
<p>
In fact, the first real lasers that I actually owned were purchased from a
surplus outfit in 1990 or so - a couple of small helium-neon laser tubes and
power supplies.  I only bought those because a friend of mine had casually
mentioned that I didn't have any lasers.  I couldn't let that statement stand
without doing something!  Well, after mounting, wiring (which wasn't much),
and testing them, I thought to myself: Well, these are kind of cool and might
even come in handy someday.  (My friend quickly lost interest once he realized
they weren't powerful enough to burn anything!)  I dragged them out every so
often to make sure they still worked but that was about it, laser-wise, for
awhile.
<p>
Then a few years later, having spent a lot of time on the USENET newsgroups
answering questions (mostly those in the sci.electronics hierarchy,
sci.optics, alt.lasers, and the like), it became clear that there was
virtually NO practical laser related information on the Web.  Even with my
somewhat limited contact with lasers, the scary thing was that it would appear
that I already had more of this sort of hands-on knowledge than was available
in cyberspace - and probably anywhere else outside the laser industry.  Sure,
the major laser manufacturers were beginning to discover the Internet for
their sales and advertising, and there were some academic and research sites
as well.  But, if what you wanted was to be able to light up a HeNe laser tube
or build a power supply for one, wire up a laser diode without blowing it out,
do anything with an argon ion laser or diode pumped solid state laser, or
(gasp!) build a laser from scratch - forget it.  There was virtually nothing
to be found on-line and only a bit more in print.  Much of what did exist (on
the Web at least) was incorrect, incomplete, dangerous, or all of the above.
(There is more history below.)
<p>
Sam's Laser FAQ is NOT an academic paper or reference work on quantum
mechanics, gas discharges, or solid state physics.  You can relax.  It is
about getting your hands into lasers safely and on a realistic budget.  There
is only a bare minimum of heavy math and only a few equations.  The dozens of
thick, expensive technical books and thousands of research papers on basic
laser science and advanced laser technology exist to handle that!  Sam's Laser
FAQ is for the experimenter, hobbyist, weekend tinkerer, and budding mad
scientist.  For you!  Enjoy. :)

While I am flattered when other people are interested in what I've
developed, everything in Sam's Laser FAQ is copyrighted material.
This includes, but may not be limited to: all text, photos, diagrams, and
schematics, as well as the look and feel.  Obfuscation of the material
by removing or adding to it, changing colors, etc., does not make it
acceptable!  The laser community is rather small so violations will
very likely be uncovered.  If you're using Sam's Laser FAQ material on
a public Web site or in an eBay auction, I will find it.  As noted in
the section above, non-commercial use of this material is permitted as
long as the source is acknowledged in an appropriate manner.  So, why
take a chance at ending up in this hall of shame for the World to see! :)
However, for-profit use is strictly prohibited without prior approval.
<p>
As of October, 2004, I know the following Web sites are using
material from Sam's Laser FAQ without permission or acknowledgement:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.lasershandbook.net/">Lasershandbook.net - Helium-Neon

 various photos from the Laser Equipment Gallery.)
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.cat.ernet.in/others/lasinfo/">Centre for Advanced

<p>
I have attempted to send email to the operators of all these Web sites.
The email either bounced or there has been no response.
<p>
If you are the Webmaster or developer of one of these Web sites,
it's simple and painless to include the necessary acknowledgements.
Please contact me via the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
I also often find text or graphics  from Sam's Laser FAQ in eBay auction
listings without acknowledgement.  This, too, is a violation of fair use.
But the requirements are even simpler and would be satisfied by adding
something like:
<p>
<PRE>
 "This material is from <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lasersam.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ</A>."
</PRE>
<p>
or
<p>
<PRE>
 "This material is from Sam's Laser FAQ which may be found at 
  http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lasersam.htm."
</PRE>
<p>
However, in general, my preference would be to simply provide a link to
the appropriate section (or sections) of Sam's Laser FAQ rather than including
an excerpt in the auction listing.
<p>
When a violation is found, I will normally attempt to contact the seller
and have them amend the auction listing but if that fails, their eBay ID
will be added to this list and further action may be taken through
eBay or legal channels.
<p>
Presently, the following eBay IDs have not acknowledged emails with reference
to copyright violations: onlinesurplus, reliabletools.
<p>
Anyone in these lists who respond and comply will have all references to
their transgressions expunged from this document.
<p>
Thanks.

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

This document is still under development and will probably continue to be in
this state until will beyond the time when the Sun turns into a red giant or
Hell freezes over, though the Engineers may be able to prevent the latter, at
least. :-)
<p>
Many of the circuits have been reverse engineered - traced from various
schematics or actual hardware.  There may be errors in transcription,
interpretation, analysis, or voltage or current values listed.  They are
provided solely as the basis for your own designs and are not guaranteed to be
'plans' that will work for your needs without some tweaking.
<p>
Many power supplies and other laser components operate at extremely lethal
voltage and current levels.  The optical output from even modest power lasers
can result in instant and irreversible damage to vision.  No one ever should
attempt to operate, troubleshoot, repair, or modify such equipment without
understanding and following ALL of the relevant safety guidelines for lasers
and high voltage and/or line connected electrical and electronic systems.
<p>
We will not be responsible for damage to equipment, your ego, county wide
power outages, spontaneously generated mini (or larger) black holes, planetary
disruptions, or personal injury or worse that may result from the use of this
material.
<p>
Note that I have no business relationship (financial or otherwise) with any
of the laser product manufacturers, sales, or service companies, referenced in
this document and benefit in no way by recommendations or suggestions to check
out their Web sites.  In addition, a requirement of any Sci.Electronics.Repair
FAQ or Sam's Laser FAQ mirror site is that there be no advertising of any kind
forced on you within the pages of these documents - even for those that are
hosted on commercial servers.
<p>
And, yes, flattery will get you everywhere but I am almost as eager to have
any feedback (good or bad), corrections, suggestions, or additions.  Please
feel free to contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.  I will make every effort to
reply, usually within less than 24 hours.  Sam's Laser FAQ has been and
continues to be a labor of love.  My only reward (aside from the occasional
dead laser or other high-tech toy that gets sent my way) is the knowledge that
someone, somewhere, is using this material and is hopefully enjoying the
fruits of my effort and making use of them in a productive way.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

While I have written a good portion of Sam's Laser FAQ from my first-hand
knowledge and experiences, information from many other sources has been
invaluable in filling gaps and even constructing some of the foundations.
Much of this has been from postings to USENET newsgroup and other discussion
groups, as well as via private email.  Wherever possible, I have acknowledged
these individual contributions.  However, if you feel that there is something
here you wrote without being recognized, please send me mail via the

<h2>More on My Background and What I Do for a Real Job</h2>

I am an electrical engineer by profession.  I have spent significant time
in both academia and industry teaching and designing in the areas of the
architecture and implementation of digital systems.  The development of one
particular special purpose high performance image and graphics processor with
three of my students led to the creation of a business plan.  I have done the
startup thing, been taken over by a big company, spent some time there, and
become bored with corporate life.
<p>
As with many large companies, upper management was behaving in classic Dilbert
style, with chronic and terminal foot-in-rear-end disease.  They were thus
incapable of appreciating the need for the next generation system that would
have been zillions of times better in every respect than what was being sold
and could have maintained the company's leadership position in high
performance three-dimensional visualization.
<p>
While my official title had a "Technical Director" in it, I had little to
direct, technically or otherwise!  So, out of boredom, I turned to the then
still somewhat novel means of communication, the Internet.  (Yes, I know,
the Internet goes back to the 1970s but Mosaic, the predecessor of Netscape,
was kind of new in 1994.)  I discovered USENET newsgroups, in particular, the
sci.electronics hierarchy including sci.electronics.repair; alt.home.repair
and misc.consumers.house; and alt.lasers.  I initially gravitated to the
repair newsgroups because I had always been interested in repair of almost
anything mechanical and electronic.
<p>
During the next few years, I replied to literally 10s of thousands of questions
on electronics and electronics repair, as well as some on lasers - check them
out by searching on <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</A>.
At some point, Filip "I'll buy a vowel" Gieszczykiewicz (filipg@repairfaq.org)
contacted me via email and asked if I'd like to upload some of my material
to his Web site which hosted the original Sci.Electronics FAQ.  Thus were born
what are now the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQs including the "Notes on the
Troubleshooting and Repair of..." series and other documents on electronics.
(Fil still hosts our main S.E.R FAQ site at
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/">repairfaq.org</A>.)
<p>
As noted in the <A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqfor">Foreword</A>, while replying to
a few questions on lasers, it became obvious that there wasn't much reliable
information on practical aspects of lasers on the Internet (the Web and
newsgroups).  CD players and CDROM drives contained laser
diodes so the first laser document to be written was one on the care and
feeding of laser diodes removed from CD players.  When questions were posted
on Helium-Neon (HeNe) lasers, I dug up my surplus lasers and answered as best
as I could - which was still usually better than what others could provide
(though given what I know now, probably not much better!).  Sam's Laser FAQ
really took off when I was given a bunch of HeNe laser heads and power
supplies - several of which I could reverse engineer.  And the rest, as they
say, is history! :)
<p>
I officially quit the corporate World in 1996 and during the next few years
devoted the bulk of my time to developing the S.E.R FAQ in general, but
mostly - and increasingly - specifically Sam's Laser FAQ.  I was also an
independent engineering consultant, accepting the occasional contract job
if I thought it would be technically fun and rewarding and paid at least
enough to make any hassles tolerable.
<p>
Near the end of 2000, I began working at Drexel University (Philadelphia,
PA) as a Research Professor in the
<A HREF="http://www.ece.drexel.edu/CMLE/">Center for Microwave and Lightwave
Engineering (CMLE)</A>, in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
Department.  I had done my undergraduate work at Drexel during a time long
long ago and contacted their alumni relations department in search of some
server space to mirror the S.E.R FAQ.  During a meeting to discuss the matter,
I casually asked if anyone was doing anything with lasers.  They introduced me
to of all people, the professor who amazingly had been my academic adviser
from back then and he even remembered me!  As it turned out, there was a need
for someone with practical laser experience.  I hadn't intended to get a real
job but after taking some time to think it through, the idea of being back in
academia had a certain appeal and I decided to give it a shot.  So, now I
do real laser work in a university setting.  Should you care, the research
involves high performance mode-locked and chirped solid state microchip lasers
for millimeter wave communications, lidar/radar, and biomedical imaging.
There are some papers at the CMLE Web site (which I just happen to maintain
as well) with much more information.
<p>
Since this is not a tenure track faculty position, I don't have to teach
classes, attend faculty meetings, deal with academic politics, or have 
quite the pressure to publish or perish.  I've been down that road and am
not eager to repeat it.  However, I have a couple of very talented graduate
students and although I don't really own them, we make a great team with
their theoretical knowledge complementing my practical experience.  And, they
are really impressed when I produce any sort of visible laser (especially
green ones) from my pocket (everything we do at CMLE so far is in the
infra-red).  The only down-side was that since Research Professor is actually
a staff (not a faculty) position, my status ranked somewhere between that of a
garden slug and slime dwelling worm in the university hierarchy. :)  In
fact, as of the Summer of 2005, I am simply a consultant to Drexel and the
CMLE group, no longer being officially on the staff.
<p>
In addition to the Drexel work, I continue to do the occasional engineering
consulting (same criteria for acceptance of jobs apply - there has to be a
fun factor involved!).  But enhancement of Sam's Laser FAQ still represents
a major portion of my efforts.  I expect this to continue for the foreseeable
future.

<h2>Sam's Laser Lab and Lasers</A></h2>

It would be nice if I had a lab setup like the one I outline in the chapter:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#contoc">Amateur Laser Construction</A>.  However, so
far, that isn't the case.  My laser projects have shared
space with old VCRs and parts storage, the laundry area, woodworking tools,
and just random junk.  I have cleared out the photo equipment from my (former)
darkroom to make way for lasers.  (Who does wet photography anymore?  I
even recycled parts of my home-built enlarging timer: its relays went into
a home-built argon ion laser power supply and its aluminum box is now the
chassis for a lab style HeNe laser power supply.)  But even with this
extra space, the general appearance is more like the aftermath of a hurricane
than something one might call <i>orderly</i>.  However, the dead VCRs have
fnally been evicted. :)
<p>
I currently own a variety of lasers including numerous HeNe laser tubes,
heads, and complete lasers (including other colors than red) from very
small to fairly large, and commercial and home-built power supplies; and
several air-cooled argon ion laser heads, my home-built power supply, and
a still-in-need-of-reassembly Omni-150.  I have countless laser diodes and
a few complete modules, pulsed Nd:YAG heads with a home-built power supply,
a high power CW Nd:YAG head in need of a new arc lamp (and a small miracle
which will probably never happen), several DPSS green lasers (both commercial
and home-built), and external mirror HeNe lasers using tubes with one and
two Brewster windows mounted in home-built resonators (including
a nifty one-Brewster tube that does green!).  My oldest commercial laser is a
Spectra-Physics model 130B HeNe laser built like a tank which has a manual
dated 1966 (though I don't know if my actual sample is quite that old.
Best of all, after a bit of tender loving care, it actually still lases.
I do not know of any other working 130B lasers in the explored Universe.
The next oldest is an American Optical 3100 HeNe laser - also the only
known working sample of this laser still in existence.  I power up both
these lasers daily at least for a few seconds to show I still care about
them.  This appears to be the attention they desire and performance
continues to be unchanged, even after several years for the 130B.
<p>
Most of the more interesting lasers are described in one form or another
somewhere in this document.  Wavelengths for the lasers I have so far include:
325 nm, 337.1 nm, 400 nm, 405 nm, 457 nm, 458 mm. 488 nm, 514.5 nm, 532 nm,
543.5 nm, 568 nm, 594.1 nm, 604.6 nm, 611.9 nm, 632.8 nm, 635 nm, 640 nm, 647
nm, 658 nm, 670 nm, 694.3 nm, 780 nm, 808 nm, 830 nm, 870 nm, 980 nm,
1,064 nm, 1,321 nm, 1,523.1 nm, and 10,600 nm.  If you don't recognize all (or
any!) of these wavelengths now, you will by the time you have read
through Sam's Laser FAQ!  And, if you are at all curious, my favorite
wavelength is 594.1 nm, which is something along the lines of
traffic-light yellow. :)
<p>
Many of these lasers and laser related equipment have been given to me
by various generous people as a sort of reimbursement for the vast amount of
free information I have provided on-line - both in Sam's Laser FAQ and the
other documents on consumer electronics repair and general electronics
information (all part of the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ) and from my numerous
contributions to the various USENET newsgroups including alt.lasers,
sci.optics, sci.electronics.repair, and other technical forums (over 30,000
postings to date, most being replies to requests for assistance in various
areas).  I also buy occasional junk lasers on eBay or mail order but some of
the most interesting ones have been sent to me in response to my request for
such toys. :)  (See the section: <A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqpds">Please Don't
Scrap Your Unwanted or Broken Lasers or Laser Related Equipment and
Parts!</A>.)
<p>
At some point in the future I do plan to construct some truly home-built
lasers, probably starting with the more unusual ones outlined in the chapter:
<A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgtoc">Home-Built Pulsed Multiple Gas (PMG) Laser</A>.
I have a several vacuum pumps and gauges, and neon sign transformers, and a
wide variety of suitable electronic components, but still need to put together
a proper gas delivery system and acquire the required special gases.  If only
politicians generated more than hot air. :)  Oh, and to find the time!

<h2>Please Don't Scrap Your Unwanted or Broken Lasers or Laser Related
 Equipment and Parts!</h2>

I am interested in obtaining lasers and laser parts of all types and sizes
in almost any condition (dead, partially dead, broken, in need of alignment,
adjustment, or repair, etc.) including but not limited to: diode laser modules
(even laser pointers, especially green ones), laser diodes, and laser diode
drivers; HeNe, Ar/Kr ion, CO2 or other laser tubes, power supplies, and power
supply components; flashlamp, arc lamp, and diode pumped solid state (DPSS)
lasers, laser crystals (Nd:YAG, Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, KTP, etc.), and other
solid state laser parts; optics and accessories; modulators, deflectors, and
sensors; other types of power and control circuits; and almost anything else
related to lasers.  Of particular interest are DPSS lasers and components in
almost any condition including (but not limited to): Coherent Compass 532
and 215M/315M/415M lasers and controllers; Uniphase uGreen, Melles Griot
high power DPSS (e.g., 58-GLS/GSS/GLD/GSD up to 3 W green or
58-BLS/BSS/BLD/BSD up to 400 mW blue) or similar; or any IR, green,
blue, red, yellow, etc., DPSS lasers from other manufacturers.  I
wouldn't object to a 10 W Coherent Verdi in mint condition. :)
<p>
Obviously I would love to get working units as well but since this effort is
primarily for non-profit use to expand knowledge and further enhance the FAQ,
all I can really pay is slug mail shipping and maybe a wee bit more for
something of sufficient entertainment value (mine). :-)
<p>
Any information found during my dissection or repairs would eventually
find its way into this continually evolving document.  While I rarely sell
anything that I have revived or restored (how could I part with such things?!)
if I were to do so with any items obtained via this request, I would be happy
to share any net proceeds with the contributor.
<p>
In addition to hardware, schematics for laser diode drivers, HeNe, Ar/Kr ion,
and other laser power supplies, as well as other laser related circuits are
also of particular interest.  Where permitted, these would be added to the FAQ
and/or made available at the Web sites (i.e., they are not proprietary or in
violation of copyright restrictions if made public).
<p>
Also see the "Wanted to Acquire" sections of
<a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/sale/">Sam's Classified Page</A>
for other laser as well as non-laser (mostly high vacuum and high voltage)
parts, equipment, gadgets, and assorted tid-bits I'm interested in obtaining.
<p>
So, please send me (Sam) mail via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ

your basement, garage, or attic, and really need the space. :)

<h2>Request for Computer Resources in Support of Sam's Laser FAQ Development</h2>

Most of the text/html content for the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ and Sam's
Laser FAQ is developed in emacs on a unix system via telnet/ssh.
While some people may consider such an arrangement archaic, this allows for
rapid creation and editing, accessibility to the original files from anywhere
in the Universe via an Internet connection, less need to upload or download
files to my PC, and professionally managed system maintenance, upgrades, and
backup.
<p>
I currently have access to accounts at the University of Pennsylvania
(UPenn) and Drexel University which I use to create, edit, and test
the material in the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ and Sam's Laser FAQ.
The primary account I use for FAQ development is at UPenn and this
seems to be secure for the moment the situation can change from one
year to the next.  The Drexel computer is probably
reliable as far as a long term relationship but for some reason,
USENET access is limited and posting doesn't seem to work at all.
<p>
Therefore, I am looking for access to 1 or 2 additional unix or linux
systems, preferably at academic institutions like colleges or
universities, but I will also consider other types of not-for-profit
organizations.  For obvious reasons, I really do not want to do this in
association with anything commercial. My needs are modest: 1 GB of
disk space, telnet or ssh, ftp or sftp, emacs/gnus read/post,
muttmail, and publicly accessible Web space.  Most of what I do is
editing and email so processing requirements are modest and shouldn't
impact other activities.  However, a reliable supported environment is
critical to my sanity so your personal server farm isn't something of
much interest. :)
<p>
I do not want and will not accept monetary contributions for this effort.
But, a way to help the FAQ development would be to provide stable
computer access.  If you know of, or are able to offer such a resource,
please contact me via the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair
FAQ Email Links Page.</A>  In return, of course, you get a local copy of
the absolutely latest and greatest versions of the FAQs (and space
permitting), all the associated ancillary material.  And, of course,
priority email replies to technical questions!  Thank you! :)

<h2>Scope and Purpose of This Document</h2>

Many types of lasers are used in conjunction with popular hobbyist projects,
basement experimentation, and just plain old late night tinkering.  Diode and
helium-neon (HeNe) lasers in particular are very common due to several factors
including the wide availability of inexpensive components and systems (new and
surplus) and the relative ease of constructing working devices.  A greater
number of argon (and krypton) ion lasers are turning up on the surplus
market at very affordable prices as they are replaced with more modern
solid state alternatives like green diode pumped solid state lasers.  But
even some of those are now becoming available at prices that while not
exactly low, are well within the reach of a dedicated hobbyist.  There is
often interest in carbon dioxide lasers because of their higher power
capability.  And, of course, ruby and YAG lasers for their higher pulsed
power.
<p>
However, on-line and print resources with detailed information on driving
laser diodes and powering helium-neon lasers seem to be scarce.  Some of
those that do exist are incorrect and potentially dangerous (or at least
destructive).  There appears to be virtually nothing at all on argon/krypton
ion, CO2, solid state, and other lasers.  And, even less on the nitty-gritty
of amateur laser construction.
<p>
This document was written in the hopes of rectifying this situation.
<p>
Contributions in almost any form are always welcome and will be acknowledged
appropriately.
<p>
However, note that there is, and never will be, more than passing mention of
laser weapons in Sam's Laser FAQ.  This is <b>NOT</b> the place to go to learn
about such things.  If that's your main interest, you'll have to look
elsewhere, sorry.

<h2>Organization of This Document</h2>

For the most part, we assume that you are at least familiar with the basic
concept of what a laser is and have an idea of your intended application
(but reading though this document may help) - be it for optics experimentation,
communications, ranging, simple curiosity, or just being able to say you have
a working laser in the house. :-)
<p>
<b>PART I</b> includes some general information on lasers and laser related
topics.  In addition to essential laser safety information, there are general
items of interest, discussions of a variety of laser instruments and
applications, and a list of suggested laser and laser based experiments and
projects.
<p>
There isn't much in the way of laser physics and other theoretical topics.
(You can now breathe a sigh of relief!)  Nor will there be extensive treatment
of the design of laser shows, holography experiments, interferometers, or
the like - though some ideas are provided just to stimulate your interest.
I leave these to the many excellent books and articles that have been
published over the years.
<p>
Our major emphasis is on the practical aspects of common lasers (including
diode, HeNe, argon/krypton ion, CO2, HeCd, and diode and lamp pumped solid
state) that may be found outside of a well funded research lab - those
available at reasonable cost on the used or surplus market, for example.
<p>
<b>PART II</b> provides access to the rest of the World in terms of laser
information, and laser and parts manufacturers, sales, and service.  (I would
include the rest of the Universe but my interstellar network is still in beta
testing.)  There are extensive lists of references and Web links to laser
safety sites, tutorials on lasers and laser related topics, and laser and
optics organizations and manufacturers.
<p>
If you are interested in detailed information on all types of lasers, laser
applications, laser physics, laser experiments, or laser research, consult the
chapter: <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirtoc">Laser Information Resources</A> for a
list of books, magazine articles, and Web links covering everything laser
related from basic questions like "What is a laser" or "How do lasers work" to
"Spectra in stimulated emission of rare gases" and "Dissociative excitation
transfer and laser oscillation in RF discharges" - and everything in between.
A quick check of some of the educational Web sites may provide everything you
need.
<p>
The chapter <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A> includes
pointers to sources for everything from $2 laser diodes to $100,000 CO2 laser
based machining centers - new, used, surplus, and salvage.
<p>
<b>PART III</b> deals with the care and feeding of lasers constructed from
commercial components like helium-neon tubes and laser diodes.  There is
also extensive information on the design and construction of power supply,
driver, and other circuits.
<p>
The chapters on specific types of lasers includes at least *10* circuits for
driving laser diodes, *20* complete schematics for helium-neon laser power
supplies, as well as simple modulators and other useful goodies.  Most of
these have been tested and/or came from working commercial designs and can be
built using readily available inexpensive parts.
<p>
The material on argon/krypton ion lasers includes extensive information on the
general characteristics and features, power supply requirements and design
considerations including circuit descriptions, and maintenance and alignment
of these highly prized devices.  There are several complete ion laser power
schematics of varying levels of sophistication which can be replicated using
readily available parts or used as the basis for a custom design of your own!
<p>
There is also coverage of CO2 lasers (including a discussion of sealed CO2
tubes which are powered in a very similar way to helium-neon lasers) as well
as some basic info on HeCd lasers.
<p>
Solid state lasers are now dealt with in considerable detail along with
complete schematics for ruby and Nd:YAG power supplies.
<p>
To the best of my knowledge, no other resource in the explored universe (or
elsewhere) currently comes close to providing as much practical information on
these topics in a form which is both easy to read and readily accessible in
one place - if at all.
<p>
<b>PART IV</b> is for the true basement experimenter and provides information
on actually constructing entire lasers from basic materials like beach sand and
copper ore. :-)  Well, maybe not quite that basic but: glass tubing, mirrors,
hardware, gases, chemicals, and electronic components like transformers,
resistors, capacitors, and diodes - and laser safety and high voltage warning
signs!
<p>
Where you really think constructing a laser from scratch would be a challenge,
fun, and educational, first keep in mind that such an endeavor is generally a
LOT of work and depending on the type of laser, may require access to fairly
sophisticated facilities and equipment (at least compared to the average
kitchen sink - and that, too, may be needed!).  These may include the need for
glass blowing, a high vacuum system, access to a machine shop, and sources for
assorted lab supplies, chemicals, pure gases, and specialized optical and
electronic components.  This is not to say that your dream is unrealistic or
impossible - just that one must be quite determined to see such a project
through to a successful conclusion and the information in this document will
get you started.

<p>
There are many other documents at the
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/">Sci.Electronics.Repair (S.E.R) FAQ</A> Web
site or one of its mirror sites which may be of use in the design, testing, and
repair of laser equipment.  The
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/REPAIR/">Main Table of Contents (ToC)</A>
provides links to a variety of information on troubleshooting and repair of
many types of equipment, general electronics, an assortment of schematics,
over 1,000 technology links, and much more.  Most of these documents are nicely
formatted, indexed, and cross-referenced.  (<A HREF="faqsam.htm">Silicon Sam's
Technology Resource</A>, which may be present at this site and others, usually
contains more recent versions of many of these same documents some of
those (particularly the large repair guides) under the S.E.R FAQ Main ToC are
easier to use and the actual content differences are likely to be minor.)
<p>
The first document below is also part of Sam's Laser FAQ itself. It is also
the most important:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered
  Equipment</A> should be thoroughly studied before even thinking about working
  on any of the power supplies for gas or solid state lasers.  (At least with
  small diode lasers, about all you can easily do is destroy the laser diode
  itself.)
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/cdfaq.htm">Notes on the
  Troubleshooting and Repair of Compact Disc Players and CDROM Drives</A>
  provides more info on how the laser diodes in CD players and CDROM drives
  worked originally.
<p>
  Where the manufacturer and part number for your laser diode are known, by all
  means take advantage of the extensive applications information that is likely
  to be available.  Start with a search of "Laser Diode Scout" at
  <A HREF="http://www.thorlabs.com/">ThorLabs</A>.  Driving laser diodes
  without blowing them out is often not easy - even for an experienced design
  engineer!

<h2>A Brief Introduction to Lasers Principles and Structure</h2>
<h3><A NAME="faqilp0">The Laser Age</A></h3>

Since every document on lasers must have a discussion of basic principles,
this is it!  If you know anything at all about lasers, you can skip to the
section: <A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqccl">Characteristics of Some Common
Lasers</A> since the summary below will probably just put you to sleep and
then you might miss the rest of the excitement. :-)  If you want a more
in-depth on-line course, see the section:
<A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqoli">On-Line Introductions to Lasers</A>.
<p>
A laser is a source of light but unlike anything that had ever been seen or
implemented before 1960 when Theodore H. Maiman of Hughes Aircraft mounted a
specially prepared synthetic ruby rod inside a powerful flash lamp similar to
the type used for high speed photography.  (If you're into reading heavy
scientific literature, the reference is: T. H. Maiman, "Stimulated Optical
Radiation in Ruby", Nature, 6 Aug. 1960, vol. 187, no. 4736, pgs. 493-4.)
When his flash lamp was activated, an intense pulse of red light burst forth
from the end of the rod that was both monochromatic (a single color) and
coherent (all of the waves were precisely in step).  The difference between
the output of a laser and that of an incandescent light bulb is like the
difference between white noise and a pure tone.
<p>
The laser age was born.  Within a very short time, in addition to many more
solid state materials, laser action was demonstrated in gases (the ubiquitous
helium-neon laser was the first gas laser though it originally only produced
invisible IR wavelengths), liquids, and semiconductor crystals.  Almost every
conceivable material was tried in the frenzy to produce new and interesting
lasers.  Even some varieties of Jello(tm) brand dessert were blasted with
xenon light, and according to this legend, are supposed to work fairly well.
I wonder whether the flavors have to be all natural. :-)  (See the section:
<A HREF="lasercdy.htm#cdycdye">Comments on the Jello Laser Legend</A> for a
discussion on this very exciting topic.)
<p>
See <A HREF="http://laserstars.org/history/">Laser Stars - LASER
HISTORY (1917-1996)</A> for an interesting chronology of laser development,
discovery, and applications.
<p>
Although the first working laser was built at Hughes Aircraft, much of the
early theoretical and practical work was done at Bell Labs - work which
continues till the present day.  See
<A HREF="http://www.bell-labs.com/history/laser/">The Invention of the Laser
at Bell Labs: 1958 - 1998</A>.  Quoting from this site:
<blockquote>
"The invention of the laser, which stands for light amplification by
 stimulated emission of radiation, can be dated to 1958 with the publication of
 the scientific paper, Infrared and Optical Masers, by Arthur L.  Schawlow,
 then a Bell Labs researcher, and Charles H.  Townes, a consultant to Bell
 Labs. That paper, published in Physical Review, the journal of the American
 Physical Society, launched a new scientific field and opened the door to a
 multibillion-dollar industry."
</blockquote>
<p>
In many ways, the laser was a solution looking for a problem.  Well, the
problems soon followed in huge numbers.  It would be hard to imagine the
modern world without lasers - used in everything from CD players and laser
printers, fiber-optic and free-space communications, industrial cutting and
welding, medical and surgical treatment, holography and light shows, basic
scientific investigation in dozens of fields, industrial cutting and welding,
and fusion power and Star Wars weapons research.  The unique characterisics
of laser light - monochromicity (the light is very nearly a single wavelength
or color), coherence (all the waves are in step), and directionality (the beam
is either well collimated to start or can easily be collimated or otherwise
manipulated) make these and numerous other applications possible.  In fact, it
is safe to say that the vast majority of laser applications have not yet even
been contemplated.  For an idea of the extensive and diversified applications
for which the laser has become an essential tool or component, see for example:
<A HREF="http://perg.phys.ksu.edu/vqm/laserweb/Apps/Ap_frm.htm">Rami
Arieli - The Laser Adventure: Laser Applications</A>.

<h3><A NAME="faqilp1">General Physical Characteristics of Lasers</A></h3>

The word 'LASER' is an acronym standing for 'Light Amplification by Stimulated
Emission of Radiation'.  (Note that while strictly speaking, all letters
should be capitalized since it is an acronym, this is not generally done now
that lasers are so common.)  In some ways, this is somewhat confusing since
most lasers are actually oscillators (generators or sources of light) and not
amplifiers (devices for increasing the strength of a signal), though such
lasers are also possible and used for some applications.  However, I suppose
proposing the alternative of "Light Oscillation by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation" or LOSER would result in a severe career limiting experience.
"Hey boss, I just invented the LOSER."  "Yeah, well, YOU'RE FIRED!" ;-)
<p>
The output of a laser can be pulsed or a continuous beam; visible, IR, or UV;
with power ranging from less than a milliwatt to millions of watts.  However,
nearly all lasers have the following in common:
<p>
<ol>
<li>A lasing medium.  This can be a solid, liquid, gas, or semiconductor
 material which can be pumped to a higher energy state.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>It must be possible to boost a majority of the lasing medium to an upper
   energy level (electron, ion, vibrational) called a population inversion.
<p>
 <li>There must be a downward transition triggerable by stimulated emission.
<p>
 <li>Most lasers are based on 3 or 4 (energy) level systems.  Which of
   these are possible depends on the lasing medium:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>3 level:</b> Example: Pump from level 1 (ground state) to level
  3 which decays rapidly to level (2).  Stimulated emission takes place
  from level 2 to level 1.  This type of a 3 level systems must be
  run pulsed since it is an <i>absorber</i> of its own lasing wavelength
  when in the ground state.  The self absorption behavior would make it
  virtually impossible to maintain the population inversion required for
  continuous wave (CW) operation.  In addition, such a lasing medium must
  be fully pumped (not just part of its length) since the unexcited region
  would then tend to block the laser light resulting in an increased
  lasing threshold and loss of efficiency.  The ruby laser is such a 3
  level system.  (Another type would have the stimulated emission from
  level 3 to level 2 with rapid decay to level 1.)
<p>
 <li><b>4 level:</b> Example: Pump from level 1 (ground state) to level
  4 which decays rapidly to level 3.  Stimulated emission takes place
  from level 3 to level 2 which then decays to level 1.  Such a 4
  level system may also be run continuous wave (CW) if the lifetime in
  level 2 is short enough.  The helium-neon laser is a 4 level system
  but one where the laser (stimulated) transition takes place between
  level 4 and level 3.  Level 3 then decays rapidly to level 2
  and then to level 1 via collisions with the tube walls.
<p>
 <li>The intuitively simpler 2 level system does not work well in
  practice since it is difficult to produce a population inversion.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li>A means of pumping energy into the lasing medium.  This can be optical,
 electrical, mechanical (though I don't know of any mechanically pumped
 lasers off-hand!), chemical, etc.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Gas lasers use an AC or DC electrical discharge through the gas medium,
  or external RF excitation, electron beam bombardment, or a chemical
  reaction.  Other pumping means are also possible.  The DC electrical
  discharge is most common for 'small' gas lasers (e.g., helium-neon, argon
  ion, etc.).  But pumping by means of an energetic chemical reaction is
  also possible.  (See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioichl">Chemical
  Lasers</A>.)
<p>
 <li>Solid state lasers usually use optical pumping from high energy xenon
  flash lamps (e.g., ruby, Nd:YAG) or from a second pump laser or laser
  diode array (e.g., DPSS frequency doubled green lasers).  Continuous
  solar or xenon arc pumping may be used for some types of lasers.
<p>
 <li>Semiconductor lasers are most often pumped by DC current but optical and
  electron beam pumping may also be possible.
<p>
 <li>Liquid (dye) lasers are usually pumped optically.
<p>
 <li>X-ray lasers have supposedly been pumped using small nuclear devices.
  Although tests may have been performed (underground), there is
  controversy as to whether they were successful.  (There may be smaller
  X-ray lasers today that use other pumping means and don't self destruct
  with every shot.)  See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioixrl">X-Ray
  Lasers</A>.
<p>
 <li>Free Electron Lasers (FELs) are 'pumped' by multimillion (or
  multibillion) dollar particle accelerators.  These 'lasers' are not
  constructed along the same lines as the other types.
  For more information, see the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioifel">Free
  Electron Lasers</A>.
</ul>
<p>
<li>A resonator.  In most cases this is some form of a Fabry-Perot cavity, a
 pair of mirrors, one at each end of the laser, which allow stimulated light
 to bounce back and forth through the lasing medium.  Usually, one of the
 mirrors is totally reflective while the other is partially transparent to
 allow the laser beam to escape.  The mirrors are either perfectly flat
 (plane) or one or both may be very slightly concave.  Other configurations
 are possible:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Some lasers have a mirror at one end only (e.g., nitrogen laser) or no
  mirrors at all (e.g., X-ray laser since it is nearly impossible to
  reflect electromagnetic radiation at X-ray wavelengths).
<p>
 <li>Lasers constructed in the shape of a triangle or rectangle (mirrors at
  the corners) may have no output beam but use interference from a pair of
  counter-rotating laser beams at one location internally to sense the
  assembly's orientation in a ring laser gyro platform.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liarlg">Ring laser gyros</A>.
<p>
 <li>Optical slabs are often used in high power laser amplifiers.  In one
  common configuration, the slab is oriented at the Brewster angle (see the
  section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioibrw">What is a Brewster Window?</A>) so
  that virtually no energy is lost due to reflections from its surfaces as
  the beam passes through.  Slabs may also be configured in such a way that
  the laser beam follows a zig-zag path through the slab reflecting back and
  forth from its flat faces.  In both cases, the large surface area of the slab
  means that it is able to dissipate a large amount of power without
  damage.  The largest pulsed lasers in the world (used for inertial fusion
  and nuclear bomb research) employ slab type laser amplifiers extensively.
<p>
  See: <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National
  Laboratory</A> for more information.  Search for "lasers".
<p>
 <li>Lasers may be constructed with 'distributed feedback' which replaces one
  of the mirrors with a diffraction grating.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioidfb">Difference Between Fabry-Perot and DFB
  Lasers</A>.  Adjusting the angle of the grating can be used to select the
  wavelength of the output in some lasers.  (An 'intra-cavity' prism can
  also be used for this purpose.)
<p>
 <li>Additional optical elements like prisms, modulators, Q-switches, Kerr
  cells, and so forth may also be present inside the resonator.
 </ul>

<h3><A NAME="faqilp2">Basic Laser Operation</A></h3>

Relax!  This will be short and simple.  There are numerous references with
extensive information - at all levels of sophistication - on laser theory.
See the chapter: <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirtoc">Laser Information Resources</A>
for references and links to all sorts of material which will cure insomnia. :-)
<p>
We present only the briefest of summaries.  Some additional more specific
material is presented in the chapters: <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoc">Helium-Neon Lasers</A> and <A HREF="laserdio.htm#diotoc">Diode Lasers</A>.
<p>
Please refer to the diagram: <A HREF="laserop.gif">Basic Laser Operation</A>
whlle reading the following explanation.  The numbers in () denote each step
in the lasing process.
<p>
Normally, nearly all atoms, ions, or molecules (depending on the particular
laser) of the lasing medium are at their lowest energy level or 'ground state'
(1).
<p>
To produce laser action, the energy pumping device must achieve a population
inversion in the lasing medium so that there are a majority of atoms/ions/or
molecules at the upper energy level of the pair that participates in the
stimulated emission.  Note that those designated 'Energy Level 2' in the
diagram are the ones of interest; some have also been raised to 'Energy
Level 1' and just sit there taking up space (2). :-)
<p>
At random times, some of these excited atoms/ions/molecules will decay to the
lower energy state on their own.  In the process each one emits a single photon
of light in a random direction.  This is called 'spontaneous emission' and by
itself isn't terribly useful.  It is basically the same process that accounts
for the glow of a neon sign, or the phosphor coating of a fluorescent lamp or
screen of a CRT (3).
<p>
However, Einstein showed that if one of these photons happens to encounter an
excited atom/ion/molecule in just the right way, it will drop down to a lower
energy state and emit a photon with several amazing properties compared to the
original one.  Among these are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The new photon will be of exactly the same wavelength.
<li>The new photon will have exactly the same phase.
<li>The new photon will be emitted in exactly the same direction.
</ul>
<p>
The new photon will have exactly the same polarization as well, though this is
not a requirement to create a laser.  However, where the resonator favors a
particular polarization orientation (e.g., there is a Brewster angle window or
plate in the beam path or the cavity is highly asymmetric), or in some cases,
there is a particular magnetic field configuration, the output beam will also
be polarized - but this is for the advanced course. :-)
<p>
So, imagine the lasing medium (perhaps, it is easiest to visualize it like
the glowing gas in a neon sign) spontaneously emitting these photons in all
direction at random times.  Most will be lost exiting the side of the
discharge tube or hitting one of the mirrors at an angle and then escaping its
confines.
<p>
Occasionally, however, a photon will happen to be emitted nearly parallel to
the long direction of the resonator (3,4).  In this case it will travel down to
one of the mirrors and be able to bounce back and forth many times (with some
configuration of slightly concave mirrors, if there were no losses, it could
even do this indefinitely).  So far, pretty boring!  However, along the way,
it encounters excited atoms/ions/molecules and STIMULATES them to give up
their photons.  As this progresses, what was once a single photon is now an
avalanche of more and more photons via this stimulated emission process
(3,4,5).
<p>
The resulting beam is highly monochromatic (nearly entirely one wavelength)
and coherent (all the waves are in-step).  It is also either well collimated
(nearly parallel rays for most lasers including gas and solid state types) or
appears to originate from a point source (diode lasers).  In either case,
the beam can easily be manipulated in ways impossible with more common light
sources.
<p>
If the pumping source is adequate and enough atoms/ions/molecules are being
raised to the upper energy level to maintain the population inversion while
this is happening, the laser action will continue indefinitely (barring
trivial problems like overheating or depletion of the power available on the
National Electric Grid).  This results in a continuous wave laser.  If the
pumping cannot be maintained or some energy levels get clogged up, the result
is a pulsed laser.  (Therefore, <A HREF="laserop.gif">Basic Laser Operation</A>
actually illustrates a pulsed laser since pumping is not sustained.)
<p>
There you have it!  Everything else is just details. :-)
<p>
For some (still easy to understand) details on the principles of operation of
the ubiquitous helium-neon laser, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoo">Theory of Operation, Modes, Coherence Length,
On-Line Course</A> as well as the chapters on other specific types of lasers.

<h2>On-Line Introductions to Lasers</h2>

There are a number of Web sites with laser information and tutorials.  Many
are of marginal value at best.  However, there are a few that stand out as
being well worth bookmarking:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The best that I have found by far was the
 <A HREF="http://www.cord.org/">CORD</A> Laser/Electro-Optics
 Technology Series, Cord
 Communications, 324 Kelly Drive, P.O. Box 21206, Waco, Texas 76702-1206.
 This was essentially a complete textbook with hundreds of diagrams,
 many basic equations (you can't have everything!), detailed laboratory
 experiments, and extensive lists of references for further study.
<p>
 There were several (mostly complete) courses (some are still under development
 and there were a few rough edges).  While the original material was developed
 in the early 1970s (there were a number of diagrams with tube circuits!), it
 has been updated and had a lot to offer including by far the most complete
 on-line presentation of laser technology (e.g., resonator structures and power
 supply example schematics) that I know of - though not to the level of detail
 present in Sam's Laser FAQ! :)
<p>
 The blurb that went along with the courses states:
<blockquote>
 "The LEOT (Laser/Electro-Optics Technology) curriculum was developed by
  CORD in 1970-1974 with funding from the U.S. Office of Education. At that
  time many books on lasers were available for physicists and engineers.
  Those books contained the rigorous theoretical information needed to develop
  new designs and applications for lasers. The LEOT curriculum does not
  provide that kind of information, but instead, is written for the technicians
  who will build, modify, install, operate, troubleshoot, and repair lasers.  
<p>
  Technicians are a vital link in the advancement of photonics technology. They
  are the workers in the laboratories, plants, and fields who ensure that
  lasers, and other photonics related equipment, operate properly and
  reliably."
</blockquote>
<p>
 So these course were very practical in nature and provide a nice companion to
 Sam's Laser FAQ's practical orientation.
<p>
 Unfortunately, as of Summer, 2001, links to these courses from the
 CORD homepage have been removed supposedly due to the expiration of their
 funding.  While the courses are available for purchase in
 print form, It's a pity that this has happened.  Print is not the same as
 on-line, even if it were free.
<p>
 Hope you saved whatever you wanted from my copy that used to be on-line.
 Awhile ago, CORD had actually approved of my making a mirror site available
 with the LEOT materials, though they didn't offer to help in any way
 (like provide a zip or tar copy of everything).  I was even on their
 LEOT email distribution list at one point.  Then, lobotomized bean
 counters must have gotten involved and they had their legal department
 send threatening emails to anyone who they found to have copies of
 their Web pages on-line.
<p>
 But now (April, 2008), large portions seem to be back at
 <A HREF="http://cord.org/cm/new/viewleot.htm">Index to LEOT Course
 Material</A>.
 Given the past history, don't expect it
 to be stable or remain for long.  Entering from
 <A HREF="http://cord.org/cm/">CORD: Curriculum Morphing Project</A>,
 which one might think should be more reliable, seems
 to go to an older incomplete table of contents.

 This was all great educational content for those who wish to gain a better
 understanding of the principles of laser operation, find out what is in a
 laser, see examples of power supply circuits, and much more.  But, it is
 designed at a level that shouldn't put you to sleep with too much heavy
 math. :-)
<p>
 The good news is that a new set of courses are under development.
 Some links include:

 <li><A HREF="http://www.cordonline.net/laserapplets/">Applets for

</ul>
<p>
 These links will no doubt decay fairly quickly but a Web search should be
 able to locate where they went. :)
<p>
 The organization of topics is as follows:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Module 1: Nature and Properties of Light
 <li>Module 2: Light Sources and Laser Safety
 <li>Module 3: Basic Geometrical Optics

 summaries of laser types, applications, and laboratory experiments is:
 <A HREF="http://perg.phys.ksu.edu/vqm/laserweb/">The Laser Adventure</A>

<h2>Characteristics of Some Common Lasers</h2>

Here is a summary of the features, power output, power supply requirements,
wavelengths, beam quality, cost, and applications of diode, helium-neon,
argon/krypton ion, carbon dioxide lasers, helium-cadmium, and solid state
lasers.  There are many many other types but these represent the most
common lasers available over the last 50 years - the the most common lasers
available on the surplus market today.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Diode lasers.  Semiconductor laser diode 'chip' driven by low voltage power
 supply.  Optical feedback from a monitor photodiode (commonly in the same
 package as the laser diode) is generally used for precise regulation of
 laser diode current.
<p>
 Wavelengths: Red (635 nm, actually may appear slightly orange-red) through
 deep Red (670 nm) and beyond, IR (780 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm, 1,550 nm, etc.) up
 to several um).  Near-UV, violet, and blue laser diodes are available from
 around 380 nm to 450 nm but are still very expensive.  Green laser diodes
 have been produced in various research labs but until recently, only
 operated at liquid nitrogen temperatures, had very limited lifespans
 (~100 hours or worse), or both.
<p>
 Beam quality: Fair to high depending on design.  The raw beam is elliptical
 or wedge shaped and astigmatic.   Correction requires additional optics
 (internal or external).  Coherence length anywhere from a few mm to many
 meters.
<p>
 Output power: 0.1 mW to 5 mW (most common), up to 100 W or more available.
 The highest power units are composed of arrays of laser diodes, not a single
 device and may exceed 100,000 W.
<p>
 Some applications: CD/DVD players and CDROM/DVDROM drives, LaserDisc,
 MiniDisc, other optical storage drives; laser printers and laser fax
 machines; laser pointers; sighting and alignment scopes; measurement
 equipment; high speed fiber optic and free space communication systems;
 pump source for other lasers; bar code and UPC scanners; high performance
 imagers and typesetters, small (mostly) light shows; medical treatment
 (ophthalmic, uninary, and others).
<p>
 High power laser diodes are the enabling technology for high efficiency
 Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) lasers and future energy efficient lighting.
<p>
 Cost: $1 to $10,000 or more.
<p>
 Comments: Inexpensive, low (input) power, very compact, but critical drive
 requirements.  Many types of diode lasers are not suitable for holography or
 interferometry where a high degree of coherence and stability are required.
 However, see the section: <A HREF="laserdio.htm#dioint">Interferometers
 Using Inexpensive Laser Diodes</A> since these common CD player and visible
 laser diodes may in fact be much better than is generally assumed.  In
 addition, it has been reported that some inexpensive diode lasers appear to
 be even superior to traditional helium-neon lasers costing $Ks for
 holography.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liahol4">Holography Using Cheap Diode Lasers</A>.
<p>
<li>Helium-Neon (HeNe) lasers.  Most common are sealed HeNe plasma tube with
 internal mirrors, high voltage power supply.  External mirror HeNe lab
 lasers also available and expensive.
<p>
 Wavelengths: Red (632.8 nm, actual appearance is actually orange-red) is
 most common by far.  Orange (611.9), yellow (594.1 nm), green (543.5 nm),
 and IR (1,523.1 nm) HeNe lasers are also readily available (but these are
 less efficient and therefore more costly for the same beam power).
<p>
 Beam quality: Extremely high.  The output is well collimated without
 external optics and has excellent coherence length (10 cm to several meters
 or more) and monochromicity.  Most small tubes operate with a single
 spatial/transverse mode (TEM00).
<p>
 Output power: 0.5 to 35 mW (most common), up to 250 mW or more available.
<p>
 Some applications: Industrial alignment and measurement; blood cell counting
 and analysis); medical positioning and surgical sighting (for higher power
 lasers); high resolution printing, scanning, and digitization; bar code and
 UPC scanners, interferometric metrology and velocimetry; non-contact
 measuring and monitoring; general optics and holography; small to medium
 size light shows, laser pointers (very rare noawadays but still
 sort of available), LaserDisc and optical data storage (obsolete, 
 replaced by laser diodes).
<p>
 Cost: $25 to $5,000 or more depending on size, quality, new or surplus.
<p>
 Comments: Inexpensive, components widely available, robust, long life.
<p>
<li>Argon (Ar) and krypton (Kr) ion lasers.  These differ mainly in gas fill.
 Sealed plasma tube with internal or external mirrors and high current (10
 amps or more at around 100 VDC for the smallest; 50 A at 400 VDC for
 larger ones) regulated power supply (constant current
 or optical power based).  Combined Ar/Kr produces lines in red, green, and
 blue, and is therefore considered a 'white light laser'.  All are electrical
 power guzzlers and larger units are water cooled.
<p>
 Wavelengths: Argon ion - Violet-blue (457.9 nm), blue (488 nm - single line),
 green (514.5 nm); Krypton ion - Green (521 and 532 nm), yellow (568 nm), red
 (647 nm).  Other wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum (and beyond) are
 available (but generally weaker) and may be 'dialed up' on some models.
 Mixed gas (Ar/Kr) ion lasers (sometimes called "whitelight" lasers) may
 produce a combination of both sets of wavelengths.
<p>
 Output power: 10 mW to 10 W.  Research lasers up to 100 W.
<p>
 Beam quality: High to very high.  Single mode (TEM00) and multimode types
 available.
<p>
 Some applications: Very high performance printing, copying, typesetting,
 photoplotting, and image generation; forensic medicine, general and
 ophthalmic surgery; entertainment; holography; electrooptics research;
 spectroscopy and other chemical and physics research; and as an optical
 'pumping' source for other lasers.
<p>
 Cost: $500 (surplus 100 mW) to $50,000 (multi-watt new) or more.
<p>
 Comments: High performance for someone who is truly serious about either
 optics experiments like holography or medium to high power light shows.
<p>
<li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers.  Sealed (small) or flowing gas design.  High
 voltage DC, RF, electron beam or other power supply.
<p>
 Wavelength: Mid-IR.  10.6 um (10,600 nm) is by far the most common but
 9.6 um and several other wavelengths are also possible.
<p>
 Beam quality: High.
<p>
 Output power: A few watts to 100 kW or more.
<p>
 Some applications: Industrial metal cutting, welding, heat treatment and
 annealing; marking of plastics, wood, and composites, and other materials
 processing, and medicine including surgery.
<p>
 Cost: New systems go for several $K to 100s of $K depending on specific
 type and output power.  Used/surplus low to moderate power (up to 100 W)
 flowing gas systems may be available for under $500.
<p>
<li>Helium-Cadmium (HeCd) lasers.  Sealed HeCd plasma tube with internal
 mirrors, high voltage power supply, and control system.  Systems are more
 complex than other common gas lasers due to the need for control of cadmium
 vapor pressure and overall temperature/pressure.  Actual discharge power
 requirements are in between HeNe and ion lasers - 1 to 2 kV at around
 100 mA.  
<p>
 Wavelengths: Violet-blue (442 nm) and ultra-violet (325 nm) depending on the
 optics.
<p>
 Beam quality: Very high.  HeCd lasers usually use sealed narrow bore plasma
 tubes and operate in TEM00 mode.
<p>
 Output power: 10s to 100s of mW.
<p>
 Some applications: Non-destructive testing and spectroscopy.
<p>
 Cost: High initial cost (many $K) due to low production volume and greater
 plasma tube and power supply/control system complexity.  Older systems may
 be available for under $100 but almost always need tube replacement or
 regassing.
<p>
 Comments: Less common than HeNe, Ar/Kr ion, and CO2 types.  Few uses for
 the hobbyist except for the challenge value.
<p>
<li>Solid State Lasers.  Rod, slab, or disk of crystal or amorphous material
 usually pumped optically by flashlamps or arc lamps, or
 high power laser diodes or arrays of laser diodes.  Doped optical fiber
 pumped with high power laser diodes may also be gain medium.  The output
 may be pulsed, CW, or quasi-CW, depending on design and application.
<p>
 Wavelengths: Near-IR (most common are Nd doped materials, around 1,064 nm) to
 visible (ruby at 694.1 nm), many other materials are now being developed.
 Output may be frequency multiplied to yield a visible (532 nm) or UV (355 or
 266 nm) beam.
<p>
 Output power: Varies widely.  Peak in the PetaWatt range (for large
 research lasers), average up to 1,000 W or more.  Q-switching provides
 extremely high peak power in a short pulse.
<p>
 Beam quality: Low to high.
<p>
 Some applications: Materials processing (drilling, cutting, welding,
 trimming), green (532 nm) laser pointers and other visible lasers replacing
 argon ion types, inertial confinement fusion and nuclear bomb research,
 laser entertainment, laser rangefinders, laser weapons, target designation,
 medical/surgical, spectroscopy, study of very short pulse phenomena, study
 of matter, and many many others.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="faqtls">The Largest and Smallest Lasers</A></h3>

Since you were about to ask:

<ul>
<li>By far the largest pulsed solid state laser on the face of the earth (at
 least for awhile) will be at the
 <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/nif/">National Ignition
 Facility</A> being constructed at <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence
 Livermore National Laboratory</A>.  It will produce about 1.8 MJ per pulse
 with a peak output power of over 500 Terawatts.  The NIF laser will be about
 the size of a football STADIUM with 192 beam lines and over 7,300 major
 optical components including some 3,000 Nd:Glass slab amplifiers nearly a
 meter across!  Its estimated construction cost is more than $1,200,000,000
 with an annual operating budget of about $60,000,000.  No, the NIF laser isn't
 portable.  And, while its output could in principle be redirected to vaporize
 mosquitoes, the 192 beam lines presently converge on a microscopic
 point to implode D-T pellets for fusion research. :-)
<p>
<li>The largest CW laser is probably one of the following CO2 lasers:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>A CO2 laser at the Troisk Institute for Thermonuclear Research (in
  Troisk, about 80 miles outside of Moscow, Russia) is claimed to
  be a 10 <b>MegaWatt</b> laser.  This is perhaps a slight exaggeration,
  but not by much.  It is truly a CW laser though and would run for as long as
  power and cooling were supplied.  I don't know the exact size of the laser
  but the room it is in rivaled that of the NOVA laser.
<p>
 <li>A CO2 laser at the Institute of Physics, Savanoriu 231, LT-2053, Vilnius,
  Lithuania.  This laser was so powerful that it had a dedicated electrical
  power line coming directly from power station.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>The smallest lasers in common use are diode lasers like those found in
 CD players, barcode scanners, and telecommunications equipment.  The active
 region is a fraction of a millimeter long and as little as 1 x 3 micrometer
 in width and height.  The entire semiconductor chip is about the size of a
 grain of sand.  Even smaller 'microlasers' have been developed and some are
 in commercial production.  In principle, a single atom can be the active
 medium in a laser.
</ul>

<h2>Lasers for the Hobbyist and Experimenter</h2>
<h3><A NAME="faqwgil">Why Do People Get Into Lasers?</A></h3>

If you are reading this material because you are already a laser nut, skip
this section - you already know how you got hooked.  For someone who has
stumbled upon Sam's Laser FAQ and is wondering why anyone would be interested
in such an apparently esoteric topic - or whose only previous contact with
lasers has been to tease their pet cat with a laser pointer, here are a few
reasons (besides being able to talk about a topic that 99.99% of the World's
people haven't a clue about!):
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser technology:</b> - Lasers use all sorts of interesting
 electronics, optics, and mechanics.  Much of this involves complex circuits,
 high quality mirrors, precision structures, and other high tech toys.  Skills
 needed to deal with laser design, adjustment, testing, and repair may include
 high voltage electronics to vacuum systems and gas handling; pulsed high
 energy discharge circuits; stable DC or RF current or voltage sources,
 drivers, and modulators; structural components like optics mounts and
 resonators; and much more.  A working laser is a study in technological
 beauty.  This is my main interest. :)
<p>
<li><b>Laser applications:</b> - There are literally 10s of thousands of
 uses for lasers using devices ranging from the microscopic laser diode in a CD
 or DVD player to huge industrial carbon dioxide lasers for cutting, welding,
 and other large scale materials processing.  However, the most common
 application of lasers for fun would be to create the dynamically changing
 patterns and graphics of a laser light shows using a combination of
 helium-neon, argon and krypton ion, arc lamp or diode pumped solid state, and
 diode lasers, along with modulators and deflectors.
<p>
<li><b>Laser research:</b> - The laser is a wonderfully sophisticated but
 in many ways, elegantly simple device that makes use of the fundamental
 principles of quantum mechanics.  There are vast uncharted waters to be
 explored (no, this is not about sailboats!) in creating new and more advanced
 types of lasers and systems using lasers.  While the typical experimenter
 and hobbyist isn't likely to have access to the types of facilities and
 equipment to discover anything fundamentally new, they can keep up with
 much of the developments through trade magazines and scientific literature.
</ul>
<p>
If you are now thinking: "I'd probably enjoy bamboo under the fingernails or
root canal therapy more than any of this", perhaps lasers aren't for you. ;)
However, if anything you have read so far seems fascinating or <i>really
way cool</i>, then continue on.  It doesn't take a lot of money to get into
lasers ($10 will get you a laser and a simple laser show can be put together
for under $25 - though it is quite possible to end up spending many $1,000s
even on used or surplus lasers and laser related equipment!) but it does take a
driving interest and the ability and willingness to construct and tinker.  If
you are incapable of changing a light bulb without the instruction manual,
perhaps lasers aren't for you either.  Lasers are also not the sort of thing
where you are likely to find many other people in your immediate neighborhood
sharing your passion except in a few places - mostly near laser manufacturers
or research installations.  So, be prepared to do most of your interaction via
the Internet and other long distance correspondence.  There are few laser clubs
and no laser trading cards (but trading of laser equipment is quite popular)!
<p>
Having said all that, doing almost anything successfully with lasers can be
very rewarding and if you haven't decided on a career, could give you a head
start in the photonics area - the merging of lasers, optics, and electronics -
which is one of the key technologies of today and the future.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
If you are still in high school, and you REALLY want to get into lasers your
choices for college would be University of Rochester, followed by a coin
flip decision between University of Arizona or University of Central
Florida.  Also there are numerous other schools with some optics courses
and laser research.

<h3><A NAME="faqlhe0">Commercial Lasers Versus Amateur Laser
 Construction</A></h3>

Diode, helium-neon (HeNe), argon/krypton (Ar/Kr) ion, and Diode Pumped Solid
State (DPSS) lasers are probably the most popular types of lasers generally
available to hobbyists and experimenter (see the section:
<A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqccl">Characteristics
of Some Common Lasers</A>).  This is due to the wide availability of complete
lasers and laser components (new as well as surplus), and their desirable
optical and physical characteristics, including the generation (in most cases)
of a continuous beam, manageable power and cooling requirements, and the fact
that there is no need for sophisticated laboratory facilities to keep them
healthy.  A major portion of this document is devoted to the practical aspects
of these types of laser systems, their power sources, and related optics and
electronics.
<p>
Of these, I still consider the HeNe laser to be the quintessential laser:
An electrically excited gas between a pair of mirrors.  It is also the ideal
first laser for the experimenter and hobbyist.  OK, well, maybe after you get
over the excitement of your first laser pointer! :)  HeNe's are simple in
principle though complex to manufacture, the beam quality is excellent -
better than anything else available at a similar price.  When properly powered
and reasonable precautions are taken, they are relatively safe if the power
output is under 5 mW.  And such a laser can be easily used for many
applications.  With a bare HeNe laser tube, you can even look inside
while it is in operation and see what is going on.  Well, OK, with just a
wee bit of imagination! :)  This really isn't possible with diode or solid
state lasers.
<p>
While many other types of lasers may be acquired or constructed including:
mercury vapor ion, nitrogen, excimer, dye, ruby, Nd/YAG, chemical, free
electron, and X-ray, most of these are less commonly available as surplus.
There could also be problems obtaining the 100 million volt particle
accelerator required for the free electron laser and the small thermonuclear
device needed to pump the X-ray laser. :-)
<p>
Now, back down to earth....
<p>
Where you are really interested in actually constructing any of these types of
lasers from basic materials (e.g., not by simply hooking together commercial
laser tubes and power supplies), check out the chapters beginning with:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#contoc">Amateur Laser Construction</A> which include
general information on the types and requirements for home-built lasers,
setting up a laser lab, introduction to vacuum systems and glass working,
and other really exciting topics.

<h3><A NAME="faqlhe1">General Comments on Lasers as a Hobby</A></h3>

(From: Richard Alexander (RAlexan290@gnn.com).)
<p>
How much do you like to build things? Would you prefer to assemble a bunch of
parts, or do you want to blow your own glass tubes, too?  Do you have any
mechanical experience? Do you build electronic kits? Keep in mind that you
will often be working with intense light (enough to instantly damage your
unprotected eyes, and maybe your unprotected skin) and high voltages.
<p>
All laser experimenters (and optics types, too) should have a copy of 
"Scientific American"'s "Light and Its Uses." [5] It gives construction plans
for a Helium-Neon (you blow the glass tube yourself), an argon ion (even more
complicated), a CO2 (designed and built by a high school student, and able to
cut through metal), a dye, a nitrogen (a great first laser, but watch out for
UV light) and a diode laser (obviously, you buy the diode laser and assemble
the driver circuit from the plans they supply). They also explain how to make
holograms using visible and infrared light, microwaves and sound. There are
other projects, too. The book is getting fairly old (the HeNe dates to the
'60s), but it's still a great reference.
<p>
A nitrogen laser may be built for under $200 (maybe less than half that amount
if you are lucky). It requires no mirror alignment (since it has no mirrors).
The technology for building this laser was available to Ben Franklin, so there
is nothing too critical in it. The hazards it presents are lots of ultraviolet
light (spark discharges and laser beam), high voltage (necessary to arc across
a 1/4 inch spark gap in a nitrogen environment) and circuit etcher (the main
capacitor is made from an etched circuit board).
<p>
Once built, the nitrogen laser can drive many other projects. It can be used
as a pump for the dye laser, for example. It will light up anything
fluorescent. It is a pulse laser (10 ns) that can be repetitively pulsed (120
Hz is a likely frequency). Megawatt power is possible, but the total energy is
low (due to the short pulses).
<p>
Helium-Neon laser tubes may be bought from many mail-order companies. I bought
one from Meredith Instruments in Arizona. They cost about $15, and the power
supply can be built or bought for about another $20. You have the option of
buying tubes with mirrors attached or not. You might want to buy the mirrors
attached, because aligning those mirrors is extremely tedious. I was given an
"A" for constructing a working Helium-Neon laser from the parts in the Laser
Lab in less than an hour. The class was given two semesters to gain the
experience they needed to do that.
<p>
If you want more than one color from lasers, there are various ways to do it,
but none of them are as nice as one might like. For $3,000 or so, you can buy a
Helium-Neon laser that will produce laser light ranging from infra-red to
green.  All you have to do is turn a dial on the back.  But it's very low
power (a few mW) and not really very useful to the hobbyiest except as an
expensive conversation piece. :)
<p>
Laser light shows usually use argon ion or krypton lasers and/or arc lamp or
diode pumped solid state laser.  The ion lasers are able to produce most of
the colors of visible light, and some can also be dialed to the desired color.
The solid state lasers are most often green but other colors are becoming
available.  However, professional quality laser systems usually cost many
thousand dollars ($40,000 is not too unusual) and require either forced
air or water cooling or a combination.
<p>
A dye laser is the usual solution to the multi-color problem. They are
inexpensive and simple. They aren't especially tunable, unless you change the
dye, although a diffraction grating can be used to tune a particular dye to
various colors. One common dye that can be used in a dye laser is the green
dye found in radiator antifreeze.

<h3><A NAME="faqdbsl">Database of Equipment Containing Interesting
 Lasers</A></h3>

We all know that CD, DVD, MiniDisc, LaserDisc, and other optical storage
devices; barcode scanners, laser printers, laser pointers, and so forth,
contain lasers but all sorts of other equipment does as well.  And, some
of those lasers may be nice and large and powerful.  Each of the respective
chapters on particular types of lasers has information on their common
uses and in some cases, specific models of equipment where they may be found
(mostly argon ion).
<p>
Mike Harrison (mike@whitewing.co.uk) has a Web page in the early stages of
development which lists graphic arts, industrial, medical, scientific, and
other equipment which include internal lasers of all kinds.  The page can
be updated with your contributions as well.  Take the link near the bottom
of <A HREF="http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/">Mike's Electric
Stuff Page</A> (which also has a lot of other interesting topics).
