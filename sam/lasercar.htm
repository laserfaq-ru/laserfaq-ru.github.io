<h2>Basic Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="carcar0">Introduction to Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser</A></h3>

Although very similar in basic design to the home-built HeNe laser, in some
ways, the Ar/Kr ion may be easier to construct and operate since pure argon,
krypton, or a mixture may be used for the lasing medium and the quality of
the vacuum system may be slightly less critical (though the better the vacuum,
the longer the tube will operate between regassing - but this is a simple
process).  The power supply is a bit more complex but not by much given the
existence of modern solid state high voltage rectifiers.
<p>
Output wavelengths can be 488.1 nm (blue) and 514.5 nm (green) using argon
and 647 nm (red) using krypton.  Other colors may be possible.
<p>
There are some brief comments by Syl Newmann, the author of the original
SciAm article on the pulsed argon ion laser in the section:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#conpwhb">Experiences of People Who Have Built Lasers
From Scratch</A>.

<h3><A NAME="carsaf">Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are two areas of safety considerations for the home-built Ar/Kr ion
laser (and other similar lasers, for that matter):
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built Ar/Kr ion laser may be capable of
 producing a beam with an average power of several mW at multiple wavelengths.
 Since there doesn't seem to be any hard information on the actual power
 obtainable with this or similar home-built laser designs, it is important to
 take precautions assuming a higher power until determined otherwise.  And,
 the peak power could be in the WATTs range.
<p>
 Avoid eye contact with the direct or reflected beam.  This includes the 4
 pairs of beams reflecting off the Brewster windows which may be quite strong.
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supplies can be lethal.  Neon sign transformer
 based power supplies have enough voltage and current to stop a heart,  Even
 if you aren't killed, the shock may startle you into doing something you might
 regret.  Make sure you read and follow the <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety
 Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment</A>.  Insulate all
 connections and install barriers to prevent contact with the high voltage.
</ul>
Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argiak5">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser
Safety</A> for more info.  However, the pulsed home-built ion laser uses a
different sort of power supply than CW commercial types (unless you are
attempting something similar to one of these) so some of the details may
not apply,)
<p>
For more information, see the chapter: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser
Safety</A> and the more specific information in the section:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argiak5">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Safety</A>.  Sample safety
labels which can be edited for this laser can be found in the section:

<li>The only on-line resources for totally home-built Ar/Kr ion lasers I know
 of is at:
 <A HREF="http://www.pulslaser.de/">Puls Laser (German)</A>.  This Web site
 has virtually all of the home-built laser types including
 CO2, N2 (including TEA), ion, ruby, dye, and some that aren't covered here.
 It includes descriptions, photos, references, and other
 information.  An English translation would be most welcome as Altavista
 does less than a stellar job and doesn't follow the frame links.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.amazing1.com/">Information Unlimited</A>
 plans for a pulsed argon ion laser which is nearly identical to the one in
 Scientific American.  They do go into somewhat more detail with respect to
 the vacuum system including a possible implementation using series connected
 refrigeration compressors instead of a real vacuum pump.  Despite the
 similarities, the somewhat more detailed instructions in these plans
 (compared to the SciAm article), the availability of the electronic parts
 (from Information Unlimited), and the list of suggested companies to
 purchase the mechanical parts, may make them beneficial to someone who isn't
 enthusiastic about scrounging, designing, or improvising, and would rather
 take more of a cookbook approach to home-built lasers.
 <A HREF="http://www.mwklasers.com/">MWK Laser Products</A> has plans
 for the pulsed argon/krypton ion laser as well which I assume are similar
 but don't know for sure.

<h3><A NAME="carcar2">Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser Description</A></h3>

Like the HeNe laser the Ar/Kr ion laser is one of the simpler gas lasers in
existence, it is probably in the middle of the range of difficulty of
home-built lasers discussed in this document and "Light and its Uses", perhaps
a tad on the easier side.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="ar1asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Argon Ion Laser Assembly</A>
for a simplified diagram of the overall glasswork and power supply electronics.
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall - M to H.
  <li>Glass work - M.
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work) - M.
  <li>Vacuum/gas handling - M.
  <li>Power supply - M.
  <li>Additional apparatus (optical mirror alignment jig) - M.
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - Argon: 488.0 nm (blue), 514.5 nm (green).  Krypton:
  647 nm (red).  Other colors may be possible depending on tube length, mirror
  reflectivity, actual gas fill, and to what extent other losses are minimized.
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium - Low pressure argon or krypton or a mixture.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter - 2 mm; bore length - 50 cm.
<p>
  <li>Total tube length (includes additional space beyond the actual bore,
    e.g., to the center of the Brewster windows) - 70 cm.
<p>
  <li>Tube material - Borosilicate (Pyrex) glass.
<p>
  <li>Electrodes - Cold cathode type using neon sign electrodes.  These are
    mounted in side-side-arms.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill - Argon and/or krypton at a fraction of a Torr to a few Torr (not
    stated).
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air.  Increased cooling would permit a much higher
    duty cycle and greater optical power output.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Fused quartz windows, Brewster angle = 35.8 degrees from
    axis.  The portions of the tube including Brewster windows are attached
    via glass ball-and-socket joints to permit fine tuning of Brewster angle
    and window orientation.
<p>
  <li>Mirrors - HR: Dielectric, concave, RoC = 120 cm; OC: Dielectric, planar.
    Three screw <A HREF="mmount1.gif">Adjustable Mirror Mount</A> at each end.
    Reflectivity not stated for either mirror.  Alignment technique not stated
    - can use any of the techniques from this document or "Light and its Uses".
<p>
    One source for mirrors might be a surplus commercial ion laser head like
    the ALC-60X that uses an external mirror tube (see the chapter:
    <A HREF=laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>).  Or, obtain a
    replacement set of optics for such a head.  Typical cost: $150.  Note:
    You would need to make sure f for any concave mirror is large enough since
    the resonator in this home-built laser is much longer than that in the
    typical small air-cooled ion laser head.  OK, so maybe the optics for a
    Lexel-88 instead. :)
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length (mirror face to mirror face) - 85 cm.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Requirements - Medium.  Article calls for 10<sup>-2</sup> Torr but
    with a suggestion that a better vacuum would extend tube life.
<p>
  <li>Sealed tube operation but limited life (perhaps 1/2 hour) before
    regassing is required (but this is fairly easy).
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required - Fuming nitric acid to clean laser tube
  glass parts before evacuation/baking/backfill.
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - Electrical discharge.
<p>
  <li>Power supply - 5,000 VRMS, 30 mA neon sign transformer and Variac with
    full wave rectifier and 1 uF, 5 kV capacitor.  Triggering via external
    aluminum foil electrode wrapped around bore using Oudin coil.  The
    spectral lines in the optical output will depend on power supply current
    to the tube.

    Triggering could be done using any of the pulse type HeNe starting
    circuits described in the chapter: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdtoc">HeNe
    Laser Power Supply Design</A> but as above using the external electrode
    rather than a direct connection to the tube anode.  Any similar xenon
    strobe trigger should also work.

<h3><A NAME="carguide">Guidelines to Assure a Successful Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion
 Laser</A></h3>

These set of guidelines should be followed during construction of your first
home-built pulsed ion laser.  The factors below will greatly influence the
ultimate output power, beam quality, and whether it produces any coherent
light at all!  Once you have a working laser, feel free to make
modifications - one at a time.  Thanks to George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com)
for his comments.

<ul>
<li>Use the proper diameter thick wall capillary and assure that it is
 straight.  A smaller diameter than used in the SciAm pulsed ion laser may
 be beneficial, say between 1 and 1.5 mm.  This will both increase the gain
 (which is inversely proportional to bore diameter) as well as help to assure
 a TEM00 beam profile.  A larger bore will tend to operate with multiple
 longitudinal modes (which you may find interesting as well).  Slight warp or
 sag of the capillary can be adjusted with intermediate bore supports.  Avoid
 the temptation to just use a narrow thin wall tube which would make the entire
 assembly very fragile.
<p>
 However, there are two disadvantages to using a narrow bore:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>It will result in a higher operating and starting voltage which should
  be taken into account in your power supply design.
<p>
 <li>Alignment using the card method will be more difficult.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Obtain good quality fused quartz optical flats for the Brewster windows.
 They should be at least 1 mm thick to minimize distortion from the vacuum.
 These don't have to be expensive - plenty of low cost surplus optics is
 available.  Any candidate Brewster window should pass the following tests:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>When viewed edgewise, it must <b>NOT</b> have a greenish (or other
  color) tint.
 <p>
 <li>When you hold it at arm's length and view something across the room
  through it, there should be no detectable magnification or minification.
 <p>
 <li>When viewed against a black background in a concentrated light beam (such
  as sunlight passing through an f/4 concentrating lens) it should show very
  little scattering of light (from incomplete cleaning or incomplete
  polishing).
 </ol>
<p>
 No other aspect of the laser tube assembly itself is as important as the
 quality of the Brewster windows to the ultimate outcome of this project!
 While, certain types of distortion won't prevent lasing (some may even make
 it more exciting with complex mode structures), this is a complicating
 factor your first laser can do without.
<p>
<li>The ball-and-socket construction described in the in the SciAm article
 is probably not essential but provides an adjustment range so the laser
 tube assembly is less critical.  If you don't use this approach, cut the
 ends of the laser tube to accept the Brewster windows only <i>>after</i>
 all glass working (including annealing) has been performed as these steps
 may affect the angles enough to increase losses.  Take care that
 the angle is close to the correct value for your window material (35.8
 degrees from the beam axis for fused quartz) with their perpendiculars as
 close to parallel as possible.  (An error of up to 1/2 degree is acceptable
 in both cases.  Use the /===\ arrangement, <b>not</b> /===/ (which will shift
 the optical axis).   Make sure the inside surfaces of the windows are
 immaculately clean before installation!  They can't really be cleaned
 properly once attached to the tube.
<p>
<li>Mount the electrodes in side-arms well away from and with no line-of-sight
 to the Brewster windows.  This will minimize the deposit of a metallic film
 on the Brewster windows due to sputtering (particularly at the negative
 electrode).
<p>
<li>Don't skip the essential cleaning step before final assembly of the
 Brewster windows to the laser tube.  This will greatly reduce the amount of
 bake-out required once you are under vacuum.  It will still be necessary to
 pass a high current through the tube in both directions for some time as
 well as running a low temperature torch over areas that aren't heated enough
 by the discharge.  However, the amount of outgassing and required time will
 be greatly reduced.
<p>
 CAUTION: Apparently, it is possible for an electron beam to be produced from
 the positive electrode during the high current bake-out step which can quickly
 melt a hole through the tube wall opposite the side-arm if left running for
 more than a few seconds.  The visual effect will first be a spot of bright
 yellow sodium light from the point of impact.  Use lower current and/or make
 that area of the tube (the outside of the turn) much thicker.
<p>
<li>Obtain proper laser resonator mirrors.  Sorry, you can't make these in
 your basement.  Don't even bother to try silvered or aluminized mirrors
 (e.g., from barcode scanners), at least not until you have the laser working
 with real mirrors.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The HR should have as high a reflectivity as possible and the OC should
  have about 99 percent reflectivity (assuming the 50 cm or so active bore
  length), both over the range of wavelengths of interest (at least from 488
  to 514 nm unless you only care about a single wavelength).  If your laser is
  longer, the OC reflectivity can be reduced slightly but starting with 99
  percent will work well, if not being quite optimal.  Or, if you would like
  to have beams from both ends or identical mirrors are much cheaper, they can
  both be 99.5 percent.  For initial testing, the use of a pair of HR mirrors
  will result in the lowest threshold and the highest likelihood of lasing if
  something else is marginal.  Once you see the (coherent) light, a proper OC
  can be installed.
<p>
 <li>Their Radius of Curvature (RoC) should be between L and 2*L, where L is
  the distance between mirrors.  An RoC of L will result in a confocal cavity
  which has a number of attributes including being relatively easy to align.
  An alternative which may be desirable is to implement a folded confocal
  cavity with an RoC of 2*L for the HR and infinity (planar) for the OC.
  See the sections: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioimir">Mirrors used for Lasers
  and Laser Applications</A> and <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao3">Mirrors for
  Home-Built Lasers</A> for more info.
<p>
 <li>Mirrors salvaged from commercial ion laser tubes will be satisfactory if
  their RoC and reflectivities are as described above.  Those from short tubes
  will have RoCs that are too small and won't do anything useful.  The OC from
  a long tube may have a reflectivity that is too low.  Mirrors from a
  large-frame ion laser may also be unsuitable due to insufficient reflectivity
  and their RoCs will be long making alignment more critical.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Mount everything on a stable base and make sure your mirror mounts have
 adequate precision!  No amount of fiddling will compensate for mirrors that
 change position on their own.  Yes, it may be possible to assemble a working
 laser mounted on wobbly stands but this isn't recommended!
<p>
<li>Unless you want to be faithful to the era when the first ion laser was
 built (and there were no other lasers handy), I'd recommend using a
 HeNe or collimated diode laser to perform the mirror alignment.  Mount the
 alignment laser to the baseplate so that it will be there whenever you need
 it.  Do the initial alignment once everything is assembled but <i>before</i> 
 actually evacuating the system and filling it with the argon gas.
 Then, you'll be ready to lase, or at least very close.  The card method of
 alignment can also be used but may be a bit tougher with the recommended
 narrower bore.
<p>
<li>Use spectroscopic grade argon and/or krypton gas.  The purity of the gas
 fill is extremely critical to ion laser performance.
<p>
<li>Make sure you read, understand, and follow <b>ALL</b> the safety
 guidelines found in the section: <A HREF="lasercar.htm#carsaf">Home-Built
 Ar/Kr Ion Laser Safety</A>.

<h3><A NAME="cardins">Mark Dinsmore's Ar/Kr Ion Laser</A></h3>

Well, a brief summary anyhow:
<p>
(From: Mark Dinsmore (dinsmore@ma.ultranet.com).)
<p>
I have built the SciAm pulsed argon ion laser and it worked quite well for me.
I think that the key for me was having a good diffusion pump vacuum system.
Argon lasers like a pretty low vacuum, and it is easy for a small leak to
contaminate them.  The pulsed version does have lots of gain, as the bore
current is quite high during the pulse.  I used a set of 1 meter confocal (if
memory serves me!) large frame ion laser optics, with about a 5% transmission
output coupler.  I used the same optics on the Helium-Selenium (HeSe) laser I
built, which was MUCH fussier about setup. Gave a nice ~100 mw multimode
output with 12 wavelengths from green to violet!  I wish I had had some
broadband ion laser optics - you can theoretically get more than 24
wavelengths at once covering red to violet!.  There's a HeSe laser on the
front cover of "Light and its Uses".
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
So, I wonder why there isn't an article on HeSe lasers in the SciAm
collection...  See the section: <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgmse1">Mark's
Helium-Selenium (HeSe) Laser</A> for more info on this laser.

<h3><A NAME="carpaol">Anthony Paolini's Ar/Kr Ion Laser</A></h3>

This is the only recent example I know of for a pulsed ion laser based on the
Sci-Am design.
<p>
(From: Anthony Paolini (apaolini@cros.net).)
<p>
<b>Introduction:</b>
<p>
Birth Announcement: It's an Argon! :)
<p>
After considerable time and effort, the Scientific American argon laser has
finally sprang to life.  It will currently generate ultra intense and highly
coherent pulses of blue/green light.  The repetition rate is about 2 pulses
second likely due to the 8 uF capacitor.  I will attempt to increase frequency
by reducing capacitance to 1 or 2 uF. Another modification in the works is a
gas reservoir to stabilize pressure. The vacuum/gas system turned out to be
most critical and demanding.  Other critical factors are mirror and window
alignment.  Here are some details.
<p>
<b>Description:</b>
<p>
The SciAm argon laser is a truly remarkable device and a worthwhile
project for any laser hobbyist. It is, in fact, capable of generating
the 1 to 2 watts of optical power as the article claims. However, the
power is divided among 10 emitted beams. A beam is emitted from each
mirror and in both directions from each window face.
<p>
In constructing this project, I did extensive experimentation in the
use of various components and configurations. These include vacuum,
mirrors, transformer, and igniter coils. The purpose of the notes that
follow is to give the prospective argon laser builder the benefits of those
experiments. This is what I did that worked!
<p>
<b>Vacuum:</b>
<p>
After experimenting with countless hardware store valves I came to the
conclusion that it is not possible to economize on vacuum equipment. My valves
are High-Vac type from Kontes. These valves have glass bodies with Teflon
seats and o-ring seals. Connections to the pump and laser are through Pyrex to
copper graded seals, also available from Kontes. From the graded seals, I used
brass range connectors, cutting off the flared ends and silver soldering.
The connection to the tube itself is via a #7 Ace Thread and nylon bushing
(do not use Teflon bushings as they have a tendency to back themselves out).
For any connections that are not soldered, use JB Weld epoxy. It is extremely
heat resistant and absolutely vacuum tight.
<p>
<b>Mirrors:</b>
<p>
I experimented with numerous mirror sets and configurations (very costly).
The set that worked best were the
<A HREF="http://www.cvilaser.com/">CVI Laser Corporation</A> AR1-0537-0-2.00CC
and AR1-0537-0-488-514. One mirror is flat and the other has a 2-meter radius
of curvature. I had an AR coating added to one mirror, which does significantly
improve output.  Along the lines of optics is window alignment. This step is
vital, albeit simple. With the bore sighted HeNe and mirrors aligned as well
as the HeNe will allow, create the "window triangle". This should be done at
atmospheric pressure as under vacuum, the ball & socket joints will not
move. The windows should be positioned vertically rather than horizontally as
per the article. Each window will then reflect the HeNe into the room. At some
point, the beams will criss-cross (about a meter from the tube). Rotate the
windows until the beam spots coincide. Then, by polarizing the HeNe, the tilt
of the windows can be adjusted for minimum reflection.
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> Do not attempt the pinhole card and spoiler alignment
procedure used with the SciAm HeNe laser, as the device has such tremendous 
ain that the spoiler will not prevent it from lasing.
<p>
<b>Power Supply:</b>
<p>
Currently, I am using a 7500 VAC, 60 mA current limited neon sign transformer.
It is configured with the case as ground and dual half-wave rectifiers as per
SciAm. A lower voltage transformer would suffice as the device, when properly
adjusted, will actually lase with the variac set to an input of about 25 VAC.
Optimum performance occurs at an input of about 70 to 80 VAC.
<p>
For triggering, I had originally used the Micro-Mite from
<A HREF="http://www.amazing1.com/">Information Unlimited (IU)</A>. This is
inadequate. The device will lase, but only at about 2 Hz. Although I have not
tried a true Oudin coil, the TV flyback transformer with the two-transistor
push-pull works very well.
<p>
<b>General Operation:</b>
<p>
After evacuating the tube, baking out, electrode heating (I used the induction
heater, IND40, from IU), and flushing with argon several times, very very
slowly admit argon with the Variac input set to 70 VAC. Widely spaced flashes
will be observed with the frequency increasing as the pressure comes up. Laser
action will begin when the pulses reach about 2 to 3 Hz. This is when mirror
alignment should be done (watch the window faces for bright blue-green spots
to appear). Optimum power is reached at the point just after the flickering
stops, but before a true continuous discharge occurs. It is a fine line
between ideal pressure and over pressure that immediately extinguishes laser
action.
<p>
<b>Comments:</b>
<p>
This device has such incredible gain that it seems a waste to spread its
output among 10 different beams. I feel a worthwhile experiment would be an
internal cavity mirror configuration similar to the popular CO2 laser design.

<h3><A NAME="carrwil">Ron Ward's Ion Laser Experiences and Comments</A></h3>

Between 1976 and 1981 I built 11 ion lasers. The first one was from
Scientific American magazine. The last one was RF excited from a SSB/CW
ham radio transmitter and 3 kW linear amplifier. I adapted this laser
from one published in Applied Physics Letters. RF excitation solved the
problem of needing 208 to 220 VAC 3 phase AC in a residence. This last laser
was made of quartz and was water cooled. It produced about 700 mW of
multi-line power with argon.
<p>
I tried the refrigerator vacuum pump scheme and it was a complete
failure. I finally bought a used two stage vacuum pump that was intended for
servicing air conditioners. I had to completely disassemble it and give
it a real good cleaning to eliminate problems associated with organic
contamination. The best thing about this vacuum pump was the electronic
vacuum gage and the price.
<p>
It took me a year to assemble the new vacuum system. I carefully
examined two vacuum systems in a Chemistry lab at U. C. Davis and set up a
metal grid system to mount the vacuum system on just like they did.  My
leak-valve consisted of two all glass stopcocks separated by about 3
inches. The first one was connected to the gas manifold and the second one
connected to the laser tube. Using a file I scratched a small line
about 45 degrees from the stopcock hole to one side of the stopcock
valve parallel with the rotating valve. To "charge" a laser I would pump
down the tube and bombard it to remove any impurities.  I also use a
propane torch to heat the laser tube and vacuum system during the
pump-down process. I would then close the stopcock to the vacuum system
and open the stopcock on the manifold side of my leak-valve.  This would
fill the space between the two stopcocks of the leak-valve with gas.  I
would then close the stopcock on the manifold side and slowly open the
leak-valve stopcock that was scratched and connected to the laser tube
to allow a controlled amount of gas to enter the laser tube. I had three
cold traps consisting of wide mouth thermoses with a glass coil immersed
in liquid nitrogen. I got the liquid nitrogen for the cold traps from a
welding gas supply company. I doubt that anyone would sell me liquid
nitrogen like that today!  The three cold traps were used as follows one
was between the mercury (!! --- Sam) diffusion pump and the mechanical pump to
prevent oil vapor from contaminating the whole system and to keep
mercury vapor out of the mechanical pump. The second one was between the
laser tube and the diffusion pump and third one was between the laser
tube and McLeod gauge. The mechanical pump exhaust was through a hose to
the outside of my house.
<p>
I had many failures trying to blow glass. Finally, I discovered and
purchased a copy of C. L. Strong's "Creative Glass Blowing". (Also see
"Neon Signs" by Fink, 1909. It has a lot of information about vacuum
systems, glass blowing, and getting a neon tube to work. The technology
of 1909 is easy to adapt for home construction.) I practiced by using
soda-lime glass and a propane torch. By pure luck I found a scientific
glass blower at the University of California at Davis. This guy KNEW how
to make stuff!!! Ever see a lathe for blowing glass? One of the first
things he taught me was to get the proper goggles so I could see what I
was doing. He had a U.S. Army surplus flashlight, one of the ones that
are made of green plastic with the business end bent at 90 degrees.
These flashlights come with clear, frosted white, and red filters. He
installed a plastic polarized filter in the flashlight. The second
filter (analyzer) was placed in a lens holder made from #10 copper
wire. Attached to the rim of the filter holder was a small bar that was
adjustable so that the distance between the two Polaroid filters could
be spaced so that the glass he was currently working on would fit
between the two polarized filters. The analyzer was adjusted so that the
minimum amount of light would be transmitted through both filters. With
a polarized light source like this you can see the lines of stress while
you are working the glass or trying to anneal it! This tool proved to be
the most valuable "Secret" to successful glass blowing I know of.  Anyone
can make one. I recommend using a car taillight and power supply for a
brighter light source. I hope that you will tell others about it! 
Anyway with his encouragement I made a real nice mercury diffusion pump
and a McLeod gage.
<p>
I bought my research grade krypton and argon form Lindy gas in 1 liter
glass flasks.
<p>
My mirrors were from a Spectra-Physics 164 argon ion laser. The reason
that I started with an argon ion laser was that I had these mirrors and
the complexity of the argon ion laser in Scientific American seemed
about the same as the HeNe laser projects. I used a heavy duty ignition
coil pulsed by a relay in place of the Oudin coil. All of the lasers that
I built using the ball joints had short operational life's, I think due
to contamination. I also used TorrSeal to attach the microscope
coveslip mirrors. One of the most difficult tasks was trying to
accurately cut the ends of the laser tube at Brewsters angle.

<h2>Additional Information on Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="carcar3">Estimate of Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser Output Power</A></h3>

Given our knowledge of the construction of a modern Ar/Kr ion laser tube and
the type of power supply used, we may be able to guestimate an upper bound on
the average output power of this apparatus.
<p>
A modern Ar/Kr ion tube with a 50 cm discharge length would likely be rated
at over a WATT  - perhaps much greater - when run from a high current power
supply.  Obviously, since this one is pulsed at a very low duty cycle, the
power will be reduced considerably.
<ul>
<li>The actual bore of the argon ion laser tube from "Light and its Uses" is
  50 cm in length with an inside diameter (ID) of 2 mm - somewhat wide for a
  modern Ar/Kr tube of similar length unless intended for multi-transverse mode
  (non-TEM00) operation.  This will certainly affect efficiency but I don't
  know by how much.  There has been some discussion of this topic on the USENET
  newsgroup <A HREF="news:sci.optics">sci.optics</A> but I have been unable to
  locate the articles.  See the section:
  <A HREF="lasercar.htm#carcar5">Credibility of the Argon Ion Laser from "Light
  and its Uses"</A> for additional comments.
<p>
  For a HeNe tube, a wider bore doesn't necessarily permit higher power
  since the walls of the capillary are important in depopulating higher
  energy levels.  I don't know how this affects ion laser performance.
  Therefore, I will assume that this is really equivalent to a 1 mm bore in a
  modern tube.
<p>
  Loss factor: .5.
<p>
<li>The power supply for the home-built Ar/Kr ion laser is pulsed DC from a
  full wave rectifier 5,000 VRMS centertapped, 30 mA (current limited) neon
  sign transformer.  The triggering is from an Oudin coil attached to an
  external electrode on the laser tube bore.
<p>
  For a 30 mA maximum source, a 1 uF capacitor can charge at 30,000 V/second
  best case.  It is not clear at what voltage the tube will fire when
  triggered or how this related to actual peak laser tube current.  There is
  no ballast resistor.  In 1/120th of a second, the cap will charge to to
  perhaps 450 V (from a tube cutoff of 200 V).
<p>
  Best case, if the energy represented by the difference between 200 and 450 V
  when dumped into the tube with the optimum current of, say 20 A, the pulse
  width would be about 15 us (very wild guess!).  Thus, compared to a modern
  ion laser run on a DC power supply, the ratio of output power to what is
  possible is about 1:(1.5E-5 * 120) or about 1:555.
<p>
  Loss factor: .9982.
<p>
<li>Once the tube starts conducting, the current will be limited only by the
  effective discharge resistance, stray inductance, the ESR of the HV cap,
  etc.  The current will NOT be anywhere near to optimal.
<p>
  Loss factor: .75.
<p>
<li>Losses due to the Brewster windows, impure gas fill, quality (or lack
  thereof) of the mirrors, and so forth, will reduce output still further.
<p>
  Loss factor: .5.
</ul>
Based on these considerations, I would be surprised if the original design
produced more than .1 mW.  This based on a comparison to a typical modern
Ar/Kr ion tube with a 50 cm bore outputting 1 W at 25 A (and the <i>peak</i>
power of the SciAm design may be in this ball park).  However, with a
somewhat more sophisticated power supply and a water jacket for cooling
(beware the high voltage!), it should be possible to boost the average power
considerably.  See the section: <A HREF="lasercar.htm#carcar4">Constructing a
High Power Ar/Kr Ion Laser at Home?</A>.

<h3><A NAME="carcar4">Constructing a High Power Ar/Kr Ion Laser at Home?</A></h3>

I believe it should be possible to boost the power output of the argon ion
laser in "Light and its Uses" somewhat by using a high temperature rated
glass for the bore and adding a water jacket, but obtaining power levels
similar to commercial ion lasers is probably unrealistic.  For starters, a
heated filament would be needed for the cathode to enable it to survive for
more than a few seconds at AMPS of continouous current.  This might be
achievable from a salvaged microwave oven magnetron - maybe. :-)
<p>
However, the more fundamental problem is cooling.
<p>
Here is a set of questions from someone with somewhat grandiose ideas:
<blockquote>
"I am a laser hobbyist, and I *really* want to build something which produces
 a non-red beam.  I already have a slew of diodes and HeNe's, but they are all
 red.  I recently found the Scientific American book "Light and its Uses", and
 it has plans for an argon ion laser.  The problem with these plans is that
 the tube is not sealed and it is a pulsed device with low average power.  I
 want CW, with a sealed tube and a reasonable output.  I have developed an
 idea for a CW argon laser with a ceramic tube and tungsten electrodes.  I
 just have a few questions about the details.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Is it possible to attach borosilicate windows to a ceramic tube using
   pottery glaze as an adhesive and firing it at a relatively low temperature
   (cooled slowly over 3 days) without cracking the windows?
<p>
 <li>Also, if I use a 2 mm capillary for the actual lasing area (the discharge
   passes through it), how long should it be (how long is it in most argon
   tubes)?  Can I use porcelain for this capillary without having it break
   down from the heat?
<p>
 <li>Can a 300 W light bulb filament (tungsten) serve as the cathode if I use a
   5 A tube current?  Finally, how well aligned do the Brewster windows have
   to be to avoid excessive beam attenuation?"
</ul>
</blockquote>
I think you are probably biting off more than you can chew for even the low
pulsed argon ion laser unless you have already built, say, the HeNe laser from
"Light and its Uses".  Argon ion laser tubes are not cheap - and for a reason.
They have to deal with at least 500 to 1,000 W of heat dissipation in the bore.
And this is for the 'smallest' air-cooled ion tubes putting out perhaps 10 to
400 mW.  Achieving adequete cooling is extremely NON-TRIVIAL!!!.  If you look
at photos of commercial argon ion laser tubes (see the chapter:
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>), they are MOSTLY
COOLING FINS!  The internal parts are made of exotic materials like BeO
(beryllium oxide - powder is a serious bio-hazard) and tungsten!  For more
comments on these issues, see the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argbcs3">Ion
Laser Bore Temperature, Materials, and BeO Warning</A>.
<p>
You probably won't end up with a sealed tube either - as it will have a very
short life.
<p>
Then, you need to have a vacuum system, tubing, gauges, the appropriate
gases, a 5 A or more 100 V current regulated power supply and igniter, etc.
<p>
Light bulb filaments are not designed for emission - they are not coated.
You would have to obtain a proper coated tungsten filament.  And, of course,
a 300 W bulb uses only about 2.5 A so even if you were able to do this and
sent current from both ends, you are on the hairy edge.  A microwave oven
magnetron tube filament might work although these are rated more in the 1 A
maximum range - more likely, several in parallel.
<p>
I must say that I encourage you to pursue your interests and passions, but
perhaps start with something somewhat less ambitious!
<p>
However, if all you want is a different colored laser, green laser pointers
are coming down in price as are other Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) lasers.
See the section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssldps">Diode Pumped Solid State
Lasers</A>.  And, yellow, orange, and green HeNe lasers (yes, HeNe lasers
come in colors other than red!) are also available.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentht1">HeNe Tubes of a Different Color</A>.

<h3><A NAME="carcar5">Credibility of the Argon Ion Laser from "Light and its
 Uses"</A></h3>

A modern Ar/Kr ion laser tube with a bore length similar to the one described
in the construction article (see the section:
<A HREF="lasercar.htm#carcar2">Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser Description</A>, will
typically have a narrower bore.  For the same 50 cm bore length, the 2 mm
inside diameter (ID) of the Scientific American design may be twice that of
a typical commercial laser.  The current threshold for lasing will be higher
and this is likely to result in multi-transverse mode (non-TEM00) operation as
well.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself but would preclude the use
of this laser for interferometry or (gasp!) holography.
<p>
If you decide to attempt the argon ion laser, I would probably recommend using
a slightly smaller bore - perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 mm which would be closer to that
of a commercial ion tube with the same bore length.  Then, the current
thresholds should be similar and the narrower bore has a better chance of
forcing TEM00 mode as well, though I don't know for sure if this would be
guaranteed.
<p>
There have also been comments that this design won't work at all due to the use
of a .65 mm ID bore.  Aside from difficulties in the fabrication of a laser
tube with such a narrow bore (keeping it straight enough, mirror alignment,
etc.), there could also be problems with resonator gain resulting in weak or
total lack of oscillation.  However, I have no idea where the value of .65 mm
came from.  The article in "Light and its Uses" (from the Amateur Scientist
column in Scientific American of February, 1969) clearly specifies the bore ID
of 2 mm in more than one place.  So, unless a change was made without comment
when the book was published (I haven't checked the original magazine), there
doesn't appear to be any basis in reality for this concern. :)

<h2>Alternatives to Constructing an Ar/Kr Ion Laser from Scratch</h2>
<h3><A NAME="carcar6">Rebuilding an Ar/Kr Ion Tube</h3>

Although not as common as dead HeNe laser tubes, small air-cooled Ar/Kr Ion
tubes in non-working condition are available for next to nothing from people
who repair these systems.  Both internal and external mirror types are common
(e.g., NEC-3030 and ALC-60X/Omni-532).  Where the tube failed due to low
pressure (no lasing) or high pressure (won't start), it may be possible to
regas it without too much trouble - at least for experiments.  Don't expect to
be able to seal off the tube once you are done playing - it is unlikely you
will have the needed equipment or skills for it to last more than a few hours,
if that.  However, such as approach if you get the right sort of tube (not
one that failed due to excessive current and sputtering or cathode sag) may be
much easier as a means of getting into gas lasers than building one from the
ground up.
<p>
For more information, see the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnchn5">Sam's
Three Part Process for Getting Your Feet Wet in Gas Lasers</A>.  That procedure
was written with HeNe lasers in mind but can easily be converted for Ar/Kr ion
tubes.  However, depending on what type you acquire, some portions may not
apply (e.g., if yours already has Brewster windows for external mirror
operation).
<p>
And, your next question is probably: "Can I convert a HeNe laser into an ion
laser?".  The short answer is: forget it!  The long answer is: forget it!
Nearly everything would need to be changed - mirrors, cathode, power supply.
About the only thing you'd be left with is the capillary and that would melt
down in about 10 milliseconds unless you were running low duty cycle pulsed
mode and that probably is much more trouble than it is worth.  I've heard of
people torturing HeNe tubes by passing AMPs of current through them.  The
result isn't something to be discussed in public. :)

<h3><A NAME="carcar7">The Half-Way Approach for a Home-Built Ar/Kr Ion Laser</A></h3>

OK, so you really want to play with an external mirror ion laser but don't have
access to the resources, a suitable work area, or more likely, the determination
to deal with the glassworking, vacuum, gas-fill, and other requirements of a
totally home-built Ar/Kr ion tube.
<p>
Argon ion plasma tubes with Brewster windows for use with an external resonator
are widely available both new and surplus.  With one of these in-hand, and a
matching conventional power supply, you can still experience the joy and
frustration of constructing and aligning an external mirror laser head.  It then
is *just* a matter of fabricating the laser platform and mirror mounts, and
obtaining a pair of suitable mirrors.  There would be NO excuse for failure!
<p>
If you insist on buying new, check out the large well known ion laser
manufacturers.  The type of ion tube you are interested is probably a small
air-cooled model like an ALC-60X.  Perhaps, if you can convince them it is for
an educational project, they might let you have one that doesn't quite meet
their specs for free or at cost.  Otherwise, expect to spend several $K!  Used
and surplus tubes are sometimes offered for sale on the USENET newsgroups
<A HREF="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</A> and
<A HREF="news:sci.optics">sci.optics</A>, and from the various companies listed
in the chapter <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A>.  It
should be possible to buy one for less than $100 in this manner - but its
condition and remaining life may be big unknowns.
<p>
However, you them must obtain or build a power supply for your tube.  While you
can use the same sort of approach as with the totally home-built design - a neon
sign transformer based power supply - this would certainly not make the best use
of such a tube though it might be something worth doing initially.  (Note: These
use a hot cathode and a suitable filament supply would also be needed.)  And,
there is the issues of cooling - very non-trivial for these small air-cooled
tubes.  Lose cooling for a minute and the tube will likely be damaged if running
at even its idle current of a few amps.  The advantage of the SciAm style power
supply is that with its low duty cycle, cooling is not an issue.  Of course,
there won't be much output power either especially given the short bores of these
air-cooled tubes!
<p>
Perhaps, after successfully constructing a laser head in this manner, you will
have the confidence to proceed with a totally home-built design.
<p>
The opposite situation is also a possibility: Build your own plasma tube but
mount it in a used resonator.  Depending on your resources, this might be an
easier task (though I find that hard to imagine!).  External cavity laser heads
with dead tubes seem to turn up much more frequently than the other way around
(for obvious reasons)!  However, in the case of small air-cooled Ar ion heads,
both tubes and complete laer heads are readily available at reasonable cost -
it is the power supplies that are less common and more expensive.
