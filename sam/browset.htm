<h2>Introduction</h2>

Although there will never be any requirement that a particular browser or
operating system be used to access these documents, for your optimum reading
pleasure, it may be desirable to tweak some things in your browser's
preferences.  While some of these are a matter of aesthetics or personal
taste and I don't expect everyone to share mine, others like the fixed
width fonts, are more critical.

<h2>Browser Settings</h2>

These are the only ones I can think of and chances are they are already
configured appropriately but it won't hurt to check:

<ul>
<li><b>Fonts:</b> To make sense of the many ASCII schematics, diagrams, and
 tables, the fixed-width font in your browser's preferences must be correctly
 set up.  I use "QuickType Mono".  Others that are suitable include "Lucida
 Console" and "Courier New".  All formatted material is assumed to be a maximum
 of 80 columns in width.  Thus it's best to adjust the width of your browser
 window so that at least 80 columns fit if possible.  (For the variable width
 font I use "Arial" but there's nothing special about that choice, it's just
 one I like.)  Both fonts are set to 12 point for my 1280x1024 pixel display.
<p>
<li><b>Colors:</b> No settings are specified in these documents for text
 or background colors so it's up to you to set defaults in your browser.  I'll
 offer my current favorites but feel free to ignore them (R,G,B values in
 decimal): bgcolor=0,0,0 (black), text=238,224,208 (warm white), link=255,221,0
 (yellow), vlink=255,153,0 (orange), alink=255,153,0 (orange).  I wasn't going
 to bother with color but when I experienced Sam's Laser FAQ with light
 colored text on a dark background, I was hooked.  As a rationalization of
 sorts, this color scheme <b>is</b> easier on CRT-based computer monitors.
<p>
 The only real disadvantage I can see is that for printing, it will be best
 to change your browser preferences to use black text on a white background
 unless you have stock in an ink company! ;)
<p>
 If you want to install these colors in local copies of any of the documents,
 replace the &lt;BODY> line with the following:
<p>
<PRE>
    &lt;BODY bgcolor="#000000" text="#eee0d0" link="#ffdd00" vlink="#ff9900"
     alink="#ff9900">
</PRE>
<p>
 (These are the same colors as those given above but in hexadecimal.)
<p>
<li><b>PDF:</b> Many of the more complex diagrams and schematics are
 available only in Adobe PDF format.  Thus, a PDF plugin or application
 capable of reading PDF files will be required.  Note that conversion from
 PDF to other formats can be accomplished in several ways including
 performing a screen save or using the shareware program, Ghostview (which
 will generate a BMP file) followed by a graphics program like LVIEWP or
 MSPAINT.
<p>
<li><b>Java:</b> Except for the entry page to the "Laser, Optics, and
 Holography Ring" (in Sam's Laser FAQ), there is no Java of any kind in
 any of these documents.  Thus, unless you intend to access the Ring, Java
 can be disabled in your browser if desired.  Of course, I can't guarantee
 what might be at the far end of links to other sites.  However, some like
 eBay searches, run faster with less fluff when Java is disabled!
<p>
<li><b>Frames:</b> There are none.  Rendering on different browsers/platforms
 is never the same and it makes mirroring or grabbing all the info from the
 site more difficult, tedious, and messy.
<p>
<li><b>Search:</b> The Drexel University mirror site has a fast search
 facility which is also accessible from Repairfaq.org and the UPenn mirror
 site.  Should this not be adequate, the cheapest, easiest search capability
 can be performed using Google or some other Internet search engine with
 www.repairfaq.org as the domain along with any other search terms.
