The following are listed in no particular order and thus their position in
this list does not represent any sort of rating - good, bad, or in between!
See the specific comments under selected titles for recommendations.
<p>
Note that some of these titles are quite old - truly vintage - and may be of
interest more for collectible value than anything else.  However, it is quite
remarkable how much was actually known about the physics and technology of
lasers only a couple of years after their invention!

<li>The Laser Cookbook: 88 Practical Projects<br>
 Gordon McComb<br>
 TAB Books Inc, 1988<br>
 Blue Ridge Summit, PA 17214<br>
 ISBN: 0-8306-9390-4 (paperback)
<p>
 This inexpensive ($21.95) book contains a wealth of interesting projects
 that can be performed with diode and helium-neon lasers. These projects
 range from interferometers, to communications, to fiberoptics, to
 holography, to light shows.  Something for everyone.  There are a few
 small technical errors but nothing that reading Sam's Laser FAQ won't
 correct. :)
<p>
 There is now a new edition with a new title.  Aside from the goofy title,
 it is an updated version of a very good book:

  Blue Ridge Summit, PA 17214<br>
  ISBN: 0-8306-0204-6, ISBN: 0-8306-0604-1 (paperback)
<p>
  This includes plans for a HeNe laser power supply as well as complete
  ruby/Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers and other interesting stuff.  (The laser
  projects are almost identical to those in [3], below.)
<p>
<li>Build your own working Fiberoptic, Infrared, & Laser Space-Age Projects<br>
  Robert E. Iannini<br>
  TAB books, a division of McGraw-Hill, 1987<br>
  Blue Ridge Summit, PA 17214<br>
  ISBN: 0-8306-2724-3
<p>
  This includes plans for two HeNe laser power supplies as well as complete
  ruby/Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers and other interesting stuff. (The laser
  projects are almost identical to those in [2], above.)
<p>
<li>Scientific American, major articles and in particular, the monthly column,
 "The Amateur Scientist".  The most relevant time period will be 1960 to
 1980 but there has been more recent laser and related material.  The most
 convenient source is [5], below.
<p>
<li>Light and its Uses, (readings from Scientific American) C. L. Strong's
 "The Amateur Scientist" with introductions by Jeral Walker.<br>
 W. H. Freeman And Co., articles copyright 1952 to 1980<br>
 ISBN: 0-7167-1184-2, ISBN: 0-7167-1185-0 (paperback)
<p>
 Extensive information on how to build lasers and how to use them, as well
 as info on building laser instruments (including several interferometers
 and spectrographs) and making holograms of various types (optical,
 microwave, acoustic).  All of John Strong's (genius experimentalist) and
 Jeral Walker's columns on photonic devices are in this absolutely fabulous
 collection.  See the section: <A HREF="laserclt.htm#cltlau">Light and its
 Uses - Complete Table of Contents for a complete list of articles</A>.
<p>
 The book describes the construction of several types of lasers by amateurs
 including HeNe, argon ion, dye, CO2, and nitrogen - all from scratch
 (e.g., the HeNe and argon lasers require glassworking to fabricate the
 plasma tube.)  It is not for the absolute beginner but suitable for anyone
 who has some considerable hobbyist type experience with electronics and/or
 lasers.
<p>
 Note: To actually construct most of these projects requires a fair degree
 of skill and determination; access to some machining, glassworking, and/or
 high vacuum facilities; a source of electronic, optical, and mechanical
 components; and a stock of chemicals and other materials.  However, much
 of this can be provided without the assets of a major R&D laboratory but
 will require improvisation.  Nonetheless, the book makes for some very
 interesting and educational reading even if you are not going to be
 building anything.  See the chapters starting with
 <A HREF="lasercon.htm#contoc">Amateur Laser Construction for more info on
 how to get started in home-built lasers</A>.
<p>
<li>Various Laser Handbooks from CRC Press.  Go to
 <A HREF="http://www.crcpress.com/">CRC Press</A> and take the links to
 "Physics", then "Lasers, Optics, and Optoelectronics".
 These will set you back a bit in the $$$ department if you
 insist on ordering them for your private
 collection, but will include just about everything you ever
 wanted (or didn't want) to know about all sorts of serious laser science
 and technology topics. They should have what you need to be able to answer
 questions like: "Will a mixture of hydrogen and plutonium lase?  What are its
 wavelengths and gain?" and other burning (no pun...) questions that keep you
 up at night!  Yet more guaranteed cures for insomnia - check out your local
 university library today!
<p>
<li>Nuts and Volts magazine has a monthly column called "Laser Insight" which
 covers all sorts of topics from holography to building a ruby laser.
<p>
<li>Some older issues of Popular Electronics and Radio Electronics have
 articles on how to use HeNe lasers and power supplies for them (maybe
 1980 to 1989).
<p>
<li>Forrest Mims' Circuit Scrapbook II<br>
 Forrest Mims<br>
 Howard Sams & Co., 1987
<p>
 This book is out of print but available at some libraries. It provides
 various driver circuits and a miniature laser + driver + battery built
 into a very small package.
<p>
 Forrest Mims has also written a number of articles on how to use and build
 lasers.  He is also an occasional contributor to the USENET newsgroups
 including those on the sci.electronics hierarchy.

 Library of Congress Catalog Number: 65-27659
<p>
 If you always wanted to really understand terms like population inversion,
 hyperfine transitions, and quantum efficiency, this old but solid book is
 for you.  Be prepared for some heavy math.  However, it does include some
 practical aspects of laser construction as well.
<p>

 ISBN: 0-8306-671-8, 0-8306-1671-3 (paperback)
<p>
 Coverage of optical fibers, lenses, lasers, applications.  A potpourri of
 topics, some rather sporadic but interesting nonetheless.  Just take any
 circuits with a grain of silicon (if you look at Figure 7.2 you will know
 what I mean!).
<p>
<li>Understanding Lasers<br>

 ISBN: 0-8306-9115-4, 0-8306-3115-1 (paperback)
<p>
 Much useful information but the only actual projects uses an IR laser
 diode to construct a simple communication link.  And, their pathetic
 attempt at a laser diode driver circuit is amusing to say the least!
 (Hint: the design cannot possibly work as described.)
<p>
<li>Wedding Lasers to Power Supplies<br>
 Photonics Spectra, June 1982
<p>
 This is a nice article on general power supply considerations for HeNe
 and (small sealed) CO2 lasers.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/">The Bell Jar - Vacuum Technique
 for the Amateur</A> is a collection of information as well as a
 newsletter on high vacuum technology for
 amateurs which sometimes includes laser information.  A vacuum system will
 be required if you are interested in constructing your own gas laser from
 scratch.  Articles are archived at their web site
<p>
<li>Some of the earlier columns of "The Laser Experimenter" (1995) went into
 detail on how to make light shows, and how to construct the power supplies
 for the HeNe type of lasers.
<p>
<li>The March 1989 issue of Radio-Electronics magazine has plans for a HeNe
 power supply running on 12 VDC using a 555 timer chip and two transistors,
 a relay, and a 12 V to 280 V step-up transformer.

You may be able to find many of these items in a large public or university
library. The old issues of magazines are often on microfilm or microfiche.
Older books like "Light and its Uses" [5] may be locked away in the dungeons
of the library's archives so you may have to ask for them.

<h3><A NAME="lirtrd">Free Lasers/Optics Trade Magazines</A></h3>

There are several 'trade rags' for the laser and optics industry.  Although
advertising-heavy like those for electronics and other fields, they do have
many interesting cutting edge articles of interest to hobbyists,
experimenters, and researchers alike.  It should be possible to obtain a free
subscription if you are either a student or can convince them that you might
be in a position to buy or recommend laser and/or optics related products.
Even if your business or 'official' occupation has nothing to do with lasers,
it won't hurt to try for a subscription.
<p>
Most of these publications also feature an email service to keep you informed
of the latest hot industry news with links to associated on-line articles.
You can generally subscribe to these with even fewer or no questions asked as
long as you have an email address.
<p>
Two of the major players are probably
<A HREF="http://www.photonicsspectra.com/">Photonics Spectra</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.laserfocus.com/">Laser Focus World</A>.
For additional possibilities, see the section:
<A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirweb7">Laser Related Publications</A>.
<p>
Occasionally, there may be a bonus issue like the telephone book thickness
"2000 Buyers Guide" from Laser Focus World or the full color spectrum (and
other laser info) wall chart found in the August, 2000 issue of Photonics
Spectra (that is, if your office mate didn't beat you to it!).
<p>
Subscriptions to both the publication and email news service are available
via their Web sites.

<h3><A NAME="lirpat">Patents</A></h3>

A great deal of general information is publicly available in the form of U.S.
(and foreign) patents.  With the modern computer age, searching for any and
all types of information is possible via a number of patent database web
sites.  Many of these charge for full access but some are still free.
<p>
In the good old days (say 4 years ago), IBM had a patent database Web site
which included complete text and graphics for patents covering most of the
years relevant to lasers and it was totally free.  That was then taken over
by another organization (I refuse to help with their cash flow by naming
them) resulting in a blitz of banner ads.  Now, with the crash of the
.bom, oops, .com bubble, they are charging for graphics downloads via
subscription (text was still free last time I checked).  (Should by any
chance someone from that unnamed company read this, I have no problem
with charging for regular commercial use of a patent database.  However,
for the private individual
who browses occasional patents to satisfy their curiosity rather than
commercial gain, I think that the best approach would be to allow limited
free access to the graphics - say 30 patents/month.  This would cost you
nothing and would generate good will and recommendations rather than abuse.
And I wouldn't have removed 37 links to your service from my Web site!)
<p>
For now, the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/">US Patent
& Trademark Office</A> has the most advanced search capabilities
of Web sites with free access.  Access and download is free (your
tax dollars at work!) and should remain so.  They have complete
text and graphics but require that your browser has a late model
TIFF reader plug-in.  It must
be able to display TIFF files using ITU T.6 or CCITT
Group 4 (G4) compression.  See their:
<A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/help/images.htm">Patent Full-Page Images
Help Page</A> for information on system requirements and recommended plug-ins.
The one annoying thing is that pages can be saved or printed only one at
a time.
<p>
Patents may be located by number, subject, inventor, (and other fields),
or boolean text, as well as more advanced criteria.  All patents referenced by
a particular patent as well as all patents which reference that patent may be
instantly located.  The complete patent documents including diagrams are
available at this web site for download.  Copies may also be ordered (for
a small fee).
<p>
Searching on the keyword 'laser' will turn up too many patents to consider.
However, narrowing this with 'semiconductor' or 'driver' will restrict the
search enough to home in on patents of interest.  There will still be many
that are likely to be of interest - you can spend days (or longer) at this!
<p>
Where the patent number is known (or can be found by searching the USPTO Web
site, above), more convenient alternatives for accessing the complete patent
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/">FreePatentsOnline.com</A>.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.us-patent-search.com/">US Patent Search.com</A>.
 Registration is required but downloads are free for now at least.
</ul>
<p>
Patents including all text and graphics may be downloaded and saved or
printed as multipage (single) PDF documents in addition to TIFF images
(individual pages or complete documents in some cases).  These may
actually be the same source as there are many similarities in their behavior.
<p>
As of Fall, 2008, Google has a patent search facility which may be faster
and easier to use than the others, above.  If you have a patent number,
it is certainly very fast with both searchable text and graphics instantly
available free without requiring registration.  It will also search
text before 1976, which is not possible with the USPTO Web iste.  Go to:
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en">Google Patents</A>.
<p>
Of course, it is also possible to search for patents the old fashioned way at
your local large public library or by browsing the main patent office stacks
in Washington, DC.  However, these sorts of methods seam terribly archaic in
comparison to the use of a modern patent database engine.

<h2>Newsgroups, Discussion Groups and Technical Forums, Listservers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="lirnld0">Laser Related USENET Newsgroups</A></h3>

USENET newsgroups are public bulletin board-like forums for discussions of any
sort of topic under the Sun (and beyond).  There are over 20,000 active
newsgroups in the USA alone and more are being created every microsecond.
<p>
I know of two newsgroups most suitable for discussion of laser related topics:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</a> (Primarily lasers)
<li><a href="news:sci.optics">sci.optics</a> (All types of optics)
</ul>
<p>
Generally, sci.optics is to be preferred as it attracts many serious and
knowledgeable participants.  However, quite often, questions may appear
only on alt.lasers.  There are many others that may be of interest including
sci.engr.lighting, sci.optics.fiber, those in the sci.electronics and
sci.physics hierarchies, and more.  Check with your ISP to determine what
is available - it may be possible to request they add specific groups.
<p>
As with any type of discussion group, listen before you dive in.  Get a feel
for the types of questions that are typical and do not post a reply unless
you are fairly confident of your answer!  Basic questions are acceptable but
it is proper etiquette to first attempt to locate the answer by checking past
postings by searching at <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/">Google
Groups</A> (formerly Deja.com/Dejanews) or one of the other public USENET
archives.
<p>
A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) document also exists for sci.optics.  The
<A HREF="http://www.ndirect.co.uk/wavefront/scioptic/faq.htm">Sci.Optics
FAQ</A> may already have answered your question as well.
<p>
If you don't know how to access USENET newsgroups, check with your ISP
(Internet Service Provider - maybe it's even in the user manual - what a
concept!), or your local system administrator or network guru.  Usually News
access is via the software provided by your ISP, from within your Web browser
(e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), through the use of a special News
utility, or from within other programs like GNUS EMACS.  Some initial
configuration will have to be done to identify the NNTP (Network News Transfer
Protocol) server (your newsfeed) to whatever software you are using - this is
site specific - your ISP or keeper of the magic will know. :)

<h3><A NAME="lirnld1">Laser Discussion Groups and Technical Forums</A></h3>

These are basically private newsgroups and accessible through a Web link
rather than the normal USENET protocol.  In some cases, posting (but not
reading) may be possible by sending email to a specific address.  Some may
require registration but there is no charge.  In general, I do not see any
really compelling reason to use this approach when appropriate USENET
newsgroups exist - as they do for laser science, technology, and applications
with <a href="news:alt.lasers">alt.lasers</a> and
<a href="news:sci.optics">sci.optics</a>.  The laser community is not
that large as to justify a multitude of discussion groups and there is
only so much time in the day to check them.  Having a single newsgroup
also has more fundamental benefits in providing a broader range of
topics of general interest with input coming from people with diverse
backgrounds.  I've seen people put a great deal of time and effort into
setting up a really nice set of discussion groups along with other
services only to have them whither away and die due to lack of traffic.
And what usually happens is that to cover all bases, people will post
to alt.lasers as well anyhow!
<p>
For other laser light show discussion groups, check out the links in the
section: <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirnld2">Laser (Email) Listservers</A>.
(There may also be chatrooms included here since chatrooms are sort of like
real-time discussion groups.)  The main reason some of the forums and
chatrooms exist is to get people to go the commercial sites of those who
started them (via advertisements, gyrating links, etc.).  Not surprisingly,
the traffic on most of these is minimal.
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.laserists.com/">Laserists.com Laser Forums</A>
 is a resource for people working with display and cutting/marking systems.
 It currently has forums for topics in CO2 lasers, YAG and fiber lasers,
 software, projects, the industry, and general areas.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.Laserenthusiast.com/">Laser Enthusiasts.com</A>
 includes a variety of forums mostly on topics related to lasers such as
 those in laser pointers and laser modules - suppliers, modifications,
 construction using laser diodes and optics, etc.  There are some
 general discussions forums as well, buy and sell, auctions, vendor
 reviews, and more.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://laserpointerforums.com/">Laser Pointer Forums</A> has
 a number of discussion groups on all sorts of laser related topics other
 than laser pointers.  This is fairly active, as these things go. :)
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://chatlasers.com">ChatLasers.com</A> is an IM-type
 forum where it is possible to chat in real time to like minded people
 about lasers, projectors, pointers and standards.  This just started
 in Winter 2008, so no telling whether it will be the next BIG thing. :)
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.photonlexicon.com/forums/">Phtonicxicon.com</A>
 hosts several laser related discussion groups including those for laser
 shows and technical issues.  These seem to be moderately active, at least
 compared to most of the others!
<p>
<li>There is a group for info on laser repair, support for current
 and "obsolete" lasers, problems, part sources, etc.:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/laserusers/">Yahoo Groups - Laser
  Users</A>
 </ul>
<p>
Currently, traffic is next to nonexistent but who knows?
<p>
<li>There is also one strictly for ruby lasers at:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li><A HREF="http://www.industrycommunity.com/myforum/marc_ecker/">Marc
  Ecker's Ruby Laser Message Board</A>
 </ul>
 But there appear to have been no postings after 2003.
 <p>
<li>
 Other public discussion group sites like
 <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Groups</A> (formerly eGroups) may be
 worth checking as well.  Searching for "lasers" turned up several rather
 esoteric laser related forums but nothing of a general nature.  However,
 there is a new hologrphay forum and now one on laser processing.
<p>
<li>For (mostly) laser show related topics, there is a discussion group
 hosted by <A HREF="http://www.laserfx.com/">LaserFX</A> accessible via the
 <A HREF="http://www.laserfx.com/Backstage.LaserFX.com/Discussions/FXforum_frm.html">LaserFX - Laser Forums Web Page</A>.  (There used to be several forums
 but they have been combined due to lack of traffic.)
</ul>
<p>
 Of these, the first two are most likely to deal with laser technology,
 engineering, construction, and repair.  As with the other technical forums,
 traffic is relatively low but worth checking and posting with serious
 questions since people who are knowledgeable are likely to monitor these
 discussion groups.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.spie.org/">SPIE - The International Society for Optical
 Engineering</A> would probably be considered the predominant photonics
 professional organization.  They are now hosting a number of technical forums
 which can be found at the <A HREF="http://spie.org/app/tg/index.cfm">SPIE
 Technical Group Home Page</A>.  These are intended to replace their email
 discussion groups.  The one most relevant to our needs is called "Laser
 Sources".
<p>
<li>There are also a number of discussion groups associated with the
 <A HREF="http://www.ilda.wa.org/">International Laser Display Association
 (ILDA)</A> which deal with all aspects of laser display and entertainment
 including technical, safety, and regulatory issues.  Take the link to
 "Come join the ILDA Forums".
<p>
<li>And one for holography: at
 <A HREF="http://www.holographyforum.org/">Colin Kaminski's Holography
 Forum</A>.
<p>
<li>For topics related to amateur laser construction and other amateur
 scientist activities, check out the following:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><A HREF="http://www.sas.org/">Society for Amateur Scientists</A>
  (Includes an on-line discussion forum)
 </ul>
</ul>

There may be additional discussion groups and technical forums associated
with specific Web sites not listed above - sorry, I wish I could keep up
with all of them!

<h3><A NAME="lirnld2">Laser (Email) Listservers</A></h3>

Unlike USENET newsgroups which are accessible via most on-line services and
ISPs, listservers are email discussion groups which must be subscribed to
usually by sending a special email message to the listserver host.  Depending
on the charter, these may be available to everyone but some are restricted.
<p>
Once subscribed, all email sent to a specified address is distributed to all
users of the listserver group.  Thus, you can elect to participate in any or
all discussions, or simply just monitor the traffic for your own interest or
research.  As with USENET newsgroups, don't jump into a discussion without
having an idea of the context - what has already transpired and then only if
you have a valid question or can contribute in a knowledgeable way to the
discussion.
<p>
You can find a large number of totally public lists at
<A HREF="http://tile.net/lists/">Tile.net - Lists</A> but
this site has few, if any, related to our types of laser discussions
(unless you are interested in laser eye surgery).  But never fear, there *are*
others available.
<p>
The following are some general laser listservers with information on the
charters and how to subscribe:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Lasers List hosted by
 <A HREF="http://www.neurotica.com/">Neurotica.com</A>.
<p>
 This list is dedicated to all aspects of lasers from home construction to
 light show hardware and software.  Join by sending email to
 Majordomo@neurotica.com with "subscribe lasers your_email_address" (without
 the "".  Your email address may be omitted if it is the one your are using
 to send the request) in the body of the message.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.qsl.net/wb9ajz/laser/laser.htm">Laser Reflector</A>
  (Amateur radio laser communications).
<p>
  Anyone with an interest in laser communications is welcome to join. You don't
  need to be a ham radio operator.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserlia.htm#lialco1">Amateur Laser Communications</A> for more
  info.
</ul>

<h2>Laser and Optics Related Links</h2>
<h3><A NAME="lirwser">Searching for Laser Information on the Web</A></h3>

It is often possible to get a good starting point on finding relevant Web sites
with a simple Net search such as provided by Altavista, Lycos, Yahoo, and many
others.  With just a little care with the selection of key words and search
parameters, an assortment of high quality links are often returned on the first
shot.  Though, with the wrong search, you may end up with a bunch of junk! :)
Some of the search engines will also suggest additional lists of sites with
similar technology (sometimes they are even relevant to your interests!).
<p>
USENET newsgroup postings for the last several years can also be searched via
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</A> (formerly
Deja.com/Dejanews).  While there are other public USENET archives, although
the name keeps changing, Google Groups probably has the largest and most
reliable newsgroup coverage and goes back the farthest (to 1995).  Thus I see
little reason to use other archives which may come and go and provide more
sporatic coverage.
<p>
Private discussion groups and technical forums often have searchable archives
as well.  See the section: <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirnld">Newsgroups,
Discussion Groups and Technical Forums, Listservers</A>
<p>
The sections that follow provide links to many other laser related sites with
the first of these being a Webring currently under development.  This should
be of particular interest to the hobbyist and experimenter.
<p>
Several hundred links have been accumulated over time from various USENET
newsgroups, other discussion groups and technical forums, Net searches, links
found at other Web sites, and private email.  They are loosely grouped by the
type of information provided but are otherwise only in somewhat more-or-less
alphabetical order.
<p>

<h3><A NAME="lirlohwr">The Laser, Optics, and Holography Ring</A></h3>

A <b>Webring</b> is a collection of related sites linked by a virtual hub
maintained by <A HREF="http://www.webring.org">Webring.Org</A>.  This should
facilitate convenient navigation among them and minimize the overhead in
maintaining HTML links at multiple locations as sites come and go or change
their URLs.
<p>
The Laser, Optics, and Holography Ring brings together Websites that either
are about lasers, optics and holography, or contain information in related
areas.  It was developed, and is owned and managed by Flavio Spedalieri
