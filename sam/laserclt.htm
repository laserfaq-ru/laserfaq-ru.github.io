<h2>Introduction to Descriptions and Designs of Home-Built Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cltcit0">What is in this Chapter?</A></h3>

Having survived a discussion of lab/workshop safety and requirements, vacuum
systems, glass working, optics, and power supplies, it is now time to look into
the detailed features and characteristics of the types of the lasers that are
possible to construct at home.  This chapter is a sort of introduction to the
detailed chapters on each of the lasers that follow.  In addition, there are
some comments later on that may be of help in deciding which home-built laser
to tackle first (or second or third).  At the end of this chapter is
information on the Scientific American (SciAm) laser articles including the
collection: "Light and its Uses" and possible on-line access to this
valuable resource.
<p>
Each of the chapters that follow are dedicated to one particular type of
home-built laser.  For most, it is one of those presented in Scientific
American which is first summarized, followed by any non-SciAm designs, and
other related information.  There may also be other projects specifically
related to each type of laser.  Some of these (like the ones on the HeNe laser
in particular), may require much less custom work by using more off-the-shelf
new or surplus parts and are thus alternatives to diving into a fully
home-built design.
<p>
Note that the ORDER of the first 7 of the following chapters is based on the
sequence in which these lasers were presented in Scientific American and does
NOT reflect their level of difficulty!  For that, please see the comments
starting in the section: <A HREF="laserclt.htm#cltcwltb">Which Laser to
Build?</A> and the more specific information in each chapter.
<p>
In the chapter for each type of home-built laser, information directly related
to the relevant SciAm laser (where applicable) will be presented roughly as
follows (not all of these items will be present for every laser):

<ol>
<li>Introduction and general description.
<p>
<li>Specific laser output, electrical, and other safety information.
<p>
<li>Links to relevant Web sites with additional information including some
 that offer kits, plans, or even completed lasers (don't whimp out on me!).
<p>
<li>Photos or links to photos of completed home-built lasers.
<p>
<li>Diagrams showing major mechanical and electronic assemblies of typical
  home-built lasers.
<p>
<li>Summary of the major optical, physical, and electrical, characteristics
  and requirements, including an estimated 'level of difficulty' profile.  See
  the section: <A HREF="laserclt.htm#cltcit1">Home-Built Laser Description</A>.
<p>
<li>Sources for parts and supplies relevant to each particular type of
  home-built laser.
<p>
<li>Guidelines for improving the chances of a successful outcome for
  construction of those lasers that are finicky about their design or
  fabrication and which shouldn't be modified (except as noted) until the
  basic version is happily lasing.
<p>
<li>Any errata, suggestions, improvements, or other information that might
  simplify construction, alignment, enhance reliability, or boost power
  output, as well as identifying any special safety considerations.
<p>
<li>Email correspondance with those who have attempted their construction
  possibly including additional complete laser descriptions as in (4), above.
<p>
<li>Articles, newsgroup, and discussion group postings relating to the
  particular type of home-built laser.
</ul>

Where the same type of laser (e.g., HeNe, Ar/Kr ion, CO2) is covered in Part
III of this document, those chapters should be read FIRST since the basic
characteristics and principles of operation are described there.

<h3><A NAME="cltcit1">Home-Built Laser Description</A></h3>

Each of the following chapters include a description of the corresponding
laser from the Amateur Scientist article of Scientific American (or the
collection "Light and its Uses") if one exists.  This will include a somewhat
standardized summary of the most important physical, electrical, and optical
characteristics of the laser including the resonator, and necessary power
supply, and vacuum system or other special requirements.  An estimate of the
required skills and level of difficulty for each will also be provided.
<p>
The format of the laser specifications will follow the general outline given
below.  (Since most of these are gas lasers many of the entries will be
missing for the dye laser and solid state lasers.)
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Glass work (if any).
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work).
  <li>Vacuum/gas handling.
  <li>Power supply.
  <li>Additional apparatus (optics, alignment jig, etc.)
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.).
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - Output wavelengths which are obtainable with the
  design as described as well as possible others that may be produced with
  straightforward modifications.
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium (gas, solid, liquid).  All but one of these (the dye
    laser) use gas or vapors from sublimation or heating of a liquid or solid
    as the lasing medium.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter (ID/OD), bore length (millimeters/inches).  The bore is the
    actual location where lasing action is supposed to take place in a gas
    laser.  It may also be called the 'capillary'.  While the overall laser
    tube may be much larger, and the electrical discharge is usually not
    confined to the bore, for all intents and purposes, one can assume that
    only the lasing medium inside the bore participates in stimulated emission
    because the discharge is usually much more concentrated there.
<p>
  <li>Total tube length - includes additional space beyond the actual bore
    (e.g., to the center of the Brewster windows).
<p>
  <li>Tube material - glass (soda-lime or borosilicate), Plexiglas, etc.
<p>
  <li>Electrodes (type, materials, construction) - All of these gas lasers use
    some variation of a cold cathode design.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill (Gases, pressure/range, purity) - This will include pressures or
    partial pressures and molar/volume ratios.
<p>
  <li>Cooling (convection air, forced air, water) - All are convection air
    cooled except for the CO2 which is water cooled.  Adding water cooling to
    the others like the argon ion laser may permit their output power to be
    boosted.
<p>
  <li>Coupling (internal mirrors, Brewster windows, etc.).
<p>
  <li>Mirrors (HR/OC, coating, figure/shape, reflectance, mounts, alignment).
    Most are dielectric type, either planar or confocal concave.  Mirror
    mounts.  RoC denotes Radius of Curvature; R denotes reflectance (usually
    at a specified wavelength or range of wavelengths).
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length (mirror to mirror).
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
  <li>Requirements - low-medium (e.g., N2 laser, dye laser flashlamp) or medium
    (most others).
<p>
  <li>Sealed/flowing - All can be sealed to some extent though the lifetime of
    these home-made laser tubes is not that long.  Thus, some means of
    regassing without glass work is desirable.  The CO2 probably requires
    a flowing gas design.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required (other than gases).
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type (electrical/optical) - All the gas lasers are pumped electrically;
    the dye laser uses a flashlamp.
<p>
  <li>Power supply (DC/AC/RF, pulse, voltage/current/power/frequency,
    regulation).
</ul>
<p>
  The following notation will be used to denote input and output connections:
<p>
<ul>
<li>G = AC line safety (earth) Ground.
<li>H = AC line Hot.
<li>N = AC line Neutral.
<p>
<li>HV AC = the output of AC power supplies.
<li>HV+ (or similar) = a positive output of DC power supplies but prior to any ballast resistor or special pulser.
<li>HV- = the negative return for DC power supplies.
</ul>
</ul>

The beauty of a home-built laser is that there is no law that says you cannot
experiment with virtually all of these specifications.  If you want to build
a HeNe laser with a longer or narrower bore or with a large 'can' style cold
cathode instead of a neon sign electrode - go for it!  Boosting power output,
in particular, may be quite viable especially for the pulsed lasers like the
Ar ion and CuCl/CuBr with a more sophisticated power supply and additional
(e.g., water) cooling.
<p>
Duplicating (or improving on) a known commercial design rather than one from a
20+ year old article could very well result in higher efficiency and output
power and better beam quality.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnchn5">Sam's Three Part Process for Getting Your Feet
Wet in Gas Lasers</A> for one possible approach to this.

<h3><A NAME="cltcwltb">Which Laser to Build?</A></h3>

A variety of factors should be considered in determining which of the many
possible lasers to undertake.  In addition to difficulty, there are other
personal factors such as the desire for a visible CW or pulsed beam or high
enough power to be used for wood or metal working (e.g., CO2 or ruby/Nd:YAG).

<ul>
<li>Although the helium-neon (HeNe) and argon/krypton (Ar/Kr) ion lasers are
 relatively simple in basic structure, they have some of the most stringent
 requirements on vacuum, gas purity and the need to minimize contaminants in
 the tube and vacuum system, and the need for precise pressure control.  I
 would also advise against the copper chloride and copper bromide lasers since
 they are more complex in a couple of areas (the need for a heater and the
 double pulse power supply).
<p>
<li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers really want to work - there is a wide variation
 of design, operating pressure, gas fill, and power supply that will result in
 a functioning laser (even if not quite optimal).  The beam is high power but
 invisible.
<p>
<li>A nice compromise might be had in the Pulsed Multiple Gas (PMG) laser since
 it can use a variety of gases and operates flowing gas mode which simplifies
 the vacuum requirements.
<p>
<li>The helium-mercury (HeHg) laser is another one that is relatively easy
 in terms of glass working, vacuum system, chemicals, and power supply
 requirements.
<p>
<li>The nitrogen (N2) laser is probably the easiest to build, can be used to
 pump the dye laser, and has minimal risks.  So, one could build the N2 laser
 and then the dye laser and compare pumping methods!  But, like that of the CO2
 laser, its beam is invisible - UV in this case.  It is also not very well
 collimated so optical manipulations are problematic.
<p>
<li>Although the Pulsed Solid State (PSS) and Diode Pumped Solid State (DPSS)
 laser may not quite have the attractive quality of being a truly from scratch
 project as is the case with the other home-built lasers, both types have
 their desirable attributes: a home-built PSS laser can easily produce
 hole blasting energy and a home-built DPSS laser with a frequency doubling
 crystal can produce the highest power visible (green) CW beam of any
 home-built laser.
</ul>
<p>
(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
My opinion and that of many other laser experimenters is that the home
construction of Ar/Krypton and HeNe lasers, requires much more critical
control, and generally it may lead to a laser that will never produce a beam
(but the educational experience is very valuable).
<p>
Also, Argon and Helium Neon lasers are very cheap, and quite common, so when
you compare the construction of these lasers with the purchasing them from
surplus market, its more cost effective to just purchase a commercial argon
ion or HeNe laser tube (and build your own resonator and power supply if
you like).
<p>
I would suggest building a laser that is not as readily available, and the cost
of such systems are very high - it's a great feeling to have built a laser
that is worth tens of thousands of dollars, yet only have spent a few hundred
dollars.
<p>
The lasers that are a good for construction are:
<ul>
<li>Copper Vapor - Nice yellow/green output - output powers in the range of
 10 watts or more.  (The copper halide lasers are easier to build though).
<p>
<li>Mercury Vapor - Blue Output, quit easy to build, but cavity optics can
 be a problem.  Although argon or 'white light' ion optics may be usable,
 obtaining these of sufficient diameter for the wide bore will be expensive
 unless you get lucky.
<p>
<li>Carbon Dioxide - The workhorse of lasers - very easy to build, high power.
  Variations on the cavity design also can be a good challenging project.
<p
><li>Nitrogen Laser - Very easy to build, High Power UV pulses great for
 pumping a dye laser.
<p>
<li>Dye Laser - Fairly easy to build, tunable across many colours.
<p>
<li>Ruby Laser - The laser that started it all - deep red output, able to
 be Q-switched, high power, pulses.
<p>
<li>Nd:YAG - Similar to the ruby, can be frequency doubled into the green
 spectrum (532 nm) and can be pumped by high power laser diodes.
</ul>
These are just some of the possible lasers that can be built by the
dedicated laser experimenter.

<h3><A NAME="cltccust">Can I Use the Same Tube for Multiple Home-Built
 Lasers?</A></h3>

There is a great amount of similarity between some of the home-built lasers
described in subsequent chapters as well as with variations on these which
aren't dealt with explicitly (e.g., HeHg and HeCd).
<p>
However, there are enough differences that for most of these home-built lasers,
it doesn't make sense to do this.  Even between, say the HeNe and Ar/Kr ion
lasers, the Brewster angle and bore diameters differ somewhat.  The CO2 laser
uses a wide bore and internal mirrors while the HeHg uses a wide bore but
external mirrors.  The electrode requirements differ as well.  Finally, some
of the materials - like mercury - will contaminate the glass and metal parts
of the tube and vacuum system so attempting to reuse a tube with a different
gas-fill may be counterproductive.  However, if you really want to try it,
see the section: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concueg">Comments on a Universal
Experimenter's Gas Laser</A>.
<p>
Here are some additional comments specifically for the CO2 laser versus the
others:
<p>
(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the same tube for the CO2 and HeNe or
argon/krypton ion lasers:
<ul>
<li>Flowing gas CO2 lasers use a large diameter bore typically 10 to 20 mm.
<li>Argon/krypton ion and HeNe lasers use fine diameter bores in the
vicinity of 0.5 - 1.5 mm.
</ul>
Also these lasers are much more critical in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Vacuum - A decent vacuum system is required, typically a 2 stage rotary
 vain pump is used as a roughing pump, with second diffusion pump to
 remove air that the rotary pump will not. In all cases ANY residual air
 left in the laser tube is detrimental to laser operation - it is also a
 major cause for the laser not to work
<p>
<li>Gas fill - The Gas used in these lasers must be very pure - in the vicinity
 of 99.999% pure - again, any traces of contaminants in the gas is
 detrimental.
<p>
<li>Gas Pressure; Gas pressure in these lasers must also be precisely
 controlled.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="cltcit2">Estimate of Home-Built Laser Output Power</A></h3>

None of the articles in "Light and its Uses" ever list the output power of the
home-built lasers.  This isn't surprising given the era (1960s for this one)
and even the present high cost of laser power meters (see the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm0">What
Makes a Laser Power Meter So Expensive?</A>.
<p>
Where possible, an attempt will be made to estimate the expected power (or at
least an upper bound) based on tube dimensions, power supply, and other
factors.  At best this will be a wild guess but may provide some indication of
the possibilities for improvement by tweaking the design.
<p>
Note that this also means that it is NOT possible to determine the laser
safety classification for these lasers.  They maybe of very low power but this
is not guaranteed.  So, treat their output as at least Class IIIb (Class IV
for the CO2 laser) until you can be sure that it isn't!

<h3><A NAME="cltalt">So, Maybe Constructing a Laser from Basic Elements Isn't
 for You?</A></h3>

If you're still not sure which laser to build - or whether building a laser
from scratch is for you at all, consider using a commercial HeNe or argon ion
tube with one or two Brewster windows and constructing a resonator including
mirror mounts.  This will give you a feel as to whether dealing with
metalworking and precision optics is something you enjoy without having to
invest in a vacuum system, and obtain weird gases and other supplies.  The
power supply can be built or bought as desired.  You will still have to fight
with mirror alignment and can gain access to the inside of the laser cavity
for experiments   And, perhaps most important, you can really impress your
friends with a way-cool high-tech looking laser. :)
<p>
I would definitely recommend the HeNe over the argon ion laser tube as it is a
<b>lot</b> easier and cheaper to build or buy a suitable power supply - and
somewhat safer as well.  Somehow, working around high voltage but low current
of a HeNe laser just seems to me to be much less scary than being in close
proximity to the non-isolated AC line voltage at many amps (and killer fan)
of an ion laser!
<p>
A little searching of the laser surplus places should turn up an inexpensive
HeNe laser tube of this type (you may have to ask explicitly - they never seem
to be in the catalogs but usually lurk on a forgotten shelf in a rear storage
room on the second level sub-basement. :)
<p>
See the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnchn9">The Half-Way
Approach for a Home-Built HeNe Laser</A> and <A HREF="laserhen.htm#henoneb">A
One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube</A>.
<p>
There are other alternatives in between this approach and a full-blown from
beach sand up laser project.  See the additional information in the chapters
on the home-built HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers.
<p>
Solid state lasers are inherently of the "half-way approach" type since you
can't grow, shape, grind, and polish your own laser crystals; or build
flashlamps or laser diodes.  Yet, they have many attractive qualities.  Pulsed
SS lasers can generate the highest pulsed power of any home-built laser and
diode pumped SS lasers have the ability to generate high green CW power.
Parts are becoming more readily available at attractive prices and with
reasonable precautions and awareness of the safety issues, the risks
are relatively low and the chances of a successful outcome are quite high.

<h2>Scientific American Articles on Lasers and Related Topics</h2>

The laser construction articles from the Scientific American "Amateur
Scientist" columns (most of which were subsequently reprinted in the
collection "Light and its Uses") still represent the best source of
information of its type available to the hobbyist and experimenter.  While
research and technical papers may exist on these topics, access to them is
often non-existent to common people and/or they are written at such a level
as to be of minimal value to anyone who isn't an expert in the field.
<p>
Here is a list of some of the laser articles that have been published in the
Amateur Scientist columns of Scientific American.  The first 7 of these
constitute the chapters on laser construction found in "Light and its Uses":
<p>
<ol>
<li>Helium-Neon Laser, September, 1964, pg. 227.
<li>More on the Helium-Neon Laser, December, 1965, pg. 106.
<li>Argon Ion Laser, February, 1969, pg. 118.
<li>Tunable Dye Laser, February, 1970, pg. 116.
<li>Carbon Dioxide Laser, September, 1971, pg. 218.
<li>Infrared Diode Laser, March, 1973, pg. 114.
<li>Nitrogen Laser, June, 1974, pg. 122.
<li>Mercury-Vapor Ion Laser, October, 1980, pg. 204.
<li>Copper Chloride Laser, April, 1990, pg. 114.
</ol>
<p>
Except for the one in (6) which for all practical purposes you can ignore,
all the others are built from the ground up using basic materials like glass
tubing, pieces of plastic and metal, mirrors and other optics, glue, duct
tape, various bottled gases and other chemical supplies, high voltage
transformers, resistors, capacitors, diodes, wire, etc., along with blood,
sweat, and possibly some tears. :)
(The article in (6) deals with driving a long obsolete type of IR laser
diode which had limited applications.  However, modern equivalents do still
exist.  See the section: <A HREF="laserdio.htm#diocss7b">And Those High Power
Pulsed Laser Diodes?</A> if interested.)
<p>
In addition to actual laser construction, there have also been related
articles on vacuum systems, glass working, and other laser related
subjects, particularly during the initial laser craze of the 1960s and
1970s but extending to the present particularly for more exotic types of
lasers and laser applications including holography and interferometry.
<p>
As an aside, I lament the fact that few of the more recent Amateur Scientist
columns have nearly as much sophistication and depth as those from that era.
On the other hand, experiments that are presented may be performed by nearly
anyone who is reasonably handy using parts from the local home center and
Radio Shack and yet this is definitely real science.  There is no need for
high vacuum systems, glass working skills, strange gas mixtures and other
chemicals, or fancy test equipment!
<p>
A large public or university library will likely have all of these somewhere
though you may have to request them from their storage vaults and/or they may
be on microfilm or microfiche.  While the
<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/">Scientific American</A> Web site has many
interesting articles, they do not go far enough back to be of much
use for laser construction.  For possible Web access, see the section:
<A HREF="laserclt.htm#cltsal">On-Line Access to the Scientific American Laser
Articles</A>.
<p>
Specifically for laser construction and optics articles,
see the sections: <A HREF="laserclt.htm#cltlau">Light and its Uses - Complete
Table of Contents</A>.  However, the more general indexes may be more useful
since they also list project articles in related fields like vacuum systems
and electronics.  The book "Light and its Uses" is long out of print but your
library may have this as well (in its ancient not-that-popular books
collection!).  It may also be possible to obtain a copy from a dealer in used
scientific books.  Although Internet companies like
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</A> offer to attempt to find
such books, going to a more specialized search site like:
<A HREF="http://www.bibliofind.com/">Bibliofind</A> (which appears to be owned
by Amazon.com now) may be more productive.  They claim to have access to "ten
million used and rare books, periodicals and ephemera offered for sale by
thousands of booksellers around the world".  I have heard of this being a
successful means of obtaining "Light and its Uses".

<h3><A NAME="cltsal">On-Line Access to the Scientific American Laser
 Articles</A></h3>

In the age of electronic access, it would obviously be desirable to be able
to browse articles from Scientific American on-line.  While the
<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/">Scientific American</A> Web site has many
interesting articles, they do not go far enough back to be of much use for
laser construction and apparently have little interest in out-of-print
material.  I have attempted to obtain permission from Scientific American to
provide the chapters on laser construction in "Light and its Uses" on-line.
Unfortunately, the editors of Scientific American have denied my request.
I had even offered to scan and OCR the originals and have Scientific
American maintain the resulting documents SOLELY at THEIR Web site - yet they
still refused! "For policy reasons", they said.  Probably too many layers :-(.
Since I will not knowingly violate someone else's copyright, that's as far as
it goes - here.  Sorry.

<h3><A NAME="cltcdr">CDROM with the SciAm Amateur Scientist Archive</A></h3>

Dr. Shawn Carlson, author of the final six years of the Amateur Scientist
sells the CDROM of the entire 70 year run of Scientific American's "The
Amateur Scientist" column.  Check out
<A HREF="http://www.brightscience.com/">The Amateur Scientist CDROM
Web Site</A>.  This is
your chance to obtain everything on lasers from "Light and its Uses" as well
as the articles that followed, vacuum systems, high voltage, and much much
more. A CDROM is now available with all of the articles since the 1920s
scanned, OCR'd and converted to HTML, complete with high
resolution images of the illustrations, searchable, and
indexed.  There are also 100s of other articles included.
Some of the sales pitch on the Web page, above, sounds like it's more
geared to selling Choppomatics on late night TV, but this is the real deal.
Even if you're not interested
in the CDROM, his Web site is something to behold.
<p>
This appears to be the only source for an electronic version of the
Amateur Scientist articles at the present time.  There were
a couple of others but they have disappeared.  Of course, you could go to
a real library.  What a concept? :)

<h3><A NAME="cltlau">Light and its Uses - Complete Table of Contents</A></h3>

Even after more than 20 years, "Light and its Uses" is considered to be THE
reference for amateur laser construction.  However, it is easy to overlook the
many other excellent projects contained in this work.  They are probably of
even more value overall because fabrication of most of the optical instruments
is less demanding in some ways than the lasers since no vacuums, or messy or
toxic chemicals are required and light sources and readily available low cost
lasers other than those from the construction articles can be used.
