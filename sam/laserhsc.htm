<h2>Schematics for Power Supplies of All Sizes</h2>

This chapter provides a variety of circuits of both line powered and inverter
types for the basic power supply, some with regulators, modulation inputs, and
other goodies.  Several have been reverse engineered from actual working
commercial products.  Some of these have been modified or enhanced to provide
additional capabilities like current sensing or modulation.  I have designed
(and in most cases, constructed and tested as well) the others (those with
names starting with "Sam's") for various power ratings and capabilities using
commonly available parts in most cases.
<p>
This collection includes power supplies suitable for almost any HeNe tube or
laser head with an optical output power from .5 to 35 mW - and beyond.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscitr0">HeNe Laser Power Supply Selection
Guide</A> to identify the one (or more!) that may be most suitable for your
collection of HeNe tubes as-is or with minor modifications.  And, most of these
circuits can be easily modified for your specific needs: For example, a very
high power HeNe tube or a weird laser requiring multiple power supply feeds
and separate starters
<p>
CAUTION: Although not explicitly shown in some schematics, accessible parts
of the power supply and laser head should be connected to earth ground via
a three-prong power cord.  This protects against a dangerous shock hazard
should there be a fault condition and also eliminates any possibility
of even a slight tingle due to capacitive coupling of high voltages.  Where such
a problem is detected with an existing power supply, there is likely an insulation
or wiring problem in either the supply or laser head which should be corrected.
If a ground is simply added to the laser head case, the power supply may fail due
to a problem elsewhere.
<p>
CAUTION: Where a ground was not shown on some of the commercial HeNe laser power
supplies, its schematic may show one in the logical place assuming an Alden-type
(2 wire) connection to the laser head.  However, a few commercial power supplies
used 3 wires with a separate ground.
<p>
WARNING: There are so many complete HeNe laser power supply schematics in this
one document that their combined mass may cause a singularity to form inside
your computer. :-)  The lawyers made me include this statement - honest. ;-)
<p>
Note: For an explanation of the meanings of various designations like X, Y,
HV+, Tube-, etc., used in these schematics, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdacl2">Notation used in HeNe Laser Power Power Supply
Diagrams and Schematics</A>.

<h3><A NAME="hscitr0">HeNe Laser Power Supply Selection Guide</A></h3>

The chart below lists each of the power supplies for which there are
schematics along with the approximate range of HeNe tube output power
that it can handled by that design without modification.  In most cases,
higher or lower wattage HeNe tubes can be accommodated by scaling the component
values (e.g., transformer, capacitor, and diode voltage ratings).  Since the
actual voltage and current can vary quite a bit among different model HeNe
tubes even if they are rated at the same output power, use this only as a
guide - check the specifications of your tube(s) before buying or building
anything!  The following summary is listed in the order of their appearance
(more or less).  Note that the maximum power output in the table below is
based on the original circuit, not on any possible modifications that might
be suggested.  And the minimum power output, especially for switchmode types,
can generally go much lower by reducing the input voltage.

Notes:
<ol>
<li>A link to the schematics for each power supply may be found in this
 chapter's <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Sub-Table of Contents</A>.
<p>
<li>Power Input: AC means 115 VAC (230 VAC by jumpering the primary of the
 power transformer in some cases).  DC may be anywhere from 6 to 15 VDC or more
 depending on the particular design and/or HeNe tube.  Actual power supply
 type may be either transformer/rectifier/filter or high frequency inverter.
<p>
<li>Regulation (if implemented): L = Linear, S = Switchmode (PWM), D = Driver
 side only.  Power supplies with L or S regulation should maintain the same
 output current with modest changes in input voltage, ballast resistance,
 and tube operating voltage.  For those without L or S regulation,
 adjusting the input voltage and/or selecting the value of the ballast
 resistance will change output current and can be used to set the output
 current over a fairly wide range.  Those with D regulation only should be
 tolerant of input variations but output current is not directly regulated
 so it will depend on the ballast resistance and tube characteristics.
<p>
<li>Modulation (if implemented): P = Simple on/off power switching, V =
 Variable audio and/or video rate modulation.  
<p>
<li>HeNe tube output power: Approximate range of tubes that may be driven by
 the particular power supply design WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS.  These are rough
 estimates due to both variability of HeNe tube requirements as well as
 uncertainty in the actual specifications, especially for many of the
 commercial power supplies.

<h2>Introduction to AC Line Operated Power Supply Schematics</h2>

Several of the circuits described in the following sections were reverse
engineered from commercial HeNe laser power supplies.  There may be errors in
transcription as well as interpretation.  In many cases, the transformer
secondary voltage was not marked and where the actual hardware was not
available for testing, an estimate of its value was made.  Within each
grouping, they are arranged roughly in order of increasing power (drive)
capability.
<p>
Many of these designs are quite old since modern commercial units tend toward
inverter designs since they can be more compact and have higher efficiency.
Unfortunately, modern inverter types are nearly always potted in Epoxy and
impossible to disassemble and analyze.  However, AC Line operated power
supplies will drive HeNe tubes just as well as fancy inverters and are
somewhat easier to construct and troubleshoot (especially for high power
designs).
<p>
The line side circuitry is not shown for any of these.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdacl4">AC Input Circuitry for HeNe Laser Power
Supplies</A> for details.
<p>
Those with "Sam's" in the title were built using mostly scrounged parts like
tube type TV power transformers that had been minding their own business in
various storage cabinets often for many many years.  My total cost for the
remaining components for each power supply was generally not over $5.

<h2>Commercial AC Line Operated Power Supplies</h2>

These were all reverse engineered from actual hardware or from (mostly poor)
photocopies of schematics.  Errors in transcription are quite possible.  Some,
like the Aerotech models, were apparently prototypes so they may not represent
what is - or was - actually out there.  In addition, design changes are quite
common with this sort of technology so even though the sample schematic has
a particular value - or even a particular circuit design - doesn't mean that
yours will be the same or even recognizable.
<p>
They are presented in approximate order of output capability which is why
the sequence of manufacturer and model number may appear somewhat random. :)

<h3>Edmund Scientific HeNe Laser Power Supply (ES-HL1)</h3>

There were some inconsistencies in the component values of this circuit when
I first saw it.  I have adjusted the RMS value of the transformer down from
710 to 650 VRMS so that the numbers work out closer to what one would expect.
<p>
Estimated specifications (ES-HL1):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,700 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 5,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulation.
</ul>
(Portions from: Steve Nosko (q10706@email.mot.com).)
<p>
This is the power supply I traced out and measured which is in an Edmund
Scientific 0.5 mw. Laser circa probably around 1975.  I bought a 1 mW. tube
(1986) when the old one broke.  It is still running just fine.  I think it
is a rather clever design and I don't think they come any simpler.

</PRE>
Note that there are no equalizing resistors across the 1N4007s.  While I have
been building similar supplies without them, the use of 10M resistors across
each diode to equalize the voltage drops is recommended.
<p>
The 650 V transformer output feeds a voltage doubler (D1 and D2 and C8 to C11)
resulting in about 1,750 V across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than
2 times the peak value of 650 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of D7
to D12 and C5 through C7 generates up to 6 times the transformer's peak
voltage or around 5,300 V (the actual value will depend on various factors
including stray capacitance and other losses).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a
description of its design and operation.
<p>
The 150K ballast resistor is actually constructed from 4 - 33K resistors
and one 18K resistor in series.  It doesn't have to be, but this is convenient
and allows the ballast to be changed easily (or just tap off the appropriate
point for your tube.  My notes show 600 V across the ballast resistor-combo.
<p>
The ballast resistor should be located close to the tube with as short a lead
as possible and as little capacitance to surroundings as possible.  The tube
needs to see a high impedance source.  This isn't super critical, but keep the
wire down to 1 to 3 inches and the first few resistors away from any case or
ground material. 
<p>
Since there is no active regulator, the tube current will depend on the power
line voltage and other factors like temperature.  However, the relatively large
ballast resistor in this power supply should minimize excessive variation.
<p>
There is also a GAMMEX HeNe laser power supply that appears virtually
identical to this one.  I don't have a sample but from a photo of the circuit
board, the only obvious difference would appear to be the use of 6, 27K,
2 W resistors for the ballast.  All the other parts and even the part values
appear identical.  So GAMMEX probably copied the circuit and adjusted the
value of the ballast resistance until the desired current was obtained. :)

<h3>Laboratory for Science Model 200 Laser Power Supply (LS-200)</h2>

This is an AC line power supply with additional filtering on the positive
side (apparently as an afterthought) and a linear regulator.  The
negative portion of the supply would seem to have the same issues, but
perhaps there was simply no room!  The reverse engineered schematic may be

<h3>Laboratory for Science Model 220 Laser Power Supply (LS-220)</h2>

This is the low noise power supply found in the Laboratory for Science model
220 Ultra Stable HeNe laser.  It is supposed to have less than 1 mV ripple
on the high voltage.
<p>
This diagram is not yet complete in the area of the control circuit in the
lower right corner since it is difficult to trace it without removing the PCB.
In particular, there are at least two tantalum caps and other components which
contribute to the low noise performance.
<p>
The secondary voltage of T1 was guessed. :)  There were no part numbers on the
PCB so these are arbitrary.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube and its ballast resistor are not shown here.  The ballast
is a single 7 or 10 W resistor mounted on standoffs in the laser head.  But
there is also a thermal regulator in series with the anode of the tube.
It implements a closed-loop feedback scheme using only the anode current
with no other connections to stabilize the temperature of the OC mirror.

<h3>Metrologic Model 360 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-360)</h3>

The Metrologic model 360 HeNe laser could easily win the "clunky laser of
the year award". :)  It is a very basic 1 mW or so laser in a very ugly
rectangular extruded aluminum case.  Photos of the laser and power supply can
be found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
under "Metrologic Helium-Neon Lasers".  (There may be slight or not so
slight variations depending on revision level and the specific HeNe tube
actually installed.  The sample I have actually has a slightly more modern
soft-seal Hughes style tube.)
<p>
Estimated specifications (ML-360):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,700 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 5,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulation.
</ul>
<p>
This power supply is almost identical to the ES-HL1, above, and may indeed
just be a variation on it since Edmund Scientific very likely sold Metrologic
lasers or clones under their own brand name.
<p>
I replaced the original quite dead soft-seal HeNe tube with a Uniphase 098-2
which is rated at 2 mW so the output is probably twice that of the original
laser.  No changes were required to satisfy the 4.5 to 5 mA current
recommended for the 098-2.  The set of ballast resistors is way overdesigned,
power-wise, so there should be no problem with overheating.  The only thing
marginal may be the starting voltage but the 098-2 starts instantly.

<p>
Note that there are no equalizing resistors across the 1N4007s.  While I have
been building similar supplies without them, the use of 10M resistors across
each diode to equalize the voltage drops is recommended.
<p>
Also, the measured voltage across the filter capacitors exceeds their 450 VDC
ratings until the laser tube starts, and then drops down a bit.  But that
is still beyond marginal in my book.  Slight differences in the equalizing
resistor values and/or leakage of the caps could result in a mess.  Having
said that, I haven't seen any of these with blown caps.
<p>
The only notable difference between ML-360 and ES-HL1 is that the starting
voltage is fed to the anode of the HeNe tube via a set of blocking diodes
in parallel rather than the more common series arrangement.
<p>
I was given another nearly identical power supply with the only difference
being that there were only 2 diodes in series instead of 3 diodes for each
stage of the voltage multiplier.  I do not know what laser this came from.

<h3>Metrologic Model ML620 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-620)</h3>

This is the power supply for the Metrologic model 620 HeNe laser, rated
about 0.8 mW.  It is a basic line operated doubler and parasitic
multiplier design with series linear regulator similar to many other
small HeNe power supplies.
<p>
Estimated specifications (ML-620):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,700 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 to 6 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 6,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 1,200 to 1,500 V at top of ballast resistor.
</ul>

</ul>
<p>
I haven't been able to locate cross references for the ITT992 diodes and
M639 transistors but would expext that 1N4007s and MJE3439s would be
satisfactory substitutes.
<p>
The factory setting for HeNe tube current is about 4.5 mA.  However,
this can be adjusted by changing the value of R5 or R6.  It works nicely
with the typical 6" long 0.5 to 1.5 mW barcode scanner HeNe laser tube
as a replacement since in all likelihood the original soft-seal tube will
be very dead in any sample you acquire.  However, the value of R5 or R6
may need to be changed to set the current at the optimal value for the
replacement tube to maximize output power and tube life.  Typical 6"
tubes only require 3 to 3.5 mA.

<h3>Metrologic Model 420 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-420)</h3>

This laser uses the same transformer as the ML-360, above.  But the HV
circuitry is totally different and, well, strange! :)  It's not a doubler,
a bridge, a half wave rectifier, or full-wave rectifier.

<h3>Metrologic Model ML660 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-660)</h3>

This is another small Metrologic laser with an outpout in the 1 to 1.5 mW
range.  It has a linear power supply with 2 transistor regulator (unlike
newer models which use high frequency inverters).

<h3>Metrologic Model ML920 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-920)</h3>

This probably was a 2 to 3 mW laser based on the power supply output and
the length of the very dead in the unit I tested.  But even the company
who now has the Metrologic laser product line has never heard of the
ML-920!

<li>Operating voltage: 2,500 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 mA.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 130 HeNe Laser Power Supply (SP-130)</A></h3>

This is the power supply which is used in the Spectra-Physics model 130 and
130B lasers.  I suppose I should say 'was used' as these date from 1965!
A description and photos of this laser can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp130">Description of the SP-130 Laser</A>.
<p>
A transformer feeds a voltage doubler with a CRC filter, ballast resistors,
and not much else except a power rheostat in the primary to adjust tube
current.

You're probably wondering about the lack of starting circuitry.  Well, there
is none!  The power transformer (T101) is probably similar to a neon sign or
oil burner ignition type with a quasi-constant current/high droop output.  The
open circuit doubled/filtered output voltage is about 5,000 VDC which is
sufficient to start the wide bore (2.5 mm) HeNe tube.  When the tube starts
and draws current, the output voltage drops down to about 1,500 VDC.  T101,
in conjunction with R101 (Current Adjust) in the primary, the Rs in the CRC
filter, and large ballast resistance, limits the current to between 6 and 11
mA (depending on the setting of the R101).
<p>
The laser could be jumpered for either 115 VAC or 230 VAC using dual primaries
on T101 (not shown).  The only other change would be to use a 0.75 A fuse
instead of the 1.5 A fuse.
<p>
It appears as though the original SP-130 used a hot cathode powered from a
filament transformer (T102, 2.5 VAC, 6 A - not shown).  However, the SP-130B
tube had a more modern hollow aluminum cathode.  Where the tube was replaced
in an SP-130 (quite likely as they didn't last as long as modern ones), the
newer style was probably installed.  Samples of the SP-130B I've seen appear to
still include T102 and its wiring even though they didn't have the hot cathode
type tube.
<p>
T101 and all the HV circuitry are in separate potted blocks - there is no
chance of disassembly should something fail.  However, these appear to be
extremely reliable (which is more than can be said of the laser tube!).
Everything else (F101, S101, R101, T102, etc.) are accessible.  The SP-233
exciter for the SP-133 laser head may be similar as it also has potted blocks
for the power transformer and HV circuitry (but lacks T102 and R101).
<p>
Note that the starting voltage of 5 KV is marginal for all but the smallest
modern narrow bore HeNe tubes.  I have tested it with the SP-084-1 HeNe tube
as well as other lower power barcode scanner HeNe tubes.  While these did
start and run reliably, 200K or more <i>additional</i> ballast resistance was
required to reduce the current to their optimum operating range of 4 to 6.5 mA.
I expect that the SP-130 power supply would not be able to start larger HeNe
tubes (or hard-to-start smaller ones) at all even though its operating voltage
and current might be adequate.  Therefore, with so many more capable
alternatives, it's probably not a good choice to build unless you happen
to have an SP-130 laser tube laying around the house. :)

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 132/132M HeNe Laser Power Supply (SP-132)</A></h3>

This is a 1 mW self contained HeNe laser.  The power supply is very simple
with no regulation - just a doubler for the operating voltage and a 3 stage
multiplier for the starting voltage.  The very large total ballast resistance
of 272K (4 times 68K) stabilizes the HeNe tube current somewhat without an
active regulator but wastes some extra power.
<p>
I have tried a few modern HeNe laser tubes in place of the original.  Long
(i.e., 10") 1 to 2 mW tubes seem to start reliably but tend to run at higher
than desirable operating current at normal line voltage.  For example, a
Uniphase 098 that should get 3.7 mA runs at 6.5 mA and the 098-2
runs at 5.5 mA.  So, additional ballast resistance would need to be added
to use a replacement tube, probably better to do it in the cathode
return.  Very roughly, 100K ohms will reduce the current by 1 to 2 mA.
On a Variac, the current could be set to the proper value.
For unknown reasons, some shorter tubes would not start reliably at all,
possibly related to the very high power supply ballast resistance and
relatively long wire length to the tube anode.
<p>
The only reason the diagram looks a bit different than the others is that I
didn't want to wasts a lot of page space with not much stuff. :)

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 155 HeNe Laser Power Supply (SP-155)</h3>

The SP-155 laser is a self contained unit with a rated power of 0.5 mW.  It
apparently was a very popular laser for education and used a soft-seal HeNe
tube.  Although quite old (the manual I have dates to 1977), many of these
are still operational.  I have a sample from 1982 and while not quite up to
spec (it outputs about 0.3 mW), still operates quite happily. :)
<p>
Note that other manufacturers sell (or have sold) lasers identical in
appearance to the SP-155.  For example, there is a Uniphase model 155ASL-1
and a Liconix L-388 (even though it is made by Uniphase).  However, these
use a hard-seal Uniphase barcode scanner HeNe tube (similar to a model
098 with a tiny collimating lens glued to its OC to reduce divergence)
rather than the fancy Spectra-Physics side-arm tube we know and love.  But
their power supplies are similar or identical to that used in the SP-155 and
what follows should still apply.  (There is also a Spectra-Physics model 155ASL
which is physically identical to the Uniphase and Liconix lasers except for
the name on the front.  I assume it has the same construction though I
haven't seen the insides of one up close and personal.)
<p>
The power supply is a simple line operated design and includes a current
regulator which can easily be modified for any typical tube requirement.
It can also be converted to a modulator in a number of ways.
<p>
High voltage diodes and capacitors are used in this design.  An alternative
is to use inexpensive 6 - 1,000 V diodes for each 6 kV diode shown here, and
to use 6 - 0.003 uF, 1 kV capacitors in series for each 6 kV capacitor.  I
would recommend 10 M ohm equalizing resistors across each lower voltage
device though for the diodes at least, this appears not to be essential.
<p>
I include two schematics below.  The first one is from an unidentified source
and the second is directly from an early SP-155 operation and service manual.
The specs should be identical but the component changes indicate possible
improvements in reliability and stability.
<p>
Estimated specifications (SP-155, circuit 1):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,700 V.
<li>Operating current: 3.75 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 5,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 1,400 to 1,700 V at top of ballast resistor.

<p>
Note: Some versions of this unit may have only 3 main filter caps and slightly
different components values but are otherwise similar.
<p>
The 1,245 V transformer output feeds a half wave rectifier (CR100) and filter
resulting in about 1,700 V across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than
the peak value of 1,245 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of CR101 to
CR103 and C100 through C103 generates up to 3 times the transformer's peak
voltage or around 5,100 V (the actual value will depend on various factors
including stray capacitance and other losses).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a
description of its design and operation.
<p>
Q100, CR104, and R106 form a constant current regulator which will attempt
to maintain the tube current at (Vz - .7)/R106 or about 3.75 mA in this case.
Its compliance range is about 300 V.  This can easily be adapted to your
requirements by either changing CR104 or R106 appropriately.
<p>
The anode ballast resistor, Rba, needs to be large enough to maintain stability
(usuall this means at least 75K-33K=42K or so in this case) and should be as
close to the HeNe tube as possible.  (The original schematic doesn't have
anything for Rba though.)  Commercial laser heads generally include an
internal 75K ballast resister.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for
more information.

<p>
Instead of a zener diode, a resistor is used for setting the current.  However,
this doesn't any line regulation.  Cost cutting?  The operating current is also
much higher than in the previous circuit - 6 mA instead of 3.7 mA (I measured
it to confirm - approximately 42 V across R105!).  So, perhaps this version
of the SP-155 uses a higher current HeNe laser tube.
<p>
Also, if theres a problem with the circuit and/or the tube doesn't start,
it would appear that the voltage
on the filter capacitors (C103-C105) may exceed 1,500 V since the
transformer will be lightly loaded.  Even if perfectly balanced, the voltages
on each could then exceed 500 V.  Not good.  So, someone redesigned the
circuit and eliminated one of the filter capacitors but forgot about
their voltage ratings.  Apparently, the filter capacitorss in these things
have been known to blow up. :)
<p>
In neither schematic is Tube- tied to ground which is fine since the tube is
enclosed in the grounded metal case and both connections are fully insulated.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 233 Exciter (SP-233)</h3>

This unit is physically identical to the SP-235 exciter described in the
next section.  It appears to be almost the same electrically as well but
is designed for a somewhat lower power laser, about 2 mW.
The known differences visible without ripping the potted module apart
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>R112 through R115: 50K instead of 35K.
<li>Transformer part number: 404-662B 23120 (1,300 VRMS) instead
 of 0406-7330-4 114-P-7 23316 (1,400 VRMS).
</ul>
<p>
There is also an SP-133M, which is mutli-spatial mode with a lower tube voltage
and higher tube current.  The only difference in the power supply is that R113
is 30K instead of 50K for the SP-133M.
<p>
The resistors are probably all that differ as the additional 100K for the
four resistors in the SP-233 would result in the voltage to the tube being
about 600 V lower at 6 mA, which is consistent with a 2 mW versus a
5 mW laser.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 234 Laser Power Supply (SP-234)</h3>

This is a self contained laser physically identical to the SP-132, but rated
4 mW instead of 2 mW.  The power supply is also identical except for the
ballast resistors:
<p>
<ul>
<li>T1 is 1,400 VRMS instead of 1,300 VRMS.
<li>R111 is not present.
<li>R112 is 68K, 5 W.
<li>There are three additional ballast resistors closest to the laser tube
 anode, R115 through R117, which are 30K, 5 W.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 235 Exciter (SP-235)</h3>

The SP-235 Exciter is specifically designed for driving the Spectra-Physics
model 135 laser head but should be suitable for other medium size HeNe tubes
(probably around 3 to 5 mW) with a nominal discharge voltage of around 2,050 V
across the tube.  BTW, don't let the term 'exciter' get your juices flowing; SP
calls all their laser power supplies officially by that name.  It does sound
more impressive! :)
<p>
Note that the SP-235 and SP-233 exciters for the SP-135 and SP-133 lasers
are physically identical and both have a transformer feeding a potted module
with 4 ballast resistors in glass tubes but the part numbers of the
transformers are not the same and the values of the resistors
in the glass tubes differ as well.  The potted module has no part number so
I have no idea of whether it's the same.  See the previous section
for what is known, which isn't much. :)
<p>
There are two interesting things that differentiate this otherwise relatively
boring circuit and other typical power supplies in its class:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The SP-235 has no active regulator.  To reduce the effects of line and load
 variations on tube current, additional ballast resistors are included in the
 supply itself (R112 to R115).  While this does not provide anything close to
 true active regulation, it is better than nothing.  (The SP-130 and SP-233 use
 a similar approach.)  The sensitivity of tube current to line voltage
 fluctuations, for example, is about 50 uA/V - about 1/3 of what it would
 be with just the typical 75K ballast resistance.  Perhaps there was
 a regulator option that could be added in place of R112 to R115.
<p>
<li>The starter voltage multiplier is in two parts which are symmetrically
 divided between the positive and negative outputs of the power supply.  Why
 this was done is not known.  The only advantage would seem to be that the
 maximum voltage with respect to chassis ground is cut in half reducing
 insulation requirements.
</ol>
<p>
Estimated specifications (SP-235):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 2,550 V. 
<li>Operating current: 6 mA. 
<li>Starting voltage: around 8,500 V. 
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulation. 
</ul>

<p>
Note: Assuming the secondary components are isolated, the circuit is safe as
drawn but I have heard there may be some slight sensation of shock when
touching the laser head.  Thus, it would probably be a good idea to
connect the laser head case to earth ground via a three-prong power cord
if this is not already present.  However, it's also possible the shock is
due to insulation breakdown inside the head so check for this first as it
could damage the power supply with the additional ground connection (aside
from being a serious shock hazard).
<p>
With minor modifications, it should be possible to use this design for somewhat
larger HeNe tubes - possibly up to 7 to 10 mW - by removing one or more of the
in-board ballast resistors, R112 to R115.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 247 HeNe Laser Power Supply (SP-247)</h3>

This one appears to be capable of driving higher power tubes and to have a bit
more sophisticated constant current regulator with wider compliance than the
Model 155.  The Spectra-Physics brochure says it's designed for 4 to 5 mW
HeNe lasers.  The regulator is in the positive feed instead of the return but
otherwise, the basic power supply design is similar.
<p>
Estimated specifications (SP-247):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 3,200 V.
<li>Operating current: 2.3 to 10 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 10,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 2,200 to 3,200 V at top of ballast resistor.

(Note:  I originally had R14 and R10 being 120K and 48K, respectively.  But
inspecting an actual SP-247 shows 110K and 47K.  The difference isn't critical
in any case and it's quite possible both of these as well as other sets
of values were used.)
<p>
The 1,200 V transformer output feeds a voltage doubler consisting of rectifiers
CR1 and CR2 and filter capacitors C2 through C9 resulting in about 3,200 V
across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than 2 times the peak value of
1,200 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of CR3 to CR6 and C1 through
C10 generates slightly less than 6 times the transformer's peak voltage or
around 10,200 V.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage
Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a description of its design and operation.
<p>
C15 and C16 may provide some additional filtering to the output but any
real benefit is questionable since once the tube starts, the series diodes
of the multiplier (CR3-CR6) are forward biased with an essentially
constant voltage drop across them.  So, the main filter capacitor bank
(C2-C9) actually absorbs virtually all of the ripple from the starter.
<p>
Q1 through Q5, their associated resistors, and ZD1 (15 V zener) maintains a
constant voltage of 15 V across the combination of R16+R17 so the tube
current will be 15/(R16 + R17).  For example, with the R17 set for 1.5 K, the
tube current will be 5 mA.  The adjustment range is approximately 2.3 to 10 mA.
The voltage compliance range of this power supply should be over 1,000 V.
<p>
Q5 is forward biased by current flowing through R11-R14.  This maintains
a constant voltage drop of about 0.7 V between its base and emitter and a
nearly constant current through the zener (ZD1) consisting of 0.7/43K or
about 16 uA plus the base current needed to turn on the pass-bank string
(Q1-Q4) enough that there is a voltage drop across R16+R17 of 15 V.
Note that while all the current ends up flowing through the laser tube,
the current flowing through ZD1 will depend slightly on the voltage
across the pass-bank and the gain of Q5.  The current through ZD1,
perhaps 50 uA, is kept small for that reason, and assure that regulation
will be maintained at a low pass-bank voltage.  However, this can result
in significant zener-generated noise depending on the specific zener
diode used.  See the info on the SP-248, below.
<p>
Keep in mind that if you include this high side regulator, it must be insulated
to handle the full starting voltage.  An alternative that might be easier to
construct would be use this operating/starting voltage design but to substitute
a similar compliance low-side regulator.
<p>
The anode ballast resistor, Rba, needs to be large enough to maintain stability
(at least 75K - 40K = 35K or so in this case) and should be as close to the
HeNe tube as possible.  Commercial laser heads generally include an internal
75K ballast resister.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast
Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for more information.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 248 HeNe Laser Power Supply (SP-248)</h3>

The SP-248 appears to be very similar to the SP-247, above, with an almost
identical PCB, but is slightly lower power.  It has a 3 wire output cable
with a primary side interlock.  The Spectra-Physics brochure says it's
designed for 2 mW HeNe lasers.  I suspect the specifications below are
somewhat optimistic:
<p>
Estimated specifications (SP-248):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 2,500 V.
<li>Operating current: 2.3 to 10 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 8,000 V but see note below.
<li>Compliance range: 1,500 to 2,500 V at top of ballast resistor.

<p>
Note: Primary side interlock in laser head cable prevents power from being
applied unless HeNe laser tube is connected.  I guess the assumption is that
the tube will start at less than 6 kV evem though the starting voltage
could exceed 8 kV or else C17 may go BOOM!
However, based on tests I've run with one sample, C17 doesn't seem to be
bothered by a tube that doesn't start or is disconnected so I assume these
capacitors are very conservatively rated.
<p>
C18 and R18 seem to be an afterthought since they are not present in
the SP-247.  One possibility is that they assure the transistors turn
on immediately after the tube starts to allow for the small but
finite time required for the voltage across the zener to stabilize.
I assume that if this was not done, there may be a situation where
the voltage across the zener would be so low initially that that
transistors would attempt to hold off too great a voltage and could
blow at the instant the tube starts.  However, as noted, the otherwise very
similar SP-247 doesn't have this "feature".  But they also result in increased
gain at higher frequencies, which it would seem could be undesirable.
See the next section.
<p>
Some samples may have 120K for R11 through R14 instead of 82K, 33K
for R15 instead of 82K, and possibly some other minor differences
which don't affect the specifications in any significant way.
<p>
See the SP-247 info, above, for description of operation.

<h4><A NAME="hscspc1">Converting the SP-248 into a Low Ripple Protected HeNe Laser Power Supply</A></h4>

For some measurements, having as low a ripple as possible in the HeNe laser
tube current is essential.  One such measurement is comparing the optical
frequency of two lasers where even a small amount of ripple can modulate
the optical frequency by an annoyingly large amount.
The specific lasers which I was interested in are those from Hewlett
Packard (now Agilent) used for metrology in interferometer-based measurements.
The "yardstick" is the wavelength of the 633 nm light maintained to very
high precision - actually something more like 632.991372 nm.  And, of
course, wavelength is the optical frequency divided by the speed of light
in the medium in which the measurements are being made..
<p>
The HeNe laser power supplies that are built into these lasers are
really terrible with respect to current ripple.  They are switch-mode
inverters that run at approximately 40 kHz with a residual ripple of
about 3 percent p-p.  Couldn't HP/Agilent spend $10 more and have
decent filtering? :)  The deviation in optical frequency resulting from
this variation in tube current can be up to 1 MHz or more.  Now, this
is essentially irrelevant for the actual metrology
application - even 1 MHz of deviation is only about 0.002 parts-per-million
(ppm) compared to the optical frequency of 474 THz, and that's still below
the spec'd precision.  But in actually testing these lasers, eliminating
the ripple provides for a much cleaner heterodyne (beat) frequency display.
OK, so perhaps it's only NIST and me who might care!
<p>
These lasers run at 3.5 mA and under 2 kV so if anything, the SP-248 is a
bit overkill, but that provides additional headroom to add filtering.
But care does have to be taken to avoid over-stressing the regulator
pass-bank transistors.
<p>
The SP-248 is actually already very good in regard to ripple.
The high gain regulator pass-bank does an excellent job and in fact, it's
very difficult to even detect the residual ripple in the tube current.
The residual voltage ripple at the left end of R15 is about 400 mV p-p
which results in a current ripple of less than 4 uA p-p or about
0.1 percent.
<p>
Using a pair SP-248s in place of the original HeNe lsaer power supplies
in both lasers whose optical frequencies were being compared did clean
things up immensely.  However, to be absolutely sure, a second filter
capacitor bank of ten 33 uF, 450 V  capacitors with 470K ohm equalizing
resistors can be installed at the junction of CR3 and C10 separated from
the original filter capacitor bank by a 124K, 4 W resistor.  At 3.5 mW,
this should reduce the ripple from the doubler by a factor of at least 50.
<p>
At 3.5 mA, the additional series resistance will drop almost 700 V so the
pass-bank will only see about 500 V which is both adequate for regulation
and low enough to be comfortable for the transistors.
<p>
Prior to these modifications, the ripple before the regulator was around
20 V p-p.  Now it is less than 1/2 V p-p.  And the regulator is fully capable
of taking care of that! :)
<p>
Note that contrary to what might be expected,
there is virtually <i>no</i> residual ripple from the starter's
voltage multiplier.  Even though the impedance to the high voltage input
from the power transformer is only about 3.5M ohms.  The reason is that
after the tube starts, the series HV diodes are conducting and thus there
is a nearly fixed forward voltage drop across each one.  So, the main
filter capacitor bank effectively absorbs any current ripple from that
source and almost no added voltage ripple is added.  The only variation
will be due to the slope of the diode's V-I curve at the operating point.
Nearly all of the ripple current from the starter will flow through
the left-most HV diode of the multiplier (CR3) so that only its slope
matters and is likely to be less than 0.1 V/mA.  With the values of
R1 and C1 resulting in an impedance at 120 Hz of about 3.5M ohm,
there will coincidentally be about 1 mA of ripple current producing
less than 0.1 V p-p of ripple voltage from the starter.  Since this is
less than 1/3rd of the ripple voltage from the enhanced main filter
capacitor banks, even I won't worry about it.
<p>
Some people might have a fancy term (generally used by psychoanalysts!) to
describe such attention to ripple detail, but I just don't want it to
ever be an issue! :)
<p>
For more information on these sorts of measurements, see the sections:
<A HREF="laserlia.htm#liaint2f">Interferometers Using Two-Frequency Lasers</A>
and <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstish3">Hewlett-Packard/Agilent Stabilized
HeNe Lasers</A>.
<p>
The additional filter capacitor bank worked great.  Originally, it was
possible to measure ripple of about 400 mV p-p at the top of the laser
head ballast resistor, now it is essentially undetectable.  Of course,
the ripple in the tube current had already been too small to measure
as voltage across a 1K resistor, but calculations predict that it should
have dropped from 4 uV p-p to 80 nV p-p, about 0.002 percent.  I can
live with that. :-)
<p>
But something was peculiar about this SP-248 supply.  There was
a larger amount of random noise in the HV output at the top of the
laser head ballast resistor than I had expected - 100 mV p-p or so.
You say: "That's essentially nothing compared to 1 or 2 kV!".
But I'm not complaining too much about that, though if I can figure
out how to make it smaller, I will.  However, there were also
spikes in the output with an amplitude at least 10 times larger.
Interestingly, although the spikes appeared at random times, the
average rate of spiking was most severe when the voltage across
the pass-bank was low, and nearly disappeared when it was near
the upper limit.  I thought that perhaps I had damaged a component
in doing the modifications but then I recalled that it was behaving
a bit strangely before.  So, I checked 3 other SP-248s and they all
had noise with two being 6 times larger than this one.  However, none
of the others had the spikes.
<p>
All the SP-248s had the identical design and similar component values.
The noise (independent of the 120 Hz ripple)
ranged from 100 mV p-p to more than 300 mV p-p when driving
the same laser tube at the same current with the same (AC) input
voltage.  The amplitude depended primarily on which SP-248 was used.
The noise isn't an oscillation but pink noise with a wide
frequency range up to MHz.  And, it was present even if the
supply fed a resistor instead of the laser tube, so it wasn't
something from the plasma discharge feeding back into the regulator.
<p>
I finally tracked the spiking to the zener voltage reference, ZD1, after
observing that placing a capacitor across made the spikes wider.  Zener
diodes are often used as noise sources, but normally shouldn't generate
spikes, nor a high enough noise amplitude to produce the effects being
seen here.  Nonetheless, jumpering a lower voltage zener across the
original eliminated the spiking entirely as did substituting a variety
of other zeners.  So the spiking was probably generated by the
original zener when operating near its knee at low current (when the
voltage across the pass-bank is low).  I still need to replace the
zeners on those two SP-248s with the high noise levels to determine
if noisy zeners are to blame, which is what I expect.  I never
realized zeners could be so naughty near their knee.  I tested several
other zeners and voltage reference diodes with just a DC power supply
and current limiting resistor.  The garden-variety zeners all had
varying levels of noise, including spikes, over some range at low
current.  The zener pulled from the SP-248 was possibly the worst,
at over 600 mV p-p (across the zener with the DC supply), but not
by a large amount.  Lower voltage zeners
or voltage reference diodes had much less noise so I may go with
one of those if the regulation is decent.  Dropping the reference voltage
from 15 V down to 8 or 10 V would be acceptable.  But a 6.8 V
diode I tried was fine in the noise department but had poor regulation.
The point of maximum noise depends on the specific zener, the
current, and the circuit impedance, among other things.  So, even a mediocre
zener may be acceptable if the operating point is beyond the peak
of the noise.  But, it may be desirable to select a low noise
zener like a 1N4109 to achieve the best performance in these
supplies.  Also, the default circuit values run the zener at under
100 uA, rather low for some zeners.  Boosting this and accepting
a slight reduction in regulation may be worth it to reduce the noise.
<p>
Having said all this, all 4 SP-248s probably met performance specifications
as the noise, spikes and all, was still under 1 percent.  Consider yourself
lucky if you have a modern HeNe laser power supply that is as good!
<p>
Finally, I added protection circuits to both supplies to shut them down
if either the tube dropped out or the current exceeded the 3.5 mA set-point
by more than 0.5 mA, which might occur as a result of a regulator failure.
The protection circuit consists of a solid state relay held closed by
the tube current.  This is in parallel with a home-built SCR (a 2N3904
and 2N3906 back-to-back) that gets triggered by excessive current
(the voltage drop across the relay input and a pot for current set-point
adjustment).  A pushbutton bypasses the relay for starting.  The schematic
may be found in <A HREF="hpsprot1.gif">HeNe Laser PSU Protection Circuit 1</A>.

Power Supply (SP-247)</A>.  Of course, it is common knowledge that in the very
beginning, someone design *a* HeNe laser power supply and all the others been
copying ever since! :)
<p>
Estimated specifications (JD-PS1):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 3,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 5 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 8,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 2,200 to 3,000 V at top of ballast resistor.

<p>
The main difference between the SP-247 and JD-PS1 is with respect to the
location of the regulator: The SP-247 puts it in the anode circuit while
the JD-PS1 puts it in the cathode return.  The driver circuit for the cascade
is also slightly modified.  Note that either the anode nor cathode of the HeNe
tube is earth/safety ground in this supply!

<h3>Aerotech Model PS0 HeNe Laser Power Supply (AT-PS0)</h3>

This one is similar to the power supply used in some of Aerotech's smaller
self contained HeNe lasers.  It appears to be suitable for 0.5 to 1 mW tubes
and is almost identical to the model AT-PS1, below.  However, the AT-PS0
runs near the limit of its components while the AT-PS1 could be modified for
use with larger HeNe tubes by replacing just the power transformer since the
diodes and capacitors can handle 50 to 100 percent higher voltage.
<p>
(Model number PS0 is arbitrary.)
<p>
Estimated specifications (AT-PS0):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,800 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 8,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 1,550 to 1,800 V at top of ballast resistor.

<p>
The 700 V transformer output feeds a voltage doubler consisting of rectifiers
D1 and D2 and filter capacitors C8 through C11 resulting in about 1,800 V
across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than 2 times the peak value of
700 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of D3 to D9 and C1 through C8
generates up to 5 times the transformer's peak voltage or around 9,000 V (the
actual value will depend on various factors including stray capacitance and
other losses).  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage
Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a description of its design and operation.
<p>
Q1, ZD1, R7, and R8 form the low-side current regulator.  The tube current
will be (15-.7)/R8 or just about 4 mA.  So, for a different current, select
R11 to be 14.3/I.  R7 reduces the power dissipation in Q1 over the useful
voltage compliance range but will not prevent Q1 from blowing due to a
short circuit.
<p>
Since the voltage compliance range of this power supply is only around 250 V,
the ballast resistor will still need to be selected carefully to achieve stable
regulation for your particular tube.  See the sections beginning with:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf0">Selecting the Ballast Resistor</A> for further
info.
<p>
I acquired an Aerotech self-contained laser with a very similar power supply.
Aside from part numbering (which I bet Wes assigned arbitrarily), the filter
caps were 4.7 uF instead of 10 uF, and there were some other minor
differences in resistor values, including  the total ballast resistance,
which was about 78K made up of 3 resistors in series.  Amazingly, the
very old soft-seal HeNe laser tube still outputs over 1.1 mW after a tune-up,
which is probably near original condition.
It has Epoxy sealed mirrors at both ends - to the glass stem
at the HR-end and a Hughes-style mini mirror adjuster for the OC mirror.
But it still has a nice mostly shiny getter and probably was never run
very much.  The model/date sticker is missing so I don't know exactly
how old this laser is, but it's probably pre-1980.

<h3>Aerotech Model PS1 HeNe Laser Power Supply (AT-PS1)</h3>

This one appears to be suitable for higher power tubes but is running at
very conservative voltage levels with the transformer that is provided.  It
uses low-side regulation with a fixed output of about 2,000 V at 4 mA.

<li>Operating voltage: 2,000 V.

<p>
Note: the laser head itself may have an additional ballast resistor (not
shown).
<p>
The 750 V transformer output feeds a voltage doubler consisting of rectifiers
CR1 and CR2 and filter capacitors C1 through C8 resulting in about 2,000 V
across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than 2 times the peak value of
750 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of CR3 to CR9 and C9 through
C15 generates slightly less than 10 times the transformer's peak voltage or
around 10,000 V.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage
Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a description of its design and operation.
<p>
Q1, ZD1, R8, and R11 form the low-side current regulator.  The tube current
will be (15-.7)/R11 or just about 4 mA.  So, for a different current, select
R11 to be 14.3/I.
<p>
Since the voltage compliance range of this power supply is only around 500 V,
the ballast resistor will still need to be selected carefully to achieve stable
regulation for your particular tube.  See the sections beginning with:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf0">Selecting the Ballast Resistor</A> for further
info.
<p>
The anode ballast resistor, Rba, needs to be large enough to maintain stability
(at least 75K-47K=38K or so in this case) and should be as close to the HeNe
tube as possible.  Commercial laser heads generally include an internal 75K
ballast resister.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast
Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for more information.

<h4><A NAME="hscat11">Enhancements to AT-PS1</A></h4>

Since the component values are all quite conservative, it should be possible
to safely boost the output of this supply by driving it with a Variac that
will go to 140 VAC.  This will result in up to 2,400 VDC - enough to power
most laser tubes of up to 5 mW.
<p>
The modified circuit provides a current adjustment control, modulation input,
'Beam On' indicator, and tube current sense test points.  I have implemented
these changes to the Aerotech PS1 and installed the current adjust pot, jacks
for Ground/Test+, Test-, Signal in, and Signal ground, and the Beam On LED on
the power supply case.

Each of the new and improved features is described below:
<ul>
<li>To provide adjustable current, R11 is replaced with a fixed and variable
  resistor in series.  Using a 1.5K resistor and 5K potentiometer results in
  a current range of approximately 2.2 to 9.5 mA.  A heatsink should be used
  on Q1 as it may be dissipating up to 5 W at maximum current and maximum
  voltage (this power is higher for certain settings than in the original
  Aerotech design).
<p>
<li>The Beam On indicator (IL2) is a high brightness LED in series with the tube
  so it will glow whenever current is flowing.  Its brightness provides a rough
  indication of tube current as well.
<p>
<li>The test points permit the use of a multimeter to monitor beam current.
  Using a voltage setting, the sensitivity is 1 mA/V.  Current can also be
  monitored directly between the test points (the current in R13 will be
  negligible).  ZD2 protects the multimeter should the sense resistor go
  open-circuit for some reason :-(.
<p>
<li>The modulation input (Signal in) is coupled via T2, a small audio transformer
  to provide HV isolation and permit the Tube- terminal to be earth ground.
  The insulation rating on T2 should be at least 1,000 V.  Assuming a 1:1
  transformer, current sensitivity (percentage change of current with respect
  to voltage) is about 7%/V relative to the set-point.  The maximum input
  should be limited to about 14 V p-p which will result in a current between
  about 50% and 150% of the set-point.  Thus, adjust R12 for 67% of the nominal
  tube current with no signal.  If the tube goes out on the negative peaks,
  increase the set-point and decrease the amplitude of the input.
<p>
  The phone line coupling transformer from a long forgotten 2400 baud modem
  served nicely for this application resulting in a useful frequency response
  from about 100 and 10,000 Hz.
<p>
<li>Another desirable enhancement (not shown) would be to provide a selection
  of ballast resistor values in increments of 20K or 25K up to 150K.  In
  conjunction with the current control and optional Variac, this will provide
  additional flexibility in matching the tube, supply voltage, and modulation
  capabilities resulting in a 'universal' HeNe laser power supply.
</ul>
With a small HeNe tube requiring about 1,200 V at 4 mA and additional 33K 5 W
ballast resistor, it was possible to adjust/modulate the current between about
2 and 6 mA.  For testing, I used a Heathkit audio signal generator to drive
the modulation input and the simple circuit described in the section: <A HREF="laserdio.htm#diodct5">IR
Detector Circuit</A> with a scope across the C-E leads of the transistor as a
receiver.  While this IR detector design is not really very good for linear
operation, with a little care in positioning the photodiode with respect to
the beam reflected off of a piece of paper, it was possible to display the
received signal on an oscilloscope.  One could clearly observe the effects
of adjusting the current set-point and modulation signal amplitude and of
modulating beyond the rated tube current - the signal inverted (due to reduced
optical output power).
<p>
Stay tuned for exciting future developments!
<p>
A similar approach can be used with any of the other HeNe laser power supply
designs described in this document which use low-side regulation or which do
not have any regulation.
<p>
CAUTION: Don't try this with power supplies using high-side regulation either
by modifying the regulator (you would need a 15 kV coupling capacitor or 15 kV
opto-isolator to hold off the starting pulse) or adding an additional low-side
modulator (the two circuits will be fighting each other).

<h3>Aerotech Model PS2B HeNe Laser Power Supply (AT-PS2B)</h3>

This one is definitely for higher power tubes.  However, the basic design
is quite similar to those preceding.  The estimated operating voltage is
3,600 V at 5 to 9 mA with a starting voltage of over 15,000 V.  It includes
positive (anode) side regulation using an LM723 IC and a cascade of high
voltage transistors.
<p>
There may have been several versions of this model as I have two slightly
different samples using the same circuit board.  The one described below which
designate model PS2B uses the higher voltage tap on the transformer.  A nearly
identical design - model PS3A - runs with a transformer secondary of 1,150
VRMS yielding 3,000 VDC operating, 12,000 VDC starting, and uses only 8
electrolytic filter capacitors. 
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat4">Aerotech Model PS2A-X HeNe
Laser Power Supply (AT-PS2A-X)</A> for its circuit diagram with my
modifications.
<p>
It appears as though Aerotech may have relabeled this supply the PS7
at some point since I have one of those that appears virtually identical
both physically and electrically, or possibly at most, jumpered for the
higher output voltage tap on the transformer.  That would make sense since it
is suitable for HeNe laser heads of around 7 mW.
<p>
Estimated specifications (AT-PS2B):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 3,600 V.
<li>Operating current: 5 to 9 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 15,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 2,800 to 3,600 V at top of ballast resistor.
</ul>

The 1,380 V transformer output feeds a voltage doubler consisting of rectifiers
CR1 and CR2 and filter capacitors C1 through C10 resulting in about 3,600 V
across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than 2 times the peak value of
1,380 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of CR3 to CR9 and C11 through
C17 generates slightly less than 10 times the transformer's peak voltage or
around 18,000 V.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage
Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a description of its design and operation.
<p>
Q1 through Q4, their associated resistors, and U1 (LM723) maintain a constant
voltage of 22 V across the combination of R19 + R20 so the tube current will
be 22/(R16 + R17).  For example, with the R17 set for 750 ohms, the tube
current will be 6.3 mA.  The adjustment range is approximately 5 to 9 mA.
The voltage compliance range of this power supply is about 800 V at 5 mA
(possibly a couple hundred volts greater at higher currents).
<p>
The anode ballast resistor, Rba, needs to be large enough to maintain stability
(at least 75K-47K=38K or so in this case) and should be as close to the HeNe
tube as possible.  Commercial laser heads generally include an internal 75K
ballast resister.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast
Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for more information.
<p>
I use an Aerotech PS2B which has had it regulator bypassed for general testing
of HeNe laser tubes and heads from 0.5 mW to greater than 12 mW output power.
I even installed it in a longer Aerotech case (from an LS4P laser) and
included a small Variac for voltage/current control.

Meter Box</A>.

<h3>Aerotech Model PS2A-X HeNe Laser Power Supply (AT-PS2A-X)</h3>

This is the other version of the Aerotech model PS2.  I have modified it by
replacing the original (fried) high side regulator (identical to the one in
the model PS2B) with a wide compliance low side regulator using PNP
transistors instead of the more conventional NPN type.  The advantage of using
PNPs is that the controls can be near ground potential (rather than floating
at the top of the transistor cascade) and mounted directly to the metal case.
As drawn, the compliance is about 800 V. The poor little panel mount pots
might not be very happy with that sort of voltage on them!
<p>
Estimated specifications (AT-PS2A-X):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 3,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 3 to 9 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 12,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 2,200 to 3,000 V at top of ballast resistor.

Note: The total ballast resistance, Rb, should be 75K or more to maintain
stability.  It is desirable for there to be at laest 20K in the power supply
itself (Rbp) to provide short circuit protection.  The remainder (Rba) should
be as close to the HeNe tube anode as possible.  Commercial laser heads
generally include an internal 75K ballast resister.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for
more information.
<p>
The 1,150 V transformer output feeds a voltage doubler consisting of rectifiers
CR1 and CR2 and filter capacitors C1 to C4 and C6 to C9 resulting in about
3,000 V across all the electrolytics.  (Slightly less than 2 times the peak
value of 1,150 VRMS.)  The voltage multiplier consisting of CR3 to CR9 and C11
through C17 generates up to 10 times the transformer's peak voltage or around
15,000 V (the actual value will depend on various factors including stray
capacitance and other losses).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage Multiplier Starting Circuits</A> for a
description of its design and operation.
<p>
Current adjust (R15) and current range (R13) pots have been added, the latter
being set by a screwdriver.  This allows fairly linear control of tube current
up to the set limit from the front panel.  The minimum current is determined
by what bypasses the transistors and passes through the base resistors.  This
will be up to 3 mA depending on operating conditions.
<p>
As desribed in the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat2">Enhancements to
AT-PS1</A>, a current test point and 'Beam-On' indicator have also been added.
<p>
The NPN transistor (Q1) buffers the reference voltage so that the very low
current source from R15 can drive the base of the pass transistor cascade.
<p>
The base resistors, RX1 through RX3 equally distribute the voltage across the
3 PNP pass transistor, QX1 to QX3.  The respective transistors act as emitter
followers and maintain approximately the same voltages across their C-E
terminals.  Within the compliance range, the voltage across R13+R14 will be
nearly equal to the voltage on the wiper of R15.
<p>
R17 and C18 act as a snubber to protect the transistor cascade from the initial
over voltage when the tube fires but before the regulator can turn on.  I do
not know whether this is needed or how much if any it would protect the pass
transistors when operating near their maximum ratings.
<p>
Three pass transistors are shown here only because that particular number fit
conveniently into the drawing. :-)  A greater or fewer number could be used
with their associated base resistors.  I will probably use 4 to provide a
greater compliance and permit the same supply to drive a wider range of tubes.
If only one particular tube is to be driven, a single stage in conjunction
with a ballast resistor selected to set the operating current at the mid point
of the range may be adequate.

<li>Back to <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe Laser Power Supply Schematics Sub-Table of Contents</A>.
<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 255 Exciter (SP-255)</h3>

The SP-255 is basically similar to several of the other AC line powered HeNe
power supplies in this document.  But, it DOES provide a much higher maximum
current than most - more than 15 mA.  This is definite overkill for the common
HeNe tubes we have been dealing with but may be needed for some other HeNe
lasers.
<p>
The SP-255 exciter was designed to drive medium-to-large frame HeNe lasers
like the Spectra-Physics model SP-124B.  Although only rated at 15 mW, the
SP-124B may produce more than 36 mW when new. :-)  (See the
sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp12x">Spectra-Physics 124
and 125 HeNe Laser Specifications</A>.)
<p>
The SP-255 can easily be adapted for use with other lasers of similar size.
Except for the whimpy starter (see below), it would easily
drive HeNe tubes with power outputs of up to 35 mW (which with their longer
bores, may need more starting voltage than the SP-124B).  These
include the Spectra-Physics 127 (and the similar OEM 107 and 907)
Siemens LGK7676 (and its varients).  Also see the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henish">Interesting and Strange HeNe Lasers</A> for
other examples of HeNe tubes that may be compatible with this power supply
<p>
For this model, I have both an original schematic and an actual sample unit.
My only complaint is that the laser head (LT1 and Rb) attaches via a high
quality HV BNC connector rather than the more common Alden type.  Well,
I guess you can't have everything!
<p>
Estimated specifications (SP-255):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 6,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 6.5 to 15 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 12,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 3,500 to 6,000 V at top of ballast resistor.
</ul>
<p>
Note: I suspect that the actual specs on compliance range are considerably
lower, perhaps only 1,000 V (e.g., 4,500 to 5,500 V) but the value above might
be possible at lower tube currents (less ripple).
<p>
This power supply will easily drive common HeNe tubes up to about 20 mW at the
low end of its current range.  The only thing possibly preventing it from
powering larger 25 to 35 mW HeNe tubes is its somewhat anemic starting voltage
(considering its exceptional 6,000 V maximum operating voltage and much more
than adequate maximum current).  The starting voltage is also not fully
rectified so it pulses at 60 Hz and any capacitance in the cable and tube
will greatly reduce its peak value.  For high power or hard-to-start HeNe
tubes, a small external boost starter may be needed.  Alternatively, if
you are willing to modify the power supply itself, additional stages can
easily be added to the internal voltage multiplier if starting turns out
to be a problem with your HeNe tube(s).  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp31">Enhancements to Spectra-Physics Model 255
Exciter</A>.
<p>
The schematic is available in ASCII (below) as well as in PDF
format (link further below).  For the ASCII version and the accompanying
description, I have changed the part numbers to be more logically organized
on the diagram.
<p>
Thus, if you are attempting to repair one of these supplies, they will not
match the Spectra-Physics schematic (but there were no circuit board markings
on mine anyhow).  Also, the schematic and actual hardware differed in some
component values but not anything that appears to be critical except that
if your unit only has one capacitor for C3/C4, check its voltage rating - the
use of two caps may have been an 'improvement'. :)  Resistor values may also
differ in various revisions.  For example, another version used 56K, 3W
for R10-R15 instead of the 30K, 5W resistors shown below.

Primary-side components consist of a fuse, power switch, neon power-on
indicator, line voltage select switch, and interlock jack (for Jones plug
jumper, some versions).
<p>
Here are the winding specs for the power transformer, T1 (from someone who had
to disassemble one because they pushed their luck too far):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Primary: 189 turns (100 VAC tap), then 32 turns (117 VAC tap), then 15
 turns (125 VAC tap), #28 AWG.  There are actually a pair of these windings
 to handle 115/230 VAC power.
<p>
<li>Secondary: 4140 turns in 23 layers of 180 turns each, #38 AWG (possibly
 with thicker insulation than standard).
</ul>
<p>
The basic circuit consisting of T1, CR1-CR4, and C1-C2, is a standard voltage
doubler.  R1-R8 provide a bleeder resistance as well as biasing the series
regulator voltage reference.  A single stage boost multiplier consisting of
CR5-CR6 and C3-C4, provides a peak starting voltage approximately twice the
no-load operating voltage - nearly 4 * V(peak) or 4 * 1.414 * VRMS of T1.
<p>
The series regulator is in the low side of the power supply and consists of
a cascade of MJE3439 NPN transistors - a total of 7 in all (Q1-Q7).  The
combination of the MJE3439s and their associated base resistors labeled as
Qx (Q2-Q6) and Rx (R11-R15) (the network denoted by the 'x's) are repeated 5
times (total) stacked one on top of the other to complete the diagram - I was
lazy!).
<p>
Operating current is set by the Current Adjust pot (R20) and will be equal to:
Io = 5.3 V / (R19 + R20) within the voltage compliance range of the regulator.
The current range is about 6.5 to 15 mA.  This could easily be extended to a
lower current by increasing the R19 or R20 though it would seem like a waste
of a nice piece of hardware to power a 0.5 mW HeNe tube!  However, it could be
used for this purpose if run from a Variac though the starting voltage would
be proportionally lower and possibly inadequate unless the Variac were turned
up until the tube started (but with way excessive current) and then quickly
reduced - hard on both the tube and exciter though.
<p>
With 7 MJE3439s, the compliance range may be greater than 2,500 V.  (However,
usable compliance range is reduced at higher tube currents due to ripple.)
ZD2 provides protection to limit the voltage across the regulator to a safe
value for the transistors (approximately 2,600 V total, 370 V across each)
should the compliance range be exceeded due to an accidental short circuit,
defective laser head, or a HeNe tube which is too small.  However, this allows
more current to flow into the load which may then not be very happy :-(.

There are taps on the two primaries of T1 for 100, 117, and 125 VAC (primaries
in parallel), and 200, 234, and 250 VAC (primaries in series).  These would
also provide additional options for the output voltage range when used without
a Variac.  The actual power supply has an externally accessible switch to
select 115 or 230 VAC operation.  However, changing the taps requires going
inside and doing some minor soldering.

These schematics were drawn using the original Spectra-Physics part numbers
for at least one version.  It has obviously undergone some revisions as a
couple of the part values are not sequential.
<p>
Newer versions of the SP-255 also have a two pin socket for a primary-side
interlock, a circuit to implement the CDRH delay (4 seconds minimum, not shown
on the schematics, but appears to be a thermal delay and power relay), a
keyswitch for power, an incandescent power indicator (replaceable) instead
of a neon lamp, and a detachable power cord with standard IEC connector.
Note that the delay time of the time delay circuit will increase as the
line voltage is reduced and the power supply will not come on at all below
some point.  If anyone has the schematic of the time delay circuit, please

As noted above, the starting voltage provided by this power supply (about
twice the maximum operating voltage) may not be sufficient for modern large
or hared-to-start tubes, especially if it is run on a Variac at reduced line
voltage.  Adding additional stages to the existing voltage multiplier is the
most straightforward solution if you are willing to modify the internal
circuitry.
<p>
When run at full line voltage, one additional multiplier stage will result in a
starting voltage that approaches 18 kV.  This should be sufficient for most
HeNe tubes.  However, more stages may be needed if the supply is to be run at
reduced line voltage.  See the other HeNe laser power supply schematics for
ideas.
<p>
My only concern would be the insulating rating of the HV connector - I do not
know if it is sufficient for this boosted starting voltage.  An Alden type
connector might in fact be better.
<p>
Here is the relevant portion of the schematic modified to show one additional
multiplier stage (more stages can be easily added):

Where it's desired not to modify the SP-255 internally, one of the following
passive boost circuits can be added without going inside.  With its additional
diode and capacitor to filter the output (D3 and C3), this will actually
provide better performance than the circuit above (these, of course, could
be added to the internal booster as well):

<p>
These smaller cap uF values appear to work fine.  Note that an external
boost stage like this can only be used on a power supply where the final
multiplier output is unfiltered (it comes from a HV diode in parallel
with the driving cap) so it has an (unfiltered) AC component.  This is also
the case with the SP-256, which is really just a baby version of the
SP-255 with a similarly whimpy starter. :)  However, most other HeNe laser
power supplies, including those from Spectra-Physics, have an adequate
starter, though additional boost may be desirable for hard-to-start tubes.
<p>
This addition permitted my unmodified SP-255 to easily start and run the
SP-107/907 and Siemens LGK-7676S large-frame (25 to 35 mW) HeNe laser heads.
With the original SP-255, starting was very problematic and required the
fast dV/dt where the power supply capacitors were fully discharged (I added
a 200M HV resistor across the output to quickly discharge them).  However,
even this usually required the SP-255 to be on a Variac set for 140 VAC and
still wasn't 100% reliable.  With the boost circuit, starting occurs
consistently at around the same input voltage as required for stable operation
(115 to 125 VAC) and the SP-255 appears quite happy running these lasers which
are considerably larger than the 15 mW SP-124 for which it was designed.
(The SP-207 is the power supply usually used for the SP-107/907 and similar
high power tubes.  I did have to reduce the ballast resistance on the
LGK-7676S to 60K from 108K or else it would cut off after a couple minutes.
There was no problem with the SP-907.)
Using one of the lower line voltage taps on the SP-255's power transformer
would probably help in a marginal case (low line voltage, or a laser with
a higher HeNe tube voltage or higher ballast resistance) where regulation
can't be maintained with adequate current without using a Variac to boost
line voltage.  For one
SP-255 which I didn't want to modify, I mounted the components on a piece
of perf. board inside a plastic pill bottle.  The input comes from the
HV BNC of the SP-255;
the output is an Alden female connector.  For another SP-255 that had already
had its HV BNC connector butchered, I installed the added components in a
pill bottle inside with an Alden connector hanging out the back as there's no
place to mount the Alden internally.
<p>
Without C3 and D3, part of the boost voltage is in the form of unrectified
line frequency pulses - which may be attenuated quite a bit due to the
capacitance of a long cable.  The booster still works without the additional
diode and capacitor but won't be quite as effective at generating enough
voltage for a particularly hard-to-start (or hard-to-restart) tube and the
AC component of the multiplier may tend to cause the tube to drop out at a
slightly lower line voltage than possible with well filtered DC.
<p>
I would also recommend adding a 'Beam-On' indicator and current meter or test
points (in the HeNe tube cathode circuit) and a voltage meter or test points
(between Y and HV-).  (This can be done to either circuit.)  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat2">Enhancements to AT-PS1</A> for some suggestions
and details.  After all, the SP-255 is suitable for some nice high power HeNe
tubes and you don't want to take chances.  Mounting a control on the front
panel to replace the PCB-mounted current adjust pot would also be nice.  At
reduced line voltage, the enhanced SP-255 will also run medium size HeNe
lasers so using a slightly higher value pot to allow the bottom end of the
current range to go down to 6 mA would be useful.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 256 Exciter (SP-256)</h3>

Despite its higher model number, the SP-256 is a lower power version of the
SP-255 and was designed for use with the smaller SP-120 laser.  See the
sections: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp3">Spectra-Physics Model 255 Exciter
(SP-255)</A> and <A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp12x">Spectra-Physics 120, 124, and
125, HeNe Laser Specifications</A>.  The circuitry is generally similar but
with lower voltage components and fewer pass transistors and it's in the same
size case.
<p>
(The complete user manual for the SP-120 laser with SP-256 exciter can be
found at <A HREF="http://lasers.757.org/manuals/">Lasers.757.org, Manuals</A>
but this page may be dead.)
<p>
Estimated specifications (SP-256):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 4,500 V.
<li>Operating current: 4.5 to 7.8 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 8,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 3,500 to 4,000 V at top of ballast resistor.
</ul>
<p>
The compliance range of 500 V is the one actually specified in the manual
(though it doesn't actually list the lower and upper voltages).  I expect
that at reduced current settings where power supply ripple is lower, the
voltage compliance could easily go much higher, perhaps more than twice this
value since the regulator has a maximum (protected) limit of about 1,500 V.

</PRE>
<p>
The basic circuit consisting of T101, CR105-CR106, and C105-C106, is a
standard voltage doubler.  R101-R103 provide a bleeder resistance as well as
biasing the series regulator voltage reference.  A single stage boost
multiplier consisting of CR104 and C102, provides a peak starting voltage
approximately twice the no-load operating voltage - nearly 4 * V(peak) or
4 * 1.414 * VRMS of T101.
<p>
The series regulator is in the low side of the power supply and consists of
a cascade of MJE3439 NPN transistors - a total of 5 in all (Q105-Q109).  The
combination of the MJE3439s and their associated base resistors labeled as
Qx (Q101-Q103) and Rx (R106-R108) (the network denoted by the 'x's) are
repeated 3 times (total) stacked one on top of the other to complete the
diagram - I was lazy!).
<p>
Operating current is set by the Current Adjust pot (R113) and will be equal to:
Io = 5.3 V / (R112 + R113) within the voltage compliance range of the
regulator.  The current range is about 4.5 to 7.8 mA.  The sample I have
will only go to a maximum current of about 7.25 mA though which suggests
that the reference zener (CR113) may actually be 5.6 V instead of 6 V.  Next
time I have the SP-256 open, I'll check. :)
<p>
With 5 MJE3439s, the theoretical compliance range is greater than 1,500 V
though the specs say only 500 V - indicating margin for power supply ripple.
CR112 provides protection to limit the voltage across the regulator to a safe
value for the transistors (approximately 1,500 V total, 300 V across each)
should the compliance range be exceeded due to an accidental short circuit,
defective laser head, or a HeNe tube which is too small.  However, this allows
more current to flow into the load which may then not be very happy :-(.
<p>
Like the SP-255, there are taps on the two primaries of T101 for 100, 117, and
125 VAC (primaries in parallel), and 200, 234, and 250 VAC (primaries in
series).
<p>
With modifications similar to those for the SP-255, the SP-256 can be used
to reliably start and run 20+ mW laser heads like the Uniphase 1145/P.  The
specific changes I made were to use the 100 VAC transformer taps, add the
starter booster, and reduce the high power 100K ohm series resistor (between
Q101 collector and ground) to 25K, 5 W.  None of these changes may be needed
if run at 125 to 135 VAC on a Variac.  With the tap and resistor change,
it starts healthy 1145Ps reliably at normal line voltage (110 to 125 VAC)
the first time, but may not restart them without allowing time for the
tube and power supply capacitance to discharge.  Apparently, the high
dV/dt is needed with the whimpy starter of the SP-256.  This does mean
that if the line voltage dips and the tube cuts out, it may not immediately
restart.  With high mileage or hard-start tubes, the extra kick may be needed
to start initially.
<p>
An easy way to adjust the line voltage without changing taps (or slightly
beyond the tap range) is to add a small power transformer externally with
its secondary in series with the input to the supply.  For example, to
effectively boost a 105 V line to 117 V, use a 12 V transformer.  Just
make sure to get the phase correct or else it will reduce the voltage!
(Note that if your line voltage really is under 110 V, it's below spec
and putting stress on motor-driven appliances like air conditioners, as
well as on electronics using switchmode power supplies.  So, that should
be corrected if possible.  Check with your power company as others are
likely affected.)
<p>
CAUTION: Failure of the series regulator could
result in 15 mA or more through the tube, which won't last long at that
current.  Properly sizing the AC line fuse is probably adequate protection
as the difference in input current is around 0.5 A under regulator short
circuit conditions.  The 0.5 A, time delay fuse I found in this particular
unit would probably blow after a few seconds.  However, to be doubly sure,
it is a relatively simple matter to add an overcurrent crowbar circuit
that would turn the supply off if it exceeded the selected current by
more than 0.5 mA.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 207 Exciter (SP-207)</h3>

The SP-207 is apparently intended for use with the SP-107 or SP-907 which are
similar to the SP-127 but configured in an open resonator for OEM applications.
It is sort of a stretch version of the very popular SP-124B.  The overall
design of the SP-207 exciter is very similar to that of the SP-255 (above)
but has a higher operating voltage and a greater compliance range.
<p>
Like the SP-255, the SP-207 is an AC line powered supply using a linear
regulator and voltage multiplier starter.  The major obvious difference
between them is that the SP-207 uses 11 transistors in the linear regulator
compared to 7 of them for the SP-255.
<p>

Estimated specifications (SP-207):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 6,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 7.5 to 17.5 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 18,000 V (12 KVDC + 6 KV pulse).
<li>Compliance range: 3,000 to 6,000 V at top of ballast resistor.
</ul>

The design is mostly similar to other line powered HeNe laser power supplies
with the normal doubler and a 3 stage voltage multiplier.  Although I don't
have specifications for the high voltage transformer (T101), based on the
DC output, I would expect its secondary to be around 2.5 kVAC at 50 mA.
The regulator uses a Darlington pair for the bottom transistor and ten
MJE3439s for the others.  Using the 8.2 V zener (D108) as the voltage
reference, the tube current will be approximately: (8.2 - 1.4)/(390 + R118)
or about 7.5 to 17.5 mA.  The recommended operating current for the plasma
tube used in the SP-107/127 is 11.5 mA (+/- 0.5 mA) at an operating voltage of
5 kV (+/- 0.4 kV).  I assume this includes the voltage across the ballast
resistance which is inside the tube in large-frame Spectra-Physics lasers.
<p>
Part of the starter is, well, strange.  It would appear that SG1 is expected
to arc over if the voltage goes high enough without the tube starting.  Then
that pulse will pass through C101 and boost the anode voltage still further.
This may have been a kludge - err - feature, added in response to the poor
starting performance of the SP-255.
<p>
One interesting twist is the use of the bypass diode, D104, which appears to
protect the regulator from excessive voltage during a short circuit - it
passes current around the regulator when the voltage across the regulator
exceeds about half the output voltage of the rectifier/filter.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 261A Exciter (SP-261A)</h3>

This is to the best of my knowledge, SP's largest HeNe laser power supply,  It
is designed to drive the SP-125A laser spec'd at a nominal 50 to 70 mW but
may be capable of as much as 150 to 200 mW when new.  The laser head itself is
about 6 feet long, weighs over 100 pounds, and definitely looks like something
out of a SciFi movie.  The HeNe tube operates at around 6 kV with a dual
discharge, each at 15 to 25 mA.  See the sections starting with
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp12x">Spectra-Physics 124 and 125 HeNe Laser
Specifications</A> for more info on these large HeNe lasers.
<p>
(Note that the SP-250 is the optional RF exciter for the SP-125 replacing
the SP-261A.  The SP-250 includes an SP-200 inside a larger box with what
looks like another similar RF section.)

I have entered schematics for the SP-261A power circuits and SP-125A laser
head.  If there is enough popular demand, I will also draw the RF driver
circuit.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematics for the SP-261A and SP-125A in PDF format:
 <a href="261apsch.pdf">SP-261A-PWR/125A-HEAD</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The SP-261A consists of the operating voltage supply, transformer based
regulator, and RF (stabilization) driver.  The pulse starter is in the SP-125A
laser head itself so there is none in the power supply.  Here is a brief
description of each subsystem:
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage - This is an AC line powered unit with a traditional
 high voltage transformer and voltage doubler.  Two pairs of 6 kV diodes
 feed fourteen 75 uF, 450 V electrolytic capacitors each with a 220K, 2 W
 equalizing resistor.  Interestingly, the output is negative with the positive
 grounded to the chassis through the current sense components and current
 panel meter.  The transformer can be switched to operate on either 115 VAC or
 230 VAC.
<p>
<li>Transformer based regulator - One winding of a second transformer is wired
 in series with the main transformer's HV output to the doubler.  The other
 winding of this transformer feeds an SCR based electronically variable load.
 The tube current is sensed by a series resistor in positive return and via a
 unijunction transistor trigger, controls the firing angle of a pair of SCRs.
<p>
 The sensed current produces a voltage across R122, R123, and R124, which
 determines how fast the unijunction transistor (Q101) will trigger on each
 half cycle of the AC input.  This in turn triggers one of two SCRs to turn on
 at a varying point in the cycle.  When on, the SCR essentially shorts out the
 primary of the regulator transformer (T102) which throttles the voltage to
 the main output.  The higher the current, the earlier the SCR turns on, and
 the higher the effective load.
<p>
 It appears to be kind of a miracle this works at all (and apparently some of
 these units DO have stability problems or worse) but it's actually kind of
 clever.  This approach probably results in somewhat lower power dissipation
 and superior efficiency compared to a linear cascade regulator, especially
 for this higher current power supply.
<p>
 Some versions of the SP-261A replace the pair of SCRs (SCR101,SCR102) with a
 single triac.  This also eliminates the bridge rectifier (CR105-CR108) and the
 second set of trigger components (CR109,R119,C117,R118).  However, operation
 of this simplified circuit is basically similar.
<p>
<li>RF driver (not drawn) - A separate 28 VDC power supply protected against
 overcurrent faults) feeds a crystal oscillator and two stage tuned RF amp to
 provide a stabilization RF source for the laser.  A matching network in the
 laser head couples the RF source to an electrode in close proximity to the
 HeNe tube bore.  The use of this RF isn't essential but apparently helps to
 reduce  optical noise in the laser beam - while interfering with every radio
 in the vicinity. :)  (This RF driver is NOT the same as the RF power supply
 option for the SP-125A laser - that replaces both the SP-261A and starter in
 the laser head.)

<h3>HeNe Laser Power Supply from LaserDisc Player 1 (LP-HL1)</h3>

The schematic shown in <A HREF="lphl1sch.gif">HeNe Laser Power Supply from
LaserDisc Player 1 (LP-HL1)</A> was reverse engineered by Tom
(<A HREF="mailto:tboehm@kscable.com">tboehm@kscable.com</A>).
The exact model of the player is not known for sure but
it may be the Pioneer LD-660, one of the "second generation" HeNe laser-based
LaserDisc player from the early 1980s.
<p>
For more on Pioneer LaserDisc players, see the document:
"Notes on the Troubleshooting and Repair of
Optical Disc Players and Optical Data Storage Drives".
<p>
The circuitry at the lower is the usual voltage doubler and filter capacitor
bank (fed from a winding on the main transformer, T1) with a linear constant
regulator (Q10). Interestingly, these are both in the cathode circuit with
the ballast resistor (Rb) and trigger attached to the anode.  The input "I"
must be grounded to turn on the laser.
<p>
Note that this schematic combines the circuitry of the HeNe laser power supply
PCB, power transformer, and relevant parts of the required low voltage DC
power supplies, located elsewhere.  The wire just to the right of C16 is
the connection from the separate low voltage DC power supply (brown wire
for plus and black wire for ground) and "I" is a red wire.
<p>
The circuitry in the upper right section of the schematic provides drive to
the trigger transformer for starting the HeNe tube.  Once the tube starts,
this is disabled by Q3 via the sense resistor R20 and Q9.
<p>
At the very least, this entire affair appears to be way overly complex. :)
<p>
Here are some additional comments from Tom:
<p>
When this circuit was in the original player, everything was mounted to the
chassis. No shielding was present anywhere.  Capacitors C19, C20, and the
asterisked coil form a line-filter/surge suppressor. They were mounted on
their own little board in the player, so I left them on the board. T1, the
main power transformer, has one primary wound for 120 VAC and three secondary
windings. One for high voltage and two for lower voltages, one of those is
center-tapped. The high voltage winding pegged my meter on the 1,000 V
range. I was extremely brief when I checked it. I didn't want an expensive
continuity checker or worse. The center winding was about 40 VAC and the top
winding was about 25 VAC. It was center-tapped, so I used only half of it. By
doing this, I could get a voltage level down closer to the level I needed for
the low-end circuits. The rectifier circuit (BR1) I built using diodes from
the original power supply. The regulator is an LM317 variable regulator set
at 9 VDC. I used an adjustable regulator because I didn't know what voltage
level I needed when I first tried to fire this up. From the voltage rating
marked on C12, I knew it couldn't be much.
<p>
Now, onto the good stuff. Q1 is an input amp. It has to be grounded to
circuit ground or have a signal applied to it. Before I found out it could
be grounded, I was using a 20 Hz signal from a pattern generator to run the
tube. Q2 and Q4 and surrounding components (I do believe) is some sort of
oscillator or multi-vibrator circuit. While trying to check voltages, I
probed the collector of Q4 and the circuit started to whine and the tube
began to sputter, so I backed off. My meter was loading down an oscillator
and causing the circuit to operate funny. I thought it was best to wait until
I had an oscilloscope before I started to check voltages again. The circuits
in this collection that I am unfamiliar with are around and with Q6 and Q7,
and those around Q3, Q8, and Q9.
<p>
Everything else is familiar though. What is marked T2 is some kind of
starting transformer used in initiating a high voltage starting pulse to
the tube. Some of these unfamiliar circuits could be used during initial
start-up, then stop after the tube is running. It could be receiving a
pulse, I've heard of tubes having to use a high voltage starting pulse to
start and keep running with a timed pulse. I still have to experiment
more. In the multiplier section, there is a safety feature which I bypassed,
but on further speculation, I better restore it. It's marked "SSI" under
R34. It was originally a safety interlock switch. If someone was to open the
player during operation to change a disc, it would effectively shut down the
beam and protect the operator from exposure. It also had a second purpose, it
shut down the multiplier so no high voltage was generated. Though the
oscillator circuitry could be left running allowing for an easy start. I
consider this switch served a dual purpose.
<p>
Everything happens extremely fast in this circuit.  Upon start-up, the high
voltage tap on the main transformer instantly charges the multiplier circuit
and at the same time, the low voltage tap starts the oscillator circuit
(Q2-Q4) into oscillation. After oscillation starts, a sample pulse is sent
to Q10, and at the same time, the pulse is amplified by Q5 to cause Q6 and
Q7 (a Darlington configuration) to trigger the tube via the trigger
transformer. Once the tube starts, Q3 shuts down the oscillator, the tube
is sustained through the high voltage tap of the transformer.

<h3>HeNe Laser Power Supply from LaserDisc Player 2 (LP-HL2)</h3>

This is the HeNe laser power supply from the Pioneer VP-1000 LaserDisc
player - one of the first, if not *the* first consumer LaserDisc player,
introduced around 1980.  I may have been used in some later models as
well.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for LP-HL2 in PDF format:
 <a href="lphl2sch.pdf">LP-HL2-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The part numbers used were mostly those listed in the VP-1000 service manual.
The output of the HV transformer was measured at around 900 VRMS and the DC
voltage across the filter capacitor bank was about 2,250 VDC.  The voltage
from the top of the external ballast resistor to the tube cathode was about
1,600 VDC.  This supply requires a separate -15 VDC power supply to bias the
zener reference for the tube current, set at 5 mA.  Without this bias, the
laser tube just flashes, not good for the tube and probably not good for the
transistors either.  It would be straightforward to convert the design
to self bias the zener as with many of the other schematics in this chapter.
Alternatively, a variable DC power supply or fixed supply with a pot could
be substituted for the zener to enable the current to be adjusted.  Or, R2
could be changed to a rheostat for adjustable current.

<h3>Coherent Model 80 HeNe Laser Power Supply (CO-80)</h3>

The Coherent Model 80 is an AC line powered unit with the usual stack
of ten 10 uF, 450 V electrolytic capacitors driven from a transformer
and doubler.  Its output goes to a potted module that contain the
starter and linear regulator.  The one I have is set at 5 mA and
seems to be fixed (no obvious pot).  It would probably be most happy
with a laser head requiring about 2,500 V.  With a typical 5 mW head,
it goes overcurrent at an input above about 110 VAC.  It's possible
that one or more of the potted regulator transistors are shorted, so
it may be intended for a lower voltage laser head since there aren't
that many requiring only 5 mA when you get above 2,000 V.  It has likely
been abused and the fuse was missing.  Thus, it being slightly broken
is quite likely.
<p>
This thing also has a separate interlock module attached by a really
short cord which contains a keylock switch, remote plug, and two (2)
indicator lamps of different sizes.  Strange.

<h3>Halted Specialties HeNe Laser Power Supply 1 (HS-PS1)</h3>

The HS-PS1 (my designation) was a power supply kit sold starting in the
late 1980s (at least the PCB has a 1988 date code!).  It uses a HV power
transformer with a basic voltage doubler/filter and voltage multiplier
for starting.  The filter bank consists of ten, 10 uF, 450 V electrolytic
capacitors with 500K ohm bleeder resistors while the voltage multiplier
has 9 stages each consisting of a 1N4007 rectifier and 1.6 nF, 3 kV
capacitor.  One is supposed to select the number of value of ballast
resistors to adjust tube current.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 200 Exciter (SP-200)</h3>

The SP-200 won't really power any modern HeNe lasers but I figured this was
the best place to put it. :)
<p>
There were at least two versions of the SP-200.  The desciption below is for
the newer version in the wide short case with leather carrying handle on the
side.
<p>
This is the radio frequency (RF) power source for the quite old
Spectra-Physics model 115 HeNe laser and possibly others.  (There is a photo
of an SP-115 laser head in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment
Gallery</A> under "Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".  It may also be the
RF option for the SP-125 laser.  (See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp12x">Spectra-Physics 120, 124, and
125, HeNe Laser Specifications</A>.  It is no doubt of mid to late 1960s
vintage and of course, uses vacuum tubes for everything.  The oscillator
frequency is set by a 40.68 Mhz crystal which is in a socket, so maybe a
slightly different frequency could be used if desired.  The final stage is a 
little forced air-cooled ceramic tube (4X150A) - really cute. :)  The SP-200
has all the usual transmitter adjustments - oscillator, final grid, and final
plate tuning, grid drive, neutralizing cap, output loading, etc.  I couldn't
resist a quick drawing in <A HREF="sp200fs.gif">Spectra-Physics Model 200
Exciter Final Stage</A> to bring back fond memories of those tube transmitter
days. :-)
<p>
A panel meter monitors final tube current.  The output is via a BNC connector
(which I assume it to be 50 ohms).  A power rheostat adjusts output power
by varying the plate voltage between 275 and 600 VDC.  Maximum input power
appears to be about 120 W (600 V at 200 mA) but that's probably beyond the
'red' line.  There is a hand-drawn mark at 100 mA on the meter face which I
assume to be the recommended operating point.  I attached it to a dummy load
(a household incandescent lamp) and estimate the usable RF power to be in the
20 to 50 Watt range.  This is consistent with my "how bright a fluorescent
lamp glows test".  (I do have a manual that mentions the older SP-200 with
a power output spec of 52 W.)
<p>
A front panel BNC is provided for modulation input.  Driven from a function
generator, it would quite nicely strobe that fluorescent lamp and at audio
frequencies, be picked up on a nearby stereo receiver as a faint tone.  There
is also a "start" button on the front panel and non-BNC connector associated
with it on the rear panel.  This connects to a pulse transformer in the SP-112
(and perhaps other) laser head which is used to initiate the discharge.  Yes,
even though the laser is RF excited, starting is necessary.
<p>
I wouldn't be surprised if the designer of this unit took the circuit out of
the ARRL (American Radio Relay League) handbook - the amateur ("ham") radio
enthusiast's bible - which is what I would have done back in 1965 or so (and
which I did for some high power RF projects around 1969!).  I don't yet have a
schematic for this beast and will probably not attempt to reverse engineer it.
However, if someone has any documentation on the SP-200 or its
associated laser, please send me mail via the

<h2>Sam's Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supplies</h2>

The next 3 designs span the range from low to high power - Unless you have
a laser 2 meters long, one of these will be able to power your HeNe tube!
SG-HL1 and SG-HL2 have been tested with a variety of tubes.  SG-HL3 has not
been constructed as yet but may be in the future - I still need a reliable
way to drive 35 mW HeNe tubes.
<p>
It should be quite straightforward to modify these designs for higher or lower
power and adding regulators, modulators, and other bells and whistles.

<h3>Sam's Small Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL1)</h3>

This one is quite similar to the two Aerotech models PS1 and PS2 and is
suitable for HeNe tubes rated up to about 5 mW.  It can be constructed
entirely with parts that are readily available and relatively inexpensive.
Well, that is, except for the power transformer which you will still have
to scrounge from somewhere.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdacl3">AC Line Operated Power Supplies</A> for
possible sources for these boat anchors.  Also, due to low demand, the prices
of high voltage electrolytic capacitors seem to be quite high (about $1.00
each for 10 uF at 450 V).  I had a pair of surplus 1 uF, 1,500 V oil filled
capacitors so I used them instead.  A pair of microwave oven HV capacitors
could also be used since these are typically around 1 uF at a minimum of 2,000
VAC (greater than 3,000 VDC).  The cost of the remaining components (diodes,
capacitors, and resistors) was less than $5.
<ul>
<li>The high voltage rectifiers for the doubler are each constructed from five
  1N4007s in series.
<p>
<li>The main filter on the doubler is a pair of 1 uF, 1,500 V oil filled
  capacitors with 10M bleeder resistors on each.
<p>
<li>The high voltage rectifiers for the multiplier are each constructed from four
  1N4007s in series.
<p>
  The high voltage capacitors for the multiplier are each constructed from four
  .001 uF, 1,000 V ceramic disk capacitors in series.
<p>
  The series resistor for the parasitic multiplier is 10 M.
<p>
<li>There is currently no regulator - I may add that at a later time.  For now,
  a Variac is used to adjust beam current.
</ul>
I have left room for equalizing components on the diode and capacitor stacks
but so far am running without them without any problems up to 2,500 VDC for
the operating voltage.
<p>
It took me roughly 3 hours to construct the doubler and starting multiplier on
an old blank digital (DIP) prototyping board.
<p>
I then tested it with a Variac and a current meter with several tubes from
1 mW to 5 mW:
<ul>
<li>1 mW Spectra-Physics (3.2 mA): 1,400 V with Rb=100K.
<p>
<li>1 mW Aerotech (4 mA): 1,900 V with Rb=100K, 1,700 with Rb=22K (additional
  ballast resistor in laser head).
<p>
<li>5 mW Aerotech (6 mA): 2,300 V with Rb=22K (additional ballast resistor in
  laser head.
</ul>
The Variac was quite effective at adjusting tube current.
<p>
At 115 VAC the output of the power supply is about 2,500 VDC.  This design
appears to behave in all respects similarly to the commercial power supplies.
<p>
Estimated specifications (SG-HL1):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,500 to 2,500 V.
<li>Operating current: 0 to 10 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 7,500 to 12,500 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulator as yet.
</ul>

<h3>Sam's Mid-Size Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL2)</h3>

This one uses an oil burner ignition transformer and will drive tubes rated
between about 5 and 20 mW of beam power.  I have not added a regulator to it
since due to the severe voltage droop of the transformer, a compliance range
of several kV would be needed - this is not really practical, at least not
easily.  I just run the supply on a Variac while monitoring HeNe tube current.
<p>
An oil burner ignition transformer rated at 10 kVAC and 23 mA drives a full
wave rectifier using microwave oven HV diodes.  The DC filter consists of 4
oil filled .25 uF, 3,500 WVDC capacitors.  A 100K resistor (between the two
pairs of caps in a pi configuration) was added to reduce ripple and improve
stability at low tube currents.
<p>
The centertap of the transformer's HV winding is connected to its metal case
internally and to earth ground for safety (via a 3 prong wall plug).  Since
the negative of the supply is therefore grounded, the HeNe tube cathode will
end up being a few volts above ground if the normal current sense resistor and
'Beam On' LED are included.  This is usually acceptable unless the cathode of
the HeNe tube is connected to the metal case of a laser head and cannot be
removed - the laser head should be grounded for safety unless it can be
totally insulated from human contact.  Floating the transformer is probably
not a great idea since an internal fault (short) could result in line voltage
on its case - and this could find its way into the power supply wiring.
<p>
Starting voltage is provided by a small high frequency inverter.  In fact,
originally, I was using the same inverter that is the main power source in:
"Sam's inverter driven HeNe laser power supply 2 (SG-HI2)".  In this case it
was just used for starting!  At present, I am using the HV module from a long
ago retired Monitronix workstation monitor.  It is rated at 25 kV but more than
30 kV is actually available if needed as a result of some careful tweaking.
Thus, starting any HeNe tube is simply not a problem. :-)
<p>
Originally, I was using a 15 kV, .5 A microwave oven HV rectifier as the
blocking diode.  After I smoked that with some overzealous application of
excessive starting voltage, I replaced it with a stack of 20 1N4007 general
purpose 1 kV, 1 A diodes soldered together enclosed in a thick plastic tube
for insulation.  I will have to add some more 1N4007s if I decide to really
crank up the starter. ;-)
<p>
The inverter output is introduced across a high voltage blocking diode to
bypass current around the inverter once the tube starts.  Voltage builds up on
the stray capacitance of the HV diodes, wiring, and HeNe tube until the tube
fires.  A pair of 10M ohm series resistors rated for 15 kV isolates the
starter (for safety) and eliminates the annoying tendency for the inverter
pulses to shut the tube *off* after it has started due to capacitive coupling
bypassing the HV rectifier - it only takes a few volts to kill the discharge.
<p>
Note that the inverter HV return must be isolated from ground since it is
attached to the main power supply output to gain the added benefit that the
operating voltage provides in starting.  Take care if this is attached to the
flyback core!
<p>
Starting is not automatic though this feature could be added.  I just power
the inverter until the tube fires - typically less than a second.  To automate
this, just add a transistor to disable the inverter which is switched on by
sensing current flow through the HeNe tube.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns10">Inverter Based
Starters</A> for more info.

Estimated specifications (SG-HL2):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 2,000 to 4,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 to 8 mA.

 Supply (SG-HL2)</A></h4>

<ol>
<li>T1 is rated 10,000 VAC, 23 mA, current limited.  This is typical of the
   type of transformer found on a residential oil burner.
<p>
<li>CR1 and CR2 are standard replacement microwave oven rectifiers rated at
   15 kV PRV, .5 A (gross overkill on the current at least!).
<p>
<li>C1 through C4 are .25 uF, 3,500 V oil filled capacitors.  Each capacitor
   is bypassed with a 10M equalizing/bleeder resistor (R1 through R4).
<p>
<li>Construction is point-to-point using wire with 10 kV insulation except for
   the HV+ lead which uses wire rated for 30 kV.  Smooth rounded connections
   and a conformal insulating coating are essential to minimize corona in the
   high voltage and starting circuitry.
<p>
<li>A Variac is used to adjust operating voltage between 0 and approximately
   4,000 VDC (under load - once the tube has started).  HeNe tube current can
   be monitored at the Test jacks.  Sensitivity is 1 V/mA or directly using a
   mA meter.  The 'Beam On' LED provides another confirmation of laser tube
   operation - an additional safety precaution for higher power lasers.
<p>
<li>The starting inverter is active only during starting and is operated by a
   momentary switch.  It is powered from a separate DC supply.
<p>
   If the HV return of the starter can be safely isolated from ground (with
   10 kV insulation), then it can be connected to point 'A'.  Otherwise, use
   point 'B'.  However, the advantage of the operating voltage being added to
   the starting voltage is lost in this configuration.
<p>
<li>CR3 is a stack of 20 1N4007s in series soldered together and enclosed in a
   thick plastic tube for insulation:

</PRE>
   Where the starting voltage will never exceed 15 kV, a microwave oven
   rectifier (like CR1 or CR2) would be adequate.  However, even the 20 kV PRV
   I am using may be insufficient in case the HeNe tube does not start or
   becomes disconnected - especially when driving the larger and/or hard to
   start HeNe tubes for which this power supply was designed.  Despite their
   beefy current ratings, these rectifiers can still be blown by excessive
   voltage - I have done it :-(.
<p>
<li>The total ballast resistance, Rb, should be 75K or more to maintain
   stability.  It is desirable for there to be at laest 20K in the power supply
   itself (Rbp) to provide short circuit protection.  The remainder (Rba)
   should be as close to the HeNe tube anode as possible.  Commercial laser
   heads generally include an internal 75K ballast resister.  See the section:
   <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for
   more information.
<p>
<li>WARNING: Even though the oil burner ignition transformer (T1), is current
   limited, 23 mA is still enough to be lethal and the HV filter capacitors
   can pack quite a punch.  This power supply is very dangerous.  Take extreme
   care not to touch (or even go near) the high voltage terminals when it is
   operating.  Even after powering down AND pulling the plug, treat it with
   this same degree of respect until you have confirmed that ALL of the filter
   capacitors are fully discharged.
<p>
<li>WARNING: the power output of HeNe lasers driven by this circuit is likely
   to be in the Class IIIb safety classification and definitely hazardous to
   vision.  Take appropriate precautions!

<h3>Sam's Ultrabeam(tm) Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL3)</h3>

This one will drive tubes rated between 7 and 35 mW of beam power - possibly
more.  I have not added a regulator to it though this is certainly possible
using something similar to the low side regulator described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdcre2">High Compliance Cascade Regulator</A> (though it may need to be expanded to
provide even wider compliance).  For now, I run the supply it on a Variac
while monitoring HeNe tube current.
<p>
A pair of power transformers (T1 and T2) originally designed for tube-type
audio amplifier applications provides the input voltage - between 600 and
1,200 VRMS using a Variac on T2 only (terminal V).
<p>
A voltage quadrupler boosts this to the required operating voltage.
<p>
I could also have used my boosted TV power transformer (900 VRMS) in place of
T1 and T2.  This would easily provide 4,800 VDC from a 115 VAC input or over
6,000 VDC from the 140 VRMS output of a Variac.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg1">Sam's Small Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply
(SG-HL1)</A> for details and the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdscl4">Boosting the Output of a Transformer with
Multiple Secondary Windings</A> for some approaches to change the voltage
range.
<p>
CAUTION: If the operating voltage is increased much beyond 6,500 VDC, the
voltage ratings of the rectifiers and capacitors will need to be increased
as well.
<p>
An inverter based starter would be appropriate for this power supply.  Power
for this circuit can be provided by rectifying and filtering the voltage from
the filament windings on one of the power transformers (T1).  The starter's
output is introduced via high voltage isolation resistors across a HV blocking
diode (a microwave oven rectifier) to bypass current around the inverter once
the discharge is initiated.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns10">Inverter Based Starters</A> for more info.
<p>
A simple transistor circuit disables the drive to the starting inverter once
the tube fires by sensing tube current and forcing the 555 based controller
to the reset state.
<p>
Estimated specifications (SG-HL3):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 3,200 to 6,400 V.
<li>Operating current: 5 to 10 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 15,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA, no regulator.

<h3><A NAME="hschptf">AC Line Front-End Made From Hi-Pot Tester</A></h3>

Someone gave me a very bedraggled looking instrument intended to check for
high voltage insulation breakdown - a Hi-Pot Tester.  Well, given that I have
little use for such a device <b>and</b> it had such a nice power transformer
(2,400 VRMS at 20 mA or so), I thought to myself: "Now, what could one do with
such a nice power transformer?".  So, I cleaned up the case and with minor
modifications, the former Hi-Pot Tester can now be pressed into service as the
high voltage source for a medium-to-large HeNe laser power supply.
<p>
See the <A HREF="hipot1.gif">HeNe Laser Power Supply Front-End Made From
Hi-Pot Tester</A> for the schematic of the relevant portions of the unit.
I added high voltage porcelain standoffs (with a protective plastic cover)
for connection to the remainder of the power supply (additional filtering
and the starting circuit at the very least).  The Hi-Pot Tester provided the
AC line circuitry, power transformer, voltage and current meter, and some of
the filter capacitance (not enough though for decently low ripple).  I
replaced the original high voltage vacuum tube diode with a 12 kV microwave
oven rectifier.
<p>
In all fairness, the device can still be used for its intended application
using lower current ranges on the panel meter (down to 20 uA).
<p>
WARNING: Due to the original design of the Hi-Pot Tester, it isn't possible
to arrange for the negative of the power supply output to be earth ground
if an additional HV rectifier to form a voltage doubler is added (for driving
high power HeNe tubes).  So, if this is done, the HeNe tube <b>must</b> be well
insulated at both ends from <b>everything</b> - including a metal-cased laser
head!

<h3>Kim's Mid-Size Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply (KC-HL1)</h3>

Remember how I said not to use a neon sign transformer?  Well, this one DOES
but it is a small one so the spirit is more in keeping with an oil burner
ignition type. :-)
<p>
This power supply was constructed by: Kim Clay (bkc@maco.net) and has been
used to drive a 7 mW HeNe tube (so far).  However, it should be capable of
driving medium size tubes requiring up to 4,000 VDC operating voltage at 8 mA
operating current - possibly more - with only minor modifications (among other
things, due to the no-load output of the power transformer, T1, a higher
voltage filter capacitor and/or shunt pre-regulator may be needed to prevent
the smoke from being released).
<p>
The general design is very similar to the one described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg2">Sam's Mid-Size Line Powered HeNe Laser Power
Supply (SG-HL2)</A> which  is based on an oil burner ignition transformer.  It
uses a flyback type starter based on a 556 dual timer based drive circuit
similar to a simplified version of the flyback based high voltage power supply
described in the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg5">Sam's Inverter Driven
HeNe Laser Power Supply 2 (SG-HI2)</A>.

<h4><A NAME="hsckc11">Operating Voltage for Kim's Mid-Size HeNe Laser Power
 Supply</A></h4>

The operating voltage is provided by a 5,000 VRMS, 30 mA neon sign transformer,
home-made high voltage bridge rectifier, and oil-filled HV filter capacitor.
A Variac is used to adjust the output voltage for each HeNe tube/ballast
combination.  There is no current regulator.

<p>
The total ballast resistance, Rb, should be 75K or more to maintain stability.
It is desirable for there to be at laest 20K in the power supply itself (Rbp)
to provide short circuit protection.  The remainder (Rba) should be as close to
the HeNe tube anode as possible.  Commercial laser heads generally include an
internal 75K ballast resister.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf">Ballast Resistors, Function, Selecting</A> for
more information.
<p>
WARNING: This supply can be deadly!  Don't even think about going near any
part of the high voltage circuitry except with the plug pulled from the wall
and only after confirming that the main filter capacitor has discharged
completely.
<p>
As with any transformer designed to directly drive gas discharge tubes, T1
has significant voltage droop.  At a 7 mA HeNe tube current, the no-load and
operating voltage differ substantially - 4.7 kV versus 3.2 kV.  A simple shunt
regulator could be added to eliminate this problem.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdcre3">Simple Shunt Regulator</A>.
<p>
Since T1 is not a center tapped transformer, a bridge is required to provide
full wave rectification.  This was constructed from stacks of 1N4007 diodes
mounted on perfboard, 11 of these for each of CR1 to CR4.  CR5, the HV bypass
diode, was similarly constructed from 20 - 1N4007s.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhvc0">Standard and Custom HV Rectifiers</A> for
possible construction techniques and considerations.
<p>
Both a voltage meter (M1) and current meter (M2) are permanently attached.
The current limiting resistor for M1 also acts as a bleeder resistor for the
main filter capacitor resulting in a time constant of about 10 seconds.  This
5M resistor (R1) consists of 5 - 1M, 2W resistors in series mounted on
perfboard.  R1 is constructed from multiple resistors in series to handle the
high voltage across this component without damage.

<h4><A NAME="hsckc12">Starter for Kim's Mid-size HeNe Laser Power Supply</A></h4>

The starter uses the flyback from a mono computer monitor driven by an NPN
darlington power transistor that used to be a solenoid driver from a dead dot
matrix printer.  It is quite simple and compact and can be put to other uses
(like powering small HeNe tubes by itself).  The complete description of this

<h3>Tony's Large Frame HeNe Laser Power Supply (TF-HL1)</h3>

(From: Tony Brock-Fisher.)
<p>
This is a home-built power supply capable of driving HeNe lasers like the
Spectra-Physics-127/107/907 and Siemens/LASOS 7626/7676.  It is based on
the SP-207 design but using parts scrounged from various sources.  See

<li>Power transformer. This I bought off of eBay. It was 'parted out'
 of a klystron supply. It was spec'd at 2160 VAC RMS with a center
 tap. You really want at least 2800 volts peak out at the desired load
 current. This one was rated at 65 mA. Another important consideration
 for the transformer is the isolation or 'test' voltage from the
 secondary to the case. Depending on where the supply ground point is
 placed, very high voltages can appear on the transformer secondary. I
 deliberately chose to place the ground point at the center of the
 capacitor doubler point, thus grounding one end of the secondary and
 that meant that the other end only sees +/- Vpeak. Just to get a
 little extra out of the supply, a 12 VAC 1.2 A Radio Shack transformer
 was added to the primary side in a 'boost' configuration.
<p>
<li>Filter capacitors. I got 4 capacitors and 10 HV diodes (spares)
 from an appliance repair outfit. (Call Chris at 716-856-4057. The caps
 were $10 each and the diodes $1 each.) The capacitors are 1.0 uF at
 2,100 VAC. Conveniently, each cap also has an internal 10 Megohm
 bleeder resistor. You want 4 matched values. One cap was 1.05 uF but
 that's close enough! Note that when mounting the caps, the cases
 should be treated as 'hot' and well insulated from ground and from
 each other. While each cap is rated 2100 VAC, you can't assume the
 breakdown voltage to the case is any higher than that. I couldn't
 figure out if either lead was closer electrically to the case.
<p>
<li>Diodes - all HV diodes are HVR-1X from the appliance guy. These
 are terrific diodes rated 9 to 12 kV at 0.5 amp.
<p>
<li>Other small parts - all parts from
 <A HREF="http://www.digikey.com/">DigiKey</A> or
 <A HREF="http://www.tubesandmore.com/">Antique Electronic Supply</A> (AES is a
 great source for small value HV caps to 10 kV and high value
 resistors). These circuits are built on perf board with no solder pads
 - this gives the highest insulation properties. Boards are mounted
 with nylon screws to a sheet of Plexiglas.
<p>
<li>The regulator board is lifted right out of the 207 except the base
 resistor to the Darlington is increased in value to give more headroom
 for the Darlington regulator. Separate heat sinks are used for each
 transistor. They are well spaced from each other, and the 75K ohm base
 resistors are spaced away from the board for better heat dissipation
 and less heat going into the phenolic, which doesn't handle heat
 well. The extra cathode ballast resistor was found unnecessary and
 removed - but it might be wise to leave it as protection for the power
 supply against short circuits and other faults.
<p>
<li>The starter is modified from the SP-207 design to eliminate the spark
 gap, but is an otherwise standard design. When constructing the
 starter, soldered connections were made as follows: A small horizontal
 (3/32") loop is formed in the end of one connecting lead. All other
 connecting leads are formed at right angles and cut short to bend down
 where they enter the loop. Finally, the loop is soldered with plenty
 of solder to form a ball out of the loop, covering the sharp ends of
 the leads. This prevents corona discharges

<h3>Introduction to Inverter Based Power Supply Schematics</h3>

Most of these inverter designs run on low voltage DC.  Commercial units that
are powered from rectified/filtered line voltage are common - but almost
always potted, and solid as, well, a brick!  There is no chance of disassembly
using any technique short of explosives.  However, I did find one sample of
a design that may be similar (IC-HI2).  On the other hand, the use of low
voltage DC does have its benefits as spectacular failures are a lot less
likely!
<p>
Those with "Sam's" in the title were built using mostly scrounged parts like
flyback transformers that had been minding their own business in various
storage cabinets often for many many years.  My total cost for the remaining
components for each power supply was generally not over $5.

<h3>Simple Inverter Type Power Supply for HeNe Laser</h3>

This 2 transistor inverter is capable of driving a variety of medium to high
voltage applications from a 6 to 12 V, 2 to 3 A DC power supply, or auto or
marine battery.  I have used variations of this basic circuit to generate
over 12,000 V for high voltage discharge experiments, test flyback (LOPT)
transformers, and power normal and cold cathode fluorescent tubes.
<p>
Here, the general design has been customized for use with small (.5 to 5 mW)
HeNe laser tubes requiring between about 1,100 and 2,000 VDC at 3 to 6 mA
(and possibly higher).
<p>
The inverter drive and multiplier starting circuits (if used) are similar to
plans a couple of small HeNe laser power supplies found in the book: "Build
your own working Fiberoptic, Infrared, & Laser Space-Age Projects", Robert E.
Iannini, TAB books, 1987, ISBN 0-8306-2724-3 [3].
<p>
With the designs below, all parts should be available without being tied to
the supplier listed in the book (Information Unlimited, assuming they
still even have these parts.  This mainly concerns the ferrite transformer
since no real specifications are provided).  However, there is something to
be said for buying something off-the-shelf and not having to modify or wind
your own transformer!
<p>
Another Iannini book, "Build your own Laser, Phaser, Ion Ray Gun & Other
Working Space Age Projects", TAB Books, 1983, ISBN: 0-8306-0204-6, ISBN:
0-8306-0604-1 (paperback) [2], also has plans for a small HeNe laser power
supply similar to one in the other book.  However, it DOES provide complete
construction information for the ferrite transformer (including manufacturer
and part numbers for the bobbin and core - assuming they still exist).
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsgi">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe
Laser Power Supplies</A> for a way to use this inverter design without a
separate starting circuit.

<h3>Simple Inverter Type Power Supply Design Options</A></h3>

Two alternatives are described.  These differ primarily in the details of the
high voltage secondary winding, rectifier/filter components, and whether a
separate starting circuit is required:
<ol>
<li>The transformer is totally custom but well specified using the core from
   a small B/W TV or monochrome computer monitor flyback transformer.  Three
   sets of windings are added but this is not really difficult - just slightly
   time consuming for the 1800 turn output winding if you don't have a coil
   winding machine.  Since the output is relatively high voltage, some care in
   distributing and insulating the wire will be necessary.
<p>
   Lower voltage rectifiers and filter capacitors can be used but a separate
   starting circuit (e.g., voltage multiplier) will be needed for all tubes.
<p>
   See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdsit3">Starting Circuit for Simple Inverter Type Power Supply
   for HeNe Laser</A> for a multiplier type starting circuit for this system.
<p>
<li>The transformer is constructed using the core and high voltage secondary
   (intact) from a small B/W TV or computer monitor flyback transformer.  Two
   sets of windings are added but these are only a few turns each.  Note: the
   flyback must *not* have an internal high voltage rectifier.  If the primary
   windings are not shorted, they can be ignored.
<p>
   As an added bonus, with the flyback's HV secondary, there may be no need
   for a separate starting circuit.  Since it will have 3,000 or 4,000 turns
   (compared to 1,800 turns for your homemade high votlage winding), the
   no-load voltage will be much greater and should provide enough output
   for tubes requiring less than about 8 kV starting voltage.  Higher voltage
   rectifiers and filter capacitors are required but construction is greatly
   simplified by the elimination of the starting circuit.  Where greater
   starting voltage is required, a smaller multiplier (2 or 3 stages) will
   likely be sufficient.
<p>
   This is far and away the easiest approach since no tedious and time
   consuming thousand+ turn coil winding is then required.  I recommend you
   try this first as it will save a great deal of time and effort.
<p>
   See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsgi">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe
   Laser Power Supplies</A> for details on a high compliance design requiring
   no separate starting circuit.
</ol>
The basic design including all primary side components is identical for both
approaches.  The schematic shows D3, D4, C1, C2, specifically for the custom
wound HV winding (1) above and described in the text which follows.

<h4><A NAME="hscsit2">Notes on Simple Inverter Type Power Supply for HeNe
 Laser</A></h4>

<ol>
<li>T1 is constructed on the ferrite core of a small B/W TV or monochrome
 computer monitor flyback transformer or one that is similar.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If using a salvaged flyback, remove the core clamp or bolts and separate
  the core pieces.  Save the plastic core gap spacers for later use.
<p>
 <li>It may be possible to use the high voltage secondary intact if it is in
  good condition.  However, the flyback must *not* have an internal high
  voltage rectifier if a doubler (may be required to achieve sufficient
  output for a high compliance design) is used for the operating voltage
  or multiplier type starting circuit is used.
<p>
 <li>The D (drive) and F (feedback) windings for T1 are wound using appropriate
  size magnet wire (if available - hookup wire will work in a pinch) close
  to the core.  If possible, these should go on first *under* the high
  voltage secondary.  If not, wind them on the opposite leg of the core.
<p>
 <li>Insulate the core and then wind the D and F windings adjacent to each
  other.  Bring the coil ends and centertap out one end and insulate them
  from the windings they cross.  Make sure all the turns of each winding
  are wound in the same direction (both halves).
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you are using the original HV winding, depending on its original
   construction and whether you extracted the internal primary windings, it
   may slip over the D and F windings.
<p>
  <li>If you are adding your own HV (high voltage) winding, use a close fitting
   plastic or cardboard tube or roll of paper on top of the primary windings
   to provide a smooth uniform insulating form for the O winding.
<p>
   Build up the 1,800 turn HV winding in multiple layers of about 200
   turns where each is a single layer of wire.  Use thin insulating (mylar)
   tape between layers.  Make sure the start and ends of this winding are
   well insulated from all windings, the core, and everything else.  Wrap the
   outside with electrical tape to insulate it as well.   
  </ul>
<p>
 <li>Reassemble the core with its plastic spacers or add your own.  With a
  core air-gap of .25 mm, the switching frequency is about 10 kHz.  Selecting
  the core gap size is one means of fine tuning operation.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>The transistors I used were 2SC1826s but are not critical.  Others such as
 the common 2N3055 or MJE3055T types should also work.  Any fast switching
 NPN power transistor with Vceo > 100 V, Ic > 3 A, and Hfe > 15 should work.
 For PNP types, reverse the polarity of the power supply and D1 and D2.
<p>
 For continuous operation at higher power levels, a pair of good heatsinks
 will be required.
<p>
<li>Diodes D3 and D4 must be at least 3 kV PIV for an 1,800 turn HV winding
 or 10 kV PIV using the original flyback's HV secondary.  Fast recovery
 types would be better but normal rectifiers seem to work.  If diodes with
 the required PIV rating are not available, build them up from 1 kV diodes
 paralleled with 10 M resistors to balance the voltage drops.  For testing,
 I have been simply using strings of 1N4007s without apparent problems.
 Your mileage may vary.  Some commercial power supplies seem to omit the
 equalizing components as well and get away with it.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsces1">Edmund Scientific HeNe Laser Power
 Supply</A>.
<p>
<li>Capacitors C1 and C2 must be at rated at least 1.5 kV for an 1,800 turn
 HV winding or 5 kV using the original flyback's HV secondary.  Where
 capacitors with these ratings are not available, construct them from
 several lower voltage capacitors in series with 2.2 M resistors to
 balance the voltage drops due to unequal capacitor leakage.
<p>
<li>Some experimentation with component values may improve performance for
 your application.
<p>
<li>When testing, use a variable power supply so you get a feel for how much
 output voltage is produced for each input voltage.  Component values are
 not critical but behavior under varying input/output voltage and load
 conditions will be affected by C1, the number of turns on each of the
 windings of T1, the gap of the core of T1, and the gain of your particular
 transistor.  If the circuit does not start oscillating, interchange the
 F winding connections to Q1 and Q2.
<p>
<li>Add a post-regulator to this supply if desired to stabilize the current
 since the inverter itself is not very well regulated.
<p>
<li>WARNING: Output is high voltage and dangerous.  Take appropriate
 precautions.

<h3><A NAME="hscsit3">Starting Circuit for Simple Inverter Type Power Supply

A voltage multiplier based design is shown.  Other approaches can be used as
well - pulse trigger or wide compliance operation.  See the chapter:

section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsgi">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power

<p>
This is called a 'parasitic multiplier' since it feeds off of the main supply
and is only really active during starting when no current is flowing in the
HeNe tube.

</PRE>
X. Y, and G refer to the corresponding points on the schematic above or other
sample circuits in this document.
<p>
With 7 diodes, HV(peak) is approximately (X(peak) * 8) + Y and HV(average) is
(X(peak) * 7) + Y.  For small tubes, fewer stages can be used.  Increasing the
number of stages beyond what is shown may not boost output that much as the
losses due to diode and stray capacitance and leakage begin to dominate.
<p>
For the high frequency inverter, typical capacitor values are 100 pF.
<p>
The voltage ratings of the diodes and capacitors must be greater than the
p-p output of the inverter.  The value of R1 can generally be increased to
10M without affecting starting.  A higher value is desirable to minimize
ripple in the operating current once the tube fires.

<h4><A NAME="hscsit4">Notes on Voltage Multiplier Starting Circuit</A></h4>

<ol>
<li>Construction must take into consideration that almost 15 kV (in this case)
   may be available at the output should the tube not start or accidentally
   become disconnected.  Layout the circuitry so that parts with significant
   voltage differences are widely separated and try to avoid sharp points in
   the wiring and solder connections.
<p>
   Perforated prototyping board or any other well insulated material can be
   used.  Smooth out all HV connections - avoid sharp points by using extra
   solder.  A conformal coating of high voltage sealer is also recommended
   after the circuit has been constructed and tested.  Together, these will
   minimize the tendency for corona - which can greatly reduce the available
   starting voltage (particularly on damp days).
<p>
<li>Diodes D1 to D7 must be rated at least 3 kV.  Fast recovery types are
   probably required.  (The multiplier described in the section:
   <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg1">Sam's Small Line Powered HeNe Laser Power
   Supply (SG-HL1)</A> using normal 1N4007s does not appear to generate
   adequate starting voltage when driven by this inverter).  If 3 kV diodes
   are not available, build them up from four 1 kV diodes (to add margin if no
   equalizing resistors and capacitors are used).
<p>
<li>Capacitors C1 to C7 are 100 pF 3 kV disk type.

<h2>Commercial Inverter Driven Power Supplies</h2>

Unfortanately most modern high quality commercial HeNe laser power
supplies are in the form of potted 'bricks'.  These might as well be
encased in solid granite as they are (to the best of my knowledge and
experience) impossible to reverse engineer.  The circuit designs are
closely guarded trade secrets.
<p>
Therefore, at present, there are really no samples of those.  However,
there are enough circuits here to provide at least the flavor of what
they would be like, and several are probably very similar.

<h3>HeNe Inverter Power Supply Using PWM Controller IC (IC-HI1)</h3>

This power supply was found in a barcode scanner driving a 0.5 mW, 135 mm long
HeNe tube.  (See the section: <A HREF="laserlia.htm#liabcsm">Metrologic Model
MH290 Hand-Held Barcode Scanner</A> for a brief description of the scanner.)
The entire HeNe laser (tube and power supply) is about 1"x1.5"x5.5" and weighs
only about 3-1/2 ounces!
<p>
Fortunately, only the high voltage section was potted and some icky
disgusting rubber material was used which could be removed by picking,
chewing, clawing, and scraping, without any serious damage to the underlying
circuitry.  (Depending on the particular sample, removal may be much easier
with the entire wad of potting material simply peeling off in one piece.)
This is a very compact power supply PCB with total dimensions
of approximately: 3/4" (W) x 1/2" (H) x 5" (D).
<p>
The input voltage range is about 8 to 15 VDC though the minimum will depend
on the size of the HeNe tube powered.  The output is current regulated and
fully protected against a variety of fault conditions.
<p>
The power supply has been tested on a variety of HeNe tubes up to 2 mW:
<p>
<ul>
<li>For a 0.5 mW, 135 mm tube, nothing becomes excessively hot and continuous
 operation is probably possible though a small heatsink won't hurt.  Output
 voltage is about 1,300 VDC.  This size tube is what the power supply came
 with for its intended use as part of a barcode scanner.
<p>
<li>A 1 mW, 150 mm tube caused the driver transistor and ferrite transformer to
  become quite warm but not too hot to touch.   The DC output voltage of the
  supply in this case was about 1,350 VDC.  With at most a small heatsink, I
  would expect the supply to drive this size tube continuously as well.
<p>
<li>It was able to drive a 2 mW, 200 mm tube (requiring about 1,750 V from the
  supply).  However, a heatsink would definitely be required on the driver
  transistor for continuous operation and the ferrite transformer would likely
  become hot enough to be damaged in a short time.  In addition, regulated
  operating current may be too low to maintain a stable discharge with a
  tube of this size.  Therefore, operation with tubes above about 1 mW is
  not recommended.
</ul>
<p>
The current was maintained near the calculated value of 3.2 mA in all cases.
<p>
The basic design is quite nice and could be easily modified to drive much
larger tubes.  The only non-standard part - the ferrite transformer - is also
relatively simple to construct (as these things go) with only two windings on
a circular bobbin in a gapped pot core.  For more, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg9">Sam's Modular HeNe Laser Power Supply 2
(SG-HM2)</A>.
<p>
The power supply uses an integrated circuit, the
<A HREF="http://www.st.com/stonline/books/ascii/docs/1431.htm">SG3524</A>.
This is a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) switchmode power supply controller chip
which incorporates a fixed frequency oscillator, ramp generator, error
amplifier and comparator, and output drivers.  The SG3524 provides regulation
as well as over-voltage and over-current protection, and other functions.
Through the use of these capabilities, this design should be quite robust in
dealing with a variety of fault conditions.
<p>
As a side note, the power supply in the Metrologic ML-811 HeNe laser
pointer is almost identical to this one.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscml2">Metrologic Model ML811 HeNe Laser Power Supply
(ML-811)</A>.  A sample I obtained had shorted out
on the HV side to the point of likely catching on fire - everything was
charred.  This was probably due to the HeNe laser tube, which had become
extremely hard to start.  Someone must have left the unit on unattended
in the hopes of it starting but the discharge eventually took place outside
the tube!  While the MOSFET had overheated to the point of its plastic case
cracking in half, after rebuilding the HV circuitry on a new circuit board,
<i>no</i> bad components were found and the laser ran fine with a replacement
tube.  Even the MOSFET still worked.  MOSFETs are tough. :)
<p>
If you want to construct a power supply similar to this one, the SG3524 is
readily available from large electronics distributors and places like MCM
Electronics but shop around - the price seems to vary widely ($2.45 to
$12.50!).  It's possible to wind the transformer (not easy but possible)
so this power supply is very reproduceable.
<p>
I have designed a set of printed circuit boards for a HeNe laser power
supply which is based on IC-HI1 with some minor enhancements.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg9">Sam's Modular HeNe Laser Power
Supply 2 (SG-HM2)</A>.
<p>
Estimated specifications (IC-HI1):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,000 to 2,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 2 to 4 mA (by changing resistor).
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 6,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 1,000 V.
</ul>
<p>
For the bar code scanner application, the <A HREF="ici1pst.gif">HeNe Tube and
Power Supply</A> were glued together and mounted as a single unit.  The red
cap at the far left is a feeble attempt to insulate the high voltage to the
HeNe tube (not covered by the gray rubbery potting material just visible over
the left half of the power supply.  You can still get zapped from under the
circuit board (as I found out!).  This unit used a Uniphase HeNe tube.
Another one came with a very similar <A HREF="ici1mgt.gif">Melles Griot HeNe
Tube</A>.
<p>
<A HREF="ici1ps.gif">HeNe Laser Power Supply IC-I1</A> shows the component
side of the power supply printed circuit board after the rubbery potting
material covering the high voltage section (left half) had been removed.  The
pot core ferrite transformer is just to the right of center with the IRF630
MOSFET next to it (separated by a filter capacitor).  The SG3524 controller IC
is located under the IRF630.  The bright blue and orange objects are the
filter and multiplier capacitors in the high voltage circuitry.  The high
voltage rectifiers can be seen above and below them.  The 99K ohm ballast
resistor (3 x 33K) is visible at the far left.
<p>
To power the original unit, the terminal marked "A" is plus (+) and "B" is
minus (-).  Positive power must also be supplied to pin 15 of the SG3524
(available on a connector pin as well and can be used as an enable).
CAUTION: This power supply is NOT protected against reverse polarity - double
check your connections before applying power!  The nominal power supply voltage
is +12 VDC but it should run happily on +8 to +15 VDC.

As a result of the sophistication of the SG3524, the overall design is really
quite simple.  The PWM controller is shown first followed by the inverter:

<ol>
<li>R4 and C2 set the oscillator frequency, roughly 1/R*C or about 200 kHz.
 This generates a sawtooth/ramp inside the SG3524.  The output of the error
 amplifier (Pins 1 and 2, -In and +In) is then compared with this ramp to
 control the pulse width of the drive to the switching transistor, Q1, which
 is enabled every other cycle resulting in a switching frequency of 100 kHz.
<p>
<li>The main feedback loop is from terminal CS (Current Sense) which sets the
 output current based on the voltage drop across the parallel combination of
 R7 (SBT or Select By Test) and R8.
<p>
 With the installed values for R7 (SBT), the sensitivity is approximately
 0.4 V/mA.  The voltage on the +In pin of the SG3524 will then be equal to:
 3.24 V - 146 * Iout.  The 3.24 V reference is derived from Vref (+5 V) and
 the voltage divider formed by R3, R5, R7, and R8.  The factor of 146 comes
 from the voltage divider formed by R3 and R5 when driven by CS.
<p>
<li>VS (Voltage Sense) is derived from a point about 1/3 of HV+ and will be
 approximately equal to: 1/3 * HV+ * 13K / 9.4M.  The -In pin of the SG3524
 will then be VS - 0.7 V or 2.77 V (Vref through the voltage
 divider formed by R1 and R2) depending on which is greater.  The 2.77 V
 reference will be in effect under normal conditions.  However, if HV+ goes
 above about 4,200 V, the VS input will take over and limit output even if
 no current is drawn (as would be the case before the tube starts or if the
 tube were disconnected or did not start).
<p>
<li>Once the tube starts, the set-point will be where:
<PRE>
                  -In = +In
                 2.77 = 3.24 - 146 * Iout (for the installed value of SBT).
</PRE>
<p>
Thus:
<p>
<PRE>
                 Iout = 3.2 mA
</PRE>
 The set-point current consists of two parts: what flows through R5 and what
 flows through R7||R8 which we will call Rs.  At the set-point, CS will be at
 -1.11 VDC.  Thus the current will be equal to:
<p>
<PRE>
                  -2.77-1.11     -1.11                -1.11
            Is = ------------ + ------- = -0.57 mA + -------
                     6.81K         Rs                   Rs
</PRE>
 or
<PRE>                    1110
               Rs = ---------------
</PRE>               Is(mA) - 0.57
</ol>

<h4><A NAME="hscic12">Notes on IC-HI1 Inverter</A></h4>

<ol>
<li>This is a flyback inverter where the length of time the driver transistor
 (Q1) is on determines how much energy will be transferred to the high
 voltage circuitry when it switches off.  The SG3524 drives the MOSFET's
 gate via D1.  Q2 is used to turn off the MOSFET quickly by discharging the
 gate capacitance to ground.
<p>
<li>T1 is a ferrite transformer wound on a pot core.  The overall dimensions
 are 14 mm diameter by 8 mm height.  The bobbin is 0.454" by 0.217".  (For
 some reason, pot cores are listed by outside dimensions in mm but everything
 else is in inches, at least in the catalog I checked.  Go figure. :)
<p>
 There is a core gap which is about 5 mils (0.005") for the entire core (not
 just the center post).  This may have an error of +/-2 mils since it was
 estimated by eye.
<p>
 Maximum effective V(peak) (since the output is not symmetric,
 this isn't really precisely defined): 1,000 V.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Primary: 12 turns #28.  The wire ends of this winding are just visible
  from underneath where they attach to the terminals.
<p>
  The primary appears to be wound first close to the core.
<p>
 <li>Secondary: 600 turns, #39.  This is estimated from an examination of the
  exposed wire end of the HV winding under a microscope compared with wire of
  known AWG to determine approximate wire size, the resistance of the HV
  secondary winding (45 ohms), and the dimensions of the bobbin.  It's
  possible that the wire is actually one size smaller or larger.
<p>
  I suspect that like a normal (TV or monitor) flyback transformer, the
  secondary is built up of several (single thickness) layers of windings
  (50 or so turns each) with insulating tape in between.
 </ul>
<p>
 To somewhat confirm the the turns-ratio, I measured the peak-peak input
 and output of the transformer while operating with a 1 mW HeNe tube: input
 was 15 V p-p; output was 700 V p-p.  (I'm assuming 750 V p-p with no load
 to obtain a 1:50 turns ratio.)
<p>
 I have since constructed a variety of transformers from salvaged cores and
 bobbins I had sitting around.  I didn't have one quite as small as the
 original - these are the next size up.  (If I recall correctly, this is
 the same size used in the ML-811, possibly because it runs on a higher input
 voltage and requires a larger number of fat primary turns of wire.)  The core
 is about 3/4" in diameter by 7/16" high, spec'd as an 1811 - 18 x 11 mm.
 There was no practical way to wind the smaller one by hand anyhow - even
 winding the larger size bobbins using my antique coil winding machine proved
 almost impossible.  For the initial experiment, I first tried using 6 turns
 without any secondary but this resulted in excessive current flow and loaded
 down the DC power supply I was using for input.  (This was before I had done
 a more careful analysis of the transformer and realized the 6 turns was
 probably too low.)  So, I installed a 12 turn primary which made things
 happier and then proceeded to wind layers of about 75 to 100 turns of #40
 wire to build up the 600 turn secondary that would be required.  I got as
 far as layer 3-1/2 at which point the wire broke.  So I called it quits -
 that would have to be good enough for an initial test, thank you. :)  The
 power supply fired right up (not literally!) but would only run the 0.5 mW
 HeNe laser tube at an input voltage of 14 VDC or greater (compared to about
 8 VDC for the original transformer).  This ratio is quite close to that
 accounted for by the missing 250 turns.  The drive waveforms were quite
 similar in appearance to the one obtained with the original transformer.
 I then added 3 turns <i>out of phase</i> to the primary making it effectively
 9 turns (since I couldn't get to the primary wound next to the core) to see
 if I could reduce the input voltage requirements.  This indeed resulted in
 the tube operating down to about 11 VDC and there was no indication of core
 saturation even up to 20 VDC (which is high as I dared take it).  I tried
 adding two additional out-of-phase turns but the transformer failed, likely
 due to an arc-over somewhere on the secondary - this wasn't exactly a thing
 of beauty and was falling apart anyhow.  But, the exercise had proved the
 feasibility of a home-built replacement transformer and confirmed the
 number of turns that would work.  Subsequent transformers constructed with
 9 turn primaries also work well on this slightly larger core (compared to the
 original) even with the large air-gap.
<p>
 More information on games with inverter transformers can be found in the
 sections on <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg9">Sam's Modular HeNe Laser Power
 Supply 2 (SG-HM2)</A>, which is based on the IC-HI1.
<p>
<li>This is basically a wide compliance design and all except the last
 stage of the voltage multiplier (which is mainly used to boost starting
 voltage) are active at all times.
<p>
<li>WARNING: Despite its compact size, the output is high voltage and
 still potentially dangerous.  Take appropriate precautions.

<h3>HeNe Laser Power Supply from Industrial Barcode Scanner (IC-HI2)</A></h3>

This schematic was reverse engineered from a large barcode scanner.  Well, at
least the printed circuit board was large - about 18" x 11".  It is a design
from Spectra-Physics for what may have been a piece of IBM equipment (there is
no manufacturer indicated for the system, just some of the components that
were labeled with SP part numbers).  It was intended to drive either a Uniphase
099-1 or Siemens LGR-7641S laser tube.  These are typical 1 to 1.5 mW HeNe
tubes operating on about 1,000 V at 3.7 mA with an 8 kV start voltage.  Now I
wonder why Spectra-Physics didn't supply the tubes as well - maybe they were
too expensive! :)
<p>
This is a nice sophisticated power supply similar in many ways to the one in
the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic1">HeNe Inverter Power Supply Using
PWM Controller IC (IC-HI1)</A>.  It too uses a PWM controller chip - a
Unitrode UC3840.  However, unlike that one which is very compact, apparently
absolutely no effort was made to reduce the size of IC-HI2.  It occupies about
half the real estate spread all over that 18" x 11" PCB.  More fundamentally,
IC-HI2 runs directly from 115 VAC rather than low voltage DC.  And, it is not
isolated from the power line - the entire circuit is electrically HOT!
<p>
Note that unlike the other inverters in this chapter, the input to IC-HI2
is 115 VAC (could also be 150-160 VDC but where can you get THAT?).  However,
by changing the drive winding of the transformer, using a different MOSFET,
and some other minor changes, it could be modified to run from your favorite
low voltage DC as well.
<p>
I have not completely analyzed the design, but it seems to follow the
guidelines found in the <A HREF=
"http://www.ti.com/sc/docs/psheets/abstract/apps/slua164.htm">UC3841
Application Notes</A> (the UC3841 is virtually identical to the now
discontinued UC3840.  The minor differences are summarized in
that application note.)

<li>The UC3840 PWM controller IC was a predecessor to the UC3841 as well the
 ubiquitous UC3842 and operates in a similar manner.  One of these more modern
 chips should be substituted if you intend to duplicate this circuit since the
 UC3840 is probably no longer available.
<p>
<li>Based on the values of R120 and C117 (Rt and Ct), the oscillator runs
 at a frequency of around 28 kHz.
<p>
<li>The inverter transformer, T103, looks somewhat like a small TV or monitor
 flyback.  It is assembled on a ferrite C-C core about 6.5 cm x 6.5 cm with a
 cross sectional area of about 1 cm<sup>2</sup>.  There is a .075 mm gap
 spacer between the two halves of the core on each side.

 drive, LV, and HV windings of T103 non-destructively (I would hate to ruin a
 perfectly good transformer!), a 10 turn coil of insulated wire was added,
 wound directly on the transformer's core.  A 30 kHz sinusoidal signal was
 injected into this 'test' winding from a function generator and the output
 voltages and phases for each of the other (internal) windings were measured
 using a dual trace scope.  To assure that losses weren't a significant
 factor, the LV winding was then driven from the function generator and the
 voltage on the test winding was measured - the ratios were consistent.
<p>
<li>The diode CR106 and its associated winding probably implement a snubber to
 limit the flyback pulse.  CR106 conducts only when Q100 turns off and the
 voltage on its drain exceeds more than 2 times the value of B+.
<p>
<li>Actual open loop output voltage calculations are complicated by the
 asymmetrical forward and reverse/flyback waveforms.  If anyone would like to
 volunteer an in-depth analysis, I will be happy to include it here!
<p>
<li>The closed loop output (tube) current is determined by the value at which
 the two inputs to the UC3840 error amp are equal.  The reference (+) input is
 the VREF of the UC3840 (5.0 VDC).  The feedback (-) input signal is a function
 (1/2) of the voltage across the sense resistor, R112.  So we have:
<pre>
                                    R113
                    Io * R112 * ------------- = 5.0 V
                                 R113 + R114
</pre>
Or, solving for Io:
<PRE>
                         5.0 * (R113 + R114)
                   Io = ---------------------- = 3.7 mA
                             R112 * R113
</PRE>
This, by no coincidence, just happens to be equal to the current listed in the
HeNe tube specifications for this barcode scanner! :)
<p>
<li>The spark gap, E100, is likely there to prevent the output voltage from
 exceeding the ratings of the capacitors should the HeNe tube refuse to start
 or become disconnected.
<p>
<li>In addition to the ENABLE signal, there was also a means of disabling Vcc
 (not shown) by shorting it to ground with a transistor.  Both of these inputs
 were coupled via opto-isolators (Hot Chassis, remember?!).
<p>
<li>WARNING: The output is high voltage and dangerous.  In addition, the
 entire circuit is line-connected - which is the much more serious hazard!
 Take appropriate precautions.

<h3>HeNe Laser Power Supply from HeNe Laser Pointer (IC-HI3)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hscic30">Basic Description of IC-HI3</A></h4>

I reverse engineered this power supply from something I picked up on
<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay Auction</A>.  It was described as a
1 to 2 mW HeNe tube with power supply but the power supply portion was
probably not functional.  I was attracted to this item due to the fact that
the HeNe tube looked so cute and the power supply presented an irresistible
challenge.  In <A HREF="hnptr1.jpg">Cute
Little HeNe Tube and Power Supply Clump from HeNe Laser Pointer</A>, the high
voltage portion of the power supply is on the lower left.  The black cap
attached to the cathode-end of the HeNe tube is actually the PWB controller on
a little circular circuit board conformal coated with black rubber.  (The
HeNe tube in the photo is being powered from an external supply.)
<p>
I really don't know for sure that this collection of parts is from a laser
pointer.  However, the <A HREF="hnptr2.jpg">Closeup of Power
Supply Clump</A> shows what remains of the inverter portion of the power
supply after the previous owner got done
attempting to analyze it or something. :)  The white object on the right of
the photo is a normally open microswitch which controls power to the unit.
Thus, it must be either a laser pointer, hand-held barcode scanner, or
something else that needs to be activated by a pushbutton.  It certainly
wasn't what you would compact, especially when the required battery pack
(probably 8 AAs) is included. :)
<p>
One nice thing about this circuit is that unlike some of the others in this
chapter, I am quite sure of nearly everything except the part number of the
chopper transistor (and that probably isn't terribly critical), including
the number of turns of wire on the inverter transformer.  How?  Because I
totally disassembled it and then wound my own. :)
<p>
The manufacturer of this unit must have been quite paranoid about others
wanting to copy it.  The part numbers were scraped off of the chopper
transistor and the 2 ICs in the controller.  However, a little deductive
reasoning (e.g., matching pinouts after tracing the rest of the circuit), and
the ICs turned out to be a common 555 timer and dual op-amp (probably a Cx558
where the 'x' is not known but shouldn't matter).  I am quite sure that the
chopper is a PNP power transistor but haven't matched a part number as yet.
It appears to be similar to a PNP horizontal output transistor since there is
a built-in damper diode across C-E.  I assume that the reason a PNP type was
used is to take advantage of the polarity of the 555's output!  A P-channel
MOSFET should also work with minor modifications to the drive circuit.  With
slighly more major modifications, an NPN transistor or N-channel MOSFET
could also be used.
<p>
Estimated specifications (IC-HI3):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,500 V.
<li>Operating current: 2.5 to 5 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 6,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: 1,000 to 1,500 V at top of ballast resistor.
</ul>

The above specifications assume operation with an input of a stable 12 VDC.
I wouldn't recommend going much higher without re-evaluating component
values.  Maximum available output voltage and current will decrease roughly in
proportion to input voltage down to about 5 VDC.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for IC-HI3 in PDF format:
 <a href="ichi3sch.pdf">IC-HI3-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
To reverse engineer this schematic required peeling, scraping, and picking all
the bits of rubber, white RTV Silicone, and other unidentified black stuff :)
from all the nooks and crannies of both the HV and controller portions of the
power supply.  This was definitely loads of fun.  Unfortunately, not realizing
that the inverter transformer was soldered to the circuit board, I accidentally
ripped that off as well (assuming it was just glued on - wrong!).  The primary
was still intact, but at least one of the connections to the high voltage
winding was no where to be found - thus the excuse to disassemble it and wind
my own.
<p>
Since nearly everything is known about this circuit, it would be quite easy
to replicate it or even modify the design for larger HeNe tubes.  Increasing
the input voltage is one option as long as the inverter components can handle
the additional voltage.  To run on the same input voltage (12 VDC) will
require increasing the turn ratio of the inverter transformer and voltage
ratings of the diodes and capacitors connected to its secondary.  The chopper
transistor will probably handle the additional load (the existing one doesn't
have any heatsink.  In fact, its tab has even been cut off to save space!).
All the electronic components should be relatively inexpensive and readily
available.  The only tough part (as usual) is winding the inverter
transformer.  However, with a bit of care, this can be done in about an hour
(described below).

<h4><A NAME="hscic31">IC-HI3 Inverter and Voltage Multiplier</A></h4>

The inverter is similar to those in many other HeNe laser power supplies.
This is is a forward converter (not a flyback type - no core gap in the
transformer) so the turns-ratio determines the voltage stepup ratio.  A
voltage doubler provides the operating voltage followed by a quadrupler for
the starting voltage (total of 6 * V(p-p) of the inverter transformer output.
The starting multiplier was mounted on a separate little circuit board.

<h4><A NAME="hscic32">IC-HI3 PWM Controller</A></h4>

The power supply includes regulation with current adjustable over about a
2.5 to 5 mA range (for the typical 1 mW HeNe tube - with higher operating
voltage, this would be more limited or vice-versa).
<p>
The basic control scheme uses variable frequency fixed pulse width modulation
(so not strictly PWM but close enough).  A 555 timer is configured in astable
mode except that Ra (the one that usually goes to Vcc) is tied to the output
of U2A, the control amp integrator.  It turns out that the pulse repetition
rate is more or less proportional to the voltage on the other end of Ra.
<p>
The HeNe tube current cathode return goes through a 2K ohm pot.  Its wiper
is compared with a 3 V (more or less) reference using one of the op-amps
(U2A) as a comparator (open loop).  Its output drives the input of the
integrator positive or negative.
<p>
As expected, if the controller is on and power is then applied to the
inverter, it first slams to full output, then recovers after a half second
or so.  However, if power is applied to both the inverter and controller
simultaneously (as would be the normal case), regulation is correct as soon
as the HeNe tube starts.
<p>
Actually, the entire affair is quite simple and effective (though purists will
turn up their collective noses at anything using a plebian 555 timer chip!).
<p>
When I received this unit (and after rewinding the transformer, see below), I
found that it would run only at an input voltage of about 5 V - which is
way too low to operate the HeNe tube.  I finally traced this to one input
of the integrator have a 2 V offset.  Guessing the op-amp part number (recall
that someone had taken sandpaper to the top of the chip), I replaced it wtih a
new old C4558 from the mainboard of an unfortunate (former) phone answering
machine took care of that!

<h4><A NAME="hscic33">Rewinding the Inverter Transformer</A></h4>

During the reverse engineering process, the inverter transformer got slightly
obliterated during a fit of over zealous ripping apart. :)  This, however,
provided the perfect opportunity to (1) precisely determine its construction
and (2) to try my hand at winding a replacement transformer.  Once I accepted
the fact that the transformer would not be usable again, the coil bobbin was
extracted (which was quite unfortunate for the ferrite core, which also got
smashed to smithereens) and the number of turns and arrangement of each
winding was analyzed:

<ul>
<li>Primary: 14 turns of #28 AWG wire on top in a single layer.
<p>
<li>Secondary: 950 (+/-10) turns of #40 AWG wire in 10 approximately equal
 layers.
<p>
<li>Mylar tape separated the primary and secondary.  However, the layers of
 the secondary appeared to separated from each-other only by a waxy substance.
<p>
<li>The E-E ferrite core is 3/4" x 1" with a 3/16" square center leg and
 1/8" x 3/16" outer legs.  There is no core gap.  The plastic bobbin is about
 5/16" square with an open length of about 3/8".
</ul>

To wind a new transformer, I used the horizontal drive transformer core and
bobbin from a B/W computer monitor (actually an ancient HDS video display
terminal should you really care!).  This was slightly larger but I didn't
figure that would matter much.
<p>
I have this absolutely fabulous wreck of a hand-cranked coil winding machine
(you know the one they sell in the back of ARRL handbook - probably.  I
haven't seen an ARRL handbook in about 20 years).  It supposedly is good
for winding weird shaped coils but about the only thing I care about is
keeping track of the number of turns (it has a counter of sorts)!
<p>
For wire, I used the coil from a large reed relay.  It should have enough for
a dozen of these transformers.  At first, I was just holding the coil in my
hand but after the fine wire broke when I accidentally dropped it, I clamped
a screwdriver onto the machine to act as a shaft.
<p>
The bottom layer was absolutely perfect - uniform with no overlapping turns -
but it was all down hill from there.  I gave up attempting to keep everything
nice and pretty but just made sure that the winding progressed generally in
the proper direction and ended up near the proper end of the bobbin after the
required number (100) of turns for each layer.  For insulation between layers,
I used that thin transparent packing tape (one has to improvise!).
<p>
After the required 10 layers (I gave it a few extra turns for good measure),
additional clear tape was added and then the 14 turn primary winding was added
on top.
<p>
The important parts to insulate are between the wire at the start of the
winding which must come up to its terminal along the edge of the bobbin (add
a couple layers of tape over it) and between layers since each 100 turns
represents 100 V.  I cut the tape so it just fit in the bobbin but made sure
it was snug against the wall at the end of each layer since that sees a 200 V
difference to the previous layer.  (The first time I did this was not an
unqualified success due I expect to less than total attention to these details
- it worked for a few minutes but then shorted somewhere.)
<p>
Here is the winding process in more detail.  First the high voltage secondary:

<ul>
<li>Solder the end of the secondary to one of the external HV terminals.  Use
 a couple layers of tape over the wire in the path to the center of the bobbin
 to provide added insulation.
<p>
<li>Wind the first layer as uniformly as reasonably possible starting at the
 wall where the wire originates (Wall A) and going approximately 95 percent of
 the way to the other wall (Wall B).
<p>
<li>Wrap a layer of insulating tape with a width selected to it can be made
 snug against Wall A and cover the winding from the previous step (again about
 95 percent of the way to Wall B).
<p>
<li>Wind the next layer as uniformly as reasonably possible starting where
 you left off (5 percent of the way from Wall B) to 95 percent of the way to
 Wall A.
<p>
<li>Wrap a layer of insulating tape with a width selected to it can be made
 snug against Wall B and cover the winding from the previous step (again about
 95 percent of the way to Wall A).
<p>
<li>Wind the next layer as uniformly as reasonably possible starting where
 you left off (5 percent of the way from Wall A) to 95 percent of the way to
 Wall B.
<p>
<li>Wrap a layer of insulating tape with a width selected to it can be made
 snug against Wall A and cover the winding from the previous step (again about
 95 percent of the way to Wall B).
<p>
<li>Alternate windings and insulating tape as in the previous 4 steps until
 the required number of layers has been added.  Then, solder the end of the
 wire to the other external HV terminal.  Add a couple layers of insulating
 tape wide enough to be snug against both walls of the bobbin.
</ul>

By staggering the winding and tape layers - not having them go all the way to
the walls - assures that there is adequate clearance to prevent arcing between
layers of wire.  Here is an absolutely fabulously terrible ASCII rendering:

<pre>
         Wall A                                        Wall B

</pre>
(W = the wire entering and leaving; o = winding turns; one half cross-section
shown.)
<p>
Now, wind the required number of primary turns on top of the secondary.  Space
them uniformly across the width of the bobbin.  For consistency, wind in the
same direction as the secondary.  Solder the wire ends to the external LV
terminals and insulate with another wrap of tape.  Install the ferrite core
and clamp.  You're done!

<h3>Electronic Goldmine HeNe Laser Power Supply (EG-LPS1)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hsceg10">Basic Description of EG-LPS1</A></h4>

This is a HeNe power supply kit sold by
<A HREF="http://www.goldmine-elec.com/">Electronic Goldmine</A> a few years ago
(I don't see it on their Web site now).  It is a basic inverter type power
supply for small HeNe laser tubes - 0.5 to 1.0 mW (may be a tad more).  There
is no regulation but between setting the value of the ballast resistance (R4),
a duty cycle adjust pot (R3), and the input voltage (12 to 16 VDC), a variety
of HeNe tubes can be accommodated.  For some reason, it uses a pair of
identical high voltage transformers (T1 and T2) with their secondaries
connected in series - perhaps these are also used in some other less
demanding application.
<p>
Specifications from manufacturer (EG-LPS1):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,000 V to 2,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 3 to 4.5 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 8,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulation.
</ul>
<p>
Construction is straightforward - it took me about 1/2 hour to assemble the
LPS-1 kit I acquired for $2.25 from eBay. :)  After finding a bad solder
connection in the voltage multiplier (which resulted in erratic behavior),
the power supply does work and drives my Uniphase 098-0 and Melles Griot
05-LHR-002 HeNe tubes nicely with a 12 VDC input.  However, assuming it's
operating properly, the specifications (above) are somewhat optimistic.
I couldn't get to a tube current of 4.5 mA using any combination of ballast
resistance and input voltage.  It just barely did 4.0 mA at 16 VDC input
and 100K ballast.  So, this one is probably best used for those HeNe tubes
with optimal current ratings of 3 to 3.5 mA.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for EG-LPS1 in PDF format:
 <a href="egps1sch.pdf">EG-LPS1-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The 555 timer drives a PNP power transistor (Q1, TIP30C) to chop the input
to the twin high voltage transformers (T1,T2).  The duty cycle (more or less)
and thus output current is adjusted by R3 but there is no actual regulation.
(Note that with the 555, duty cycle is more easily controlled for negative
going pulses - thus the use of a PNP transistor instead of a NPN transistor.)
This is basically a high compliance design which appears to be virtually
identical to the simple HeNe laser power supply kits sold by other
companies except that T1 and T2 are EI core ferrite transformers instead
of a single flyback (at least it looks like a flyback).  Operation is also
similar to that of SG-HI1 and SG-HI2.  The output of the high voltage
transformers is probably a few kV open circuit rather than the 10 kV or
more from SG-HI1 and SG-HI2.  The 4 stage multiplier provides up to 10 kV
(they claim) for starting.  Its high droop, along with someone larger
than typical ballast resistance (100K to 175K total from R4a
and R4b) results in a stable operating point.

<h3>Metrologic Model ML600 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-600)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hscml10">Basic Description of ML-600</A></h4>

This is the power supply from the Metrologic ML600 HeNe laser.  While the
sample I have dates from sometime around 1978 (at least, that's the date on
the printed circuit board), a very similar version is still available today
from Metrologic, Edmund Scientific, and elsewhere, for around $310 as the
"Build-A-Laser" kit (model ML801) or $340 fully assembled (model ML800).
(Actually, the cases on all of these are labeled "Metrologic Neon Laser" for
unknown reasons.  Helium just doesn't get any respect!)  It is a very basic
HeNe laser rated 0.5 mW, good for general optics experiments and as an oversize
not particularly portable laser pointer. :)  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclmetro">Metrologic HeNe Lasers</A> for specifications.
Metrologic has sold their educational laser business to
<A HREF="http://www.i-fiberoptics.com/">Industrial
Fiber Optics</A>.  Similar lasers may be found there.
<p>
The power supply is a very rudimentary switchmode type, a forward converter
running directly from the AC line with adjustable current but not using
feedback for regulation.  With so few components, it would be ideal as a
construction project (which, of course, it is in the "Build-A-Laser" kit) if
it weren't for that inverter transformer, T1.  However, I will eventually
determine the details of T1 and it shouldn't be that difficult to reproduce.
<p>
Estimated specifications (ML-600):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,200 V to 1,600 V.
<li>Operating current: 4 to 6 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: greater than 6,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulation.
</ul>

The ML600 I acquired had an interesting, but very dead soft-seal HeNe tube -
not surprising if it dates to 1978!  Replacing it with a modern tube brought
the unit back to life.  I used a 6" long, 1.25 mW Uniphase HeNe tube intended
for a barcode scanner.  A little creative mounting with pieces of vinyl floor
tile as spacers, cable ties, hot-melt glue, and swapping the control panel
and output aperture plate (since the beam exits the anode instead of the
cathode-end of the HeNe tube), and the unit is now the equivalent of something
between the model ML810 and ML820 (0.8 and 2 mW respectively) even including
a proper Class IIIa safety sticker (the original sticker was Class II since
the ML600 is only rated 0.5 mW and pretty much disintegrated upon cleaning
anyhow.
<p>
The only problems with the HeNe tube I used are that (1) it isn't as much
power as I'd like and (2) it has the somewhat larger divergence typical of a
barcode scanner design.  The beam can be collimated with a simple positive
lens (as is done in the barcode scanner application).  However, since the
PSU current adjust pot is near the low end of its range (set at 4.5 mA), if I
come across a slightly higher power lower divergence HeNe tube that would
still fit in the case, I will probably install that in its place.

<h4><A NAME="hscml11">ML-600 Inverter and Voltage Multiplier</A></h4>

The 115 VAC line input is rectified by bridge (D1 to D4) and filtered by C1
resulting in a B+ (named for historical reasons!) of 150 to 160 VDC.  (I added
the fuse - F1 on the schematic - as there was none present the originally!)
The B+ is applied via the drive winding of the inverter transformer (T1) to
the chopper transistor (Q1).  Feedback from T1 maintains oscillation.  The
configuration looks sort of like a blocking oscillator though I don't know
whether that is what it would really be called.
<p>
The adjustable resistance in the emitter of Q1 is used to adjust output
current.  With a typical 1 mW HeNe laser tube and 90K ballast resistance, the
range was roughly 4 to 6 mA.  However, this will likely be affected greatly by
the specific HeNe tube characteristics and ballast resistance in use so
monitoring the current during adjustment would be essential.
<p>
The output of T1 is applied to a voltage doubler and the 4 stage voltage
multiplier.  Note the use of pairs of 1N4007s rather than proper 2 kV diodes!
The original ballast resistance was a very low 44K.  I'm not sure why they
would have used this value except to minimize power dissipation - or how they
got away with it!  Modern HeNe tubes would likely not be stable with such a
low ballast resistance.  In fact, without this enhancement, the tube was
pulsating at about 15 Hz.  For my replacement HeNe tube, I added another 33K
resistor to bring it up to a much more respectable 77K.

<h3>Metrologic Model ML800 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-800)</h3>

There are apparently several versions of the ML-800 that differ slightly.
At least some include a 2.7 V zener diode between the base of Q1 and common'
to provide a more stable reference than simply a voltage divider from the
DC supply.  Q1 may be a TIP50 instead of an MJE3439.  And other part values
may vary as well.
<p>
The overall circuit for at least one version of the ML-800 (probably the
first, one which I have a sample) is virtually identical to that of the
ML-600, above and should have similar functional specifications.  The
only notable differences are the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>There is no current adjust pot.  R4, R5, and R6 in the ML-600 schematic
 have been replaced with a 43 ohm resistor.  The specific value will have
 been selected at the time of final assembly to set the tube current to
 the correct value for the specific HeNe laser tube being used.
<p>
<li>C2 in the ML-600 schematic have been replaced with a 0.001 uF, 1 kV
 capacitor.
<p>
<li>The ballast resistance consists of four 22K ohm resistors in series.
</ol>
<p>
Metrologic used to offer a "Build-A-Laser" kit for the ML-800, which was
also available from Edmund Scientific and elsewhere.
<A HREF="http://www.i-fiberoptics.com/">Industrial Fiber Optics</A> has now
re-introduced it as the ML-801.  The assembly manual includes the schematic,
and may be found on-line via their Web site.  Go to "Products", "Educational
Products", "Helium-Neon Lasers", "Laser (Accessory) Kits".  Or, I have a copy
at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/ml-801-reve-120113.pdf">Sam's

The schematic alone, extracted from this manual is at
<A HREF="ml801sch.gif">Metrologic ML-801 Laser Power Supply
Schematic</A>, with some annotation added.  They call the kit
ML-801, but the completed laser is supposed to be the same as the current
version of the pre-assembled ML-800.  So this schematic should apply to
any late model ML-800 you might have picked up from a street vendor. :)

Schematic</A>.  However, most of it also applies to other versions of
the ML-800 as well as other inverter-based Metrologic HeNe laser power
supplies, except that the part numbers and some minor details differ.
<p>
WARNING: The entire power supply on the primary side (to the left) of the high
voltage transformer (T1) is directly line-connected and especially dangerous.
DO NOT touch any part of it unless it is unplugged from the AC line and a
minimum of 30 seconds has elapsed to allow the main filter capacitor, C13,
to discharge.  Testing C13 with a voltmeter to make sure it is discharged is
also a really good idea!  The high voltage side of the power supply to the
right of T1 has much greater voltages on it, but the available current and
energy stored in the capacitors is small.  Touching the wrong points there
may result in a rather painful shock - resulting in dropping the laser or
some other involuntary reaction! - but isn't nearly and dangerous and the
AC-line side.
<p>
The ML-800 power supply consists of 5 sections:
<p>
<ol>
<li>AC line front-end which converts 115 VAC into approximately 160 VDC.
<li>Power oscillator which drives the high voltage transformer.
<li>Voltage doubler/filter to provide the HeNe laser tube operating voltage.
<li>Voltage multiplier to provide the HeNe laser tube starting voltage.
<li>Ballast resistors to maintain stability and control current to the
 HeNe laser tube.
</ol>
<p>
Each of these sections will now be described in more detail.
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>AC line front-end:</b> The 115 VAC from the AC line is converted to
 DC by the bridge rectifier consisting of diodes D1 through D4, and filtered
 by C13.  R12 limits the inrush current when power is first applied and R14
 provides a high impedance path between the power supply circuitry and Earth
 Ground, which is attached to the case for safety.  The fuse, F1, protects
 against catastrophic failure of the primary-side components.
<p>
<li><b>Power oscillator:</b> Q1 and its surrounding components comprise a
 self oscillating driver which chops the 160 VDC from the AC line front-end
 and applies it to the primary winding (pins 3 and 4) of the high voltage (HV)
 transformer, T1.  The 2.7 V zener diode, D3, limits the peak voltage on the
 base of Q1 to 2.7 V, and current flowing through Q1's emitter to ground
 produces a voltage across the emitter resistance consisting of R6 in
 parallel with R13 (R6||R13).  Since the base of Q1 must be greater
 than the emitter of Q1 by about 0.7 V for it to turn on, current flowing
 in its emitter cannot become greater than that which would result in a
 voltage drop of about 2 V across R6||R13.  This negative feedback
 implements current regulation of the peak drive to the HV transformer,
 and indirectly, power transferred to the secondary and current to the
 laser tube.
<p>
<li><b>Voltage doubler/filter:</b>  The high voltage transformer, T1, steps up
 the chopped 160 V from the power oscillator and drives a voltage doubler
 consisting of D6, D7, C6, and C10.  The output from the transformer is
 approximately 700 V p-p, resulting in about 1400 VDC across the safety
 bleeder resistors, R3 and R4.  C6, in conjunction with R5, C7, and C8
 filter the operating voltage.
<p>
<li><b>Voltage multiplier:</b> A small amount of the AC voltage from C10 is
 also applied through C9 and R10 to a five stage voltage multiplier consisting
 of D6 through D1 and C5 through C1.  This boosts the output voltage before
 the tube starts to greater than 7 kV.  However, once current
 starts flowing in the tube, the 1M ohm R6 and very small values of C1 through
 C5 render the multiplier almost dormant so that it contributes very little
 ripple to the tube current.
<p>
<li><b>Ballast resistors and HeNe laser tube:</b> The HeNe laser tube, like
 all low pressure discharge tubes including neon indicator lamps, neon signs,
 and fluorescent lamps, is a negative resistance device.  That is, the voltage
 across it <i>decreases</i> with <i>increasing</i> current (within the range
 that matters for continuous operation) rather than the other way around as
 in a normal resistor.  In order for the tube not to behave like a neon bulb
 in a relaxation oscillator and flash or pulse, but rather be stable and on
 continously, enough positive resistance must be added in series with the
 tube (and its negative resistance) so the net resistance of the entire
 circuit (tube plus ballast resistors) is positive.  The typical negative
 resistance of a HeNe laser tube is about -50k ohms.  Additional ballast
 beyond +50k enables the current to be controlled by varying the voltage
 across the ballast/tube combination.  In the ML-800, the ballast consists
 of R1, R7, and R2 (66k ohms in all).  This provides the stability.  But R5
 in the operating voltage filter gets added to that for a total of 81k for
 the voltage control of current.

<h3>Metrologic Model ML811 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-811)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hscml20">Basic Description of ML-811</A></h4>

This is the power supply from the Metrologic ML811 HeNe laser - claimed to be
the World's smallest HeNe laser based laser pointer.
Metrologic has sold their educational laser business to
<A HREF="http://www.i-fiberoptics.com/">Industrial
Fiber Optics</A> but until recently similar lasers were listed on the
Metrologic Web site, along with a green one.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclmetro">Metrologic HeNe Lasers</A> for specifications.
That claim may be true (I don't know) but it would be quite easy to reduce the
size still further using the same power supply design and the same HeNe tube I
found inside - a Melles Griot 05-LHR-002 (19 mm diameter, 135 mm long, possibly
a replacement).  The tube was mounted on spacers and a larger (25.4 mm
diameter, 150 mm long) barcode scanner type HeNe tube would fit easily
and many of these have similar power requirements.
<p>
Not surprisingly, this power supply is very similar to IC-HI1 from the
Metrologic model MH290 barcode scanner.  The type of application is similar
requiring instant on and intermittent duty.  And, the HeNe tube used is
the same one - the Melles Griot 05-LHR-002.  I don't know why the power supply
isn't identical except perhaps for the revision.  The MOSFET drive and current
regulation feedback are different and there is no voltage limiting - which
quite possibly contributed to the failure of the unit I have (see below).
<p>

<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic1">HeNe Laser Inverter Power
Supply Using PWM Controller IC (IC-HI1)</A> for estimated specificatoins and
more details on circuit operation.
<p>
On the ML811 I acquired, the circuit board under the voltage multiplier and
the insulating board under that were charred to a crisp, and the MOSFET was
cracked due to overheating.  Miraculously, all of the components (including
those in the crisped area and even the MOSFET) are still good.  My guess is
that a high voltage arc developed resulting in the conformal
coating actually catching fire.  Not surprisingly, there was no fuse.
Unlike IC-HI1, there is no potting compound on that part of the circuit
to provided added insulation.  Such a catastrophic failure would be unlikely
using the device as a laser pointer (with the momentary pushbutton) since the
user would presumably detect that there was no red beam and globs of black
smoke being emitted instead.  Of course, if they were so preoccupied with
their exciting presentation, forgetting to release the button would not be
out of the question until the onset of six foot flames. :)
<p>
I have since rebuilt the entire high voltage section.  I cut out the burnt
area using an Xacto knife and nibbling tool (about all that was left for much
of the area was the fiberglass!), and filed this resulting window smooth.
Then, I attached a piece of perf board using hot-melt glue.  To this, I
reinstalled the original HV components.  The solder connections are smooth
to prevent arcing/corona but I will eventually coat the area with HV sealer
once I'm sure the power supply is operating correctly.  I replaced the melted
IRF630 (even though it still worked) with an MTP8N10.  In fact, assuming that
the IRF630 was dead, I didn't even test it except as an afterthought and was
totally surprised to find it had survived.  How many transistors continue to
function when split in half?  MOSFETs are tough. :)  The  MTP8N10 is only
rated 100 V (compared to 200 V for the IRF630) but so far it has been happy.
<p>
According to the Metrologic specs on the ML811, the input voltage should be
between 12 and 30 VDC.  However, I have been unable to get the power supply
to regulate at anything below 18 VDC.  The original HeNe tube is still good
but won't work at any input voltage on this power supply.  It appears to be a
very hard start tube even on the HeNe power supply I use for testing.  All
other 0.5 to 1 mW HeNe tubes I've tried have worked fine - but not below 18
VDC. Above this voltage, regulation is fine at about 3.2 mA; below, the tube
flickers.  I rather suspect that this older ML811 (manufacturing date of 1992)
has different voltage requirements than the one that was on Metrologic's
Web site.  In fact, if I recall correctly, the inverter transformer in the
ML811 is slightly larger than the one in IC-HI1 (from the MH290 barcode
scanner) which runs on 8 to 14 VDC), possibly to fit the greater number
of turns of wire in the primary winding for the higher voltage input.
<p>
So, I contacted Metrologic via the email link at their Web site.  I was
pleasantly surprised that they got back to me the next morning with the info
that it <i>should</i> work down to 12 VDC with a well regulated power adapter
but that they ship a regulated 24 V, 600 mA adapter with the unit.  Hmmm.  It
wasn't clear from the response if the older versions were any different and
not able to run on 12 VDC or whether they really didn't know.  But, knowing
that 24 VDC should be fine, I dug up an old bedraggled power pack for a long
since defunct laptop computer, found a pot inside that affected output voltage
and tweaked it up to 21 VDC from its specified 19 VDC (I could have gone
higher but the nice Siemens LGR7655 0.75 mW HeNe tube I installed worked fine
at 20 VDC so why push my luck!).  So far so good.  The only things that get
warm at all are the ballast resistors and HeNe tube.  Finally, I fabricated a
replacement for the missing beam shutter and now need to repaint the very
battle weary case. :)
<p>
I now suspect that what more likely caused the meltdown than a momentary
lapse in concentration was that the hard starting HeNe tube wasn't starting
and someone left the unit powered on in hope of a miracle.  With no voltage
limiting in the power supply, it caught fire instead. :)

<h3>Metrologic Model ML855 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-855)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hscml70">Basic Description of ML-855</A></h4>

The Metrologic ML855 is a 5 mW HeNe laser.  Physically, it looks like a
stretched version of the ML869 or a really stretched version of the ML600.
The tube in the unit I acquired is a Melles Griot 05-LHR-140-274 with a
manufacturing date of 1995.  (The laser is dated 1996.)  It is actually
rated 4 mW minimum output power (by Melles Griot) but the sample I have
is listed as 6.3 mW after "burn-in" - whatever that means - and actually
tests a bit higher after a 1/2 hour warmup.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclmetro">Metrologic HeNe Lasers</A> for
specifications.  Metrologic has sold their educational laser business to
<A HREF="http://www.i-fiberoptics.com/">Industrial
Fiber Optics</A>.  Similar lasers may be found there.
<p>
The inverter portion of the power supply is virtually identical to that of
the ML-869, below, but likely has a higher turns-ratio on the inverter
transformer to drive the larger HeNe tube.  There is no precise current
regulation.  Rather, the tube current is set by emitter feedback of the
inverter transistor (Q1), just like in the ML-869.  For some unfathomable
reason, the high voltage multiplier multiplier feeds the <i>negative</i>
connection to the HeNe laser tube and this is fairly close to earth ground
potential.

<h3>Metrologic Model ML869 HeNe Laser Power Supply (ML-869)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hscml30">Basic Description of ML-869</A></h4>

The Metrologic ML869 is a 1.5 mW HeNe laser with built-in modulation
capability.  Physically, it looks like a stretched version of the ML600
with a slightly larger HeNe tube.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclmetro">Metrologic HeNe Lasers</A> for specifications.
Metrologic has sold their educational laser business to
<A HREF="http://www.i-fiberoptics.com/">Industrial
Fiber Optics</A>.  Similar lasers may be found there.
<p>
The power supply consists of an AC line powered switchmode section very
similar to that of the ML-600, above.  There is a turn-on (CDRH) delay
which prevents the oscillator from starting for 3 or 4 seconds.  The inverter
only provides coarse regulation and has no adjustments for tube current - it
looks like this was set at the factory by selecting Q1's emitter resistors.
The high voltage feeds the usual doubler/voltage multiplier (6 stages instead
of the 4 for ML-600) and includes a 3 transistor circuit which looks like the
typical series pass linear regulator.  However, it turns out that this only
provide regulation relative to the operating voltage as there is no zener
reference.  Thus, its main function is actually for the modulation (see
the next section).
<p>
Also, instead of the multiplier being in series with the tube as is most
common, it is in parallel with about 16M ohm between its output and the tube
anode.  A set of 3 HV diodes in series feed the operating voltage from the pass
transistors to the top of the ballast resistor.  In conjunction with the
large amount of filter capacitance (.08 uF) for the operating voltage, the
parallel starter arrangement virtually eliminates power supply ripple from
affecting the tube current and thus modulating the beam intensity at the
inverter's switching frequency.
<p>
My sample of the ML869 is of recent enough manufacture that the HeNe tube,
an NEC GLT197, is hard-sealed and in good condition but the power supply was
dead.  Replacing the TIP50 chopper with something from my parts drawer brought
it back to life and the HeNe tube starts and runs fine but I believe the
transistor is running way too hot.  So, unless my substitute transistor isn't
good enough (which is quite possible), there is still a problem).  Stay tuned.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for ML-869 in PDF format:
 <a href="ml869sch.pdf">ML-869-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
CAUTION: Don't attempt to test these Metrologic power supplies using a Variac
without a series light bulb or other means of current limiting.  Bringing up
the voltage slowly blew even a 5 A fuse (but not the transistor or any other
component).  However, I can switch the ML-869 on at full line voltage and a
1/2 A fast-blow fuse survives just fine.

<h4><A NAME="hscml31">ML-869 Audio and Video Modulator</A></h4>

The ML869 laser has some rudimentary modulation capability up to a variation
of about 15 percent of the output intensity.  There are a pair of inputs: an
RCA jack for audio (100 mV p-p, Zin = 8K) and a BNC connector for low
bandwidth video (50 Hz to about 1 MHz.  This is not even adequate for TV
(e.g., NTSC or PAL) signals.  Metrologic claims it can be used to transmit
black and white video, but at normal TV scan rates, the picture would likely
be somewhat fuzzy.  Then again, no one ever claimed HeNe lasers were great for
modulation!
<p>
Several amplifier stages buffer and boost the input signals before applying
them to the series regulator transistors - via a .03 uF, 3 kV capacitor!
There is no overload protection - exceed the allowable modulation amplitude
and the tube winks out momentarily.  It looks like at least some thought has
gone into flattening the frequency response as there are several emitter
bypass networks in the intermediate stages.  I have not attempted to measure
the response.
<p>
Power for the amplifier is provided by an additional winding on the inverter
transformer feeding a voltage doubler producing about 22 VDC.

<h3>Hughes HeNe Laser Power Supply for the Model 3184H Laser</A></h3>

This is a very simple design using the typical two transistor self-oscillating
inverter circuit with a multistage voltage multiplier for the starter.
There is no regulation so input voltage and ballast resistance will determine
the operating current for any given HeNe laser tube.
<p>
Based on tests with a 30+ year old Hughes laser head that was apparently
inteded to be driven by this power supply (see the section:
<A HREF="laserhen.htm#henish8">The Ancient Hughes HeNe Laser Head</A>),
12 VDC would appear to be the intended input voltage.
The oscillator consists of a pair of TIP33A bipolar
transistors (100 V, 10 A) and a toroidal ferrite transformer with drive,
feedback, and high voltage windings.  The drive and feedback windings are
visible so the number of turns could be counted.  However, the HV winding
is buried and I was too lazy to try to determine the number of turns for
it experimentally.  The 1,000 turns shown on the schematic is there fore
a guess based on the required output of about 2,000 V for the laser head
and the first two stages of HV diodes and capacitors being a voltage doubler.
(The remaining stages are only for starting.)
While there is no real regulation which compares against a reference, it
does appear as though due to the design, the current to the tube is
intended to be 6.5 mA at 12 VDC input, and is much less sensitive to
supply voltage variation than would normally be expected with this sort
of circuit.

<h3>Spectra-Physics Model 253A Exciter (SP-253A)</h3>

This unit is designed to drive larger HeNe lasers like the Spectra-Physics
model 124 as well as smaller ones like the SP-122 (a laser that is slightly shorter
than the SP-120 but built more along the lines of an SP-124), probably the SP-120,
and others.  (See the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp12x">Spectra-Physics 124 and 125 HeNe Laser
Specifications</A>.)  However, rather than providing the operating and
starting voltage directly via a HV coax like the traditional HeNe laser power
supply, the SP-253A sends high frequency medium voltage AC to a voltage
boost/start module in the laser head.  Thus, this is actually an inverter
type design that splits the functions between the power supply box and laser
head.
<p>
Apparently, there must have been a couple of power supply options for the
SP-124.  Most of these lasers appear to use the
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp3">Spectra-Physics Model 255 Exciter (SP-255)</A>,
a traditional HeNe laser power supply providing operating and start voltage
through a high voltage BNC connector.  However, some versions apparently are
designed to use the SP-253A exciter, a model for which no one (including
Spectra-Physics) seems to have any information or will even acknowledge exists.
<p>
The SP-253 is based on an AC line connected inverter using a chopper operating on
doubled peak line voltage (115 VAC power) or rectified line voltage (230 VAC power),
of approximately 300 VDC.  A 4 transistor cascade (with individual base drive for
each transistor from an associated transformer) is used for the chopper rather
than a single switchmode transistor which would require a Vcbo rating of more
than 1,000 V (which were probably rare or non-existent when this unit was
designed).
<p>
I have samples of the SP-253A. intended for the SP-122 and SP-124 lasers (labeled
253A/122 and 253A/124, respectively).  They appear to have similar if not identical
components but different wiring of the 7 pin laser head connector.
<p>
The SP-253A/122 puts out 3 different voltages: 225, 300, and 375 V p-p, at a
switching frequency of about 22 kHz.  Since the potted voltage
multiplier/start module in the SP-122 laser head only has 2 wires, I'd
assume that one of these taps is selected either based on laser model or
the behavior of the particular laser tube.  I don't see any feedback for
controlling tube current - the remaining wires on the 7 pin connector are either
the return for the output voltage and also case ground or were unused.
<p>
For the SP-253A/124 there were only 2 out of the 7 possible wires actually
connected to the cable.  The output measured about 350 V p-p, again a
squarewave output (open circuit) at a frequency of about 22 kHz.  To drive its
mating SP-124 laser head which requires an operating voltage of 4 to 5 kVDC
and a start voltage of up to 12 kV, there must be about a 15X and 35X boost
respectively for these from the peak-peak value (or twice these values from
just the peak).
<p>
I don't have a sample of the boost module for the SP-124 (it had been ripped out
of the laser head before I got it) but do have the one from an SP-122.  I
haven't attempted to power it yet and there is no practical way short of explosives
or X-rays to determine exactly what's inside.  If it were my design, a ferrite
transformer would be used to provide a stepup ratio of around 1:10 for the SP-122
and 1:15 for the SP-124.  This would feed a traditional doubler for the operating
voltage and a parasitic multiplier for the starting voltage.  Alternatively, the
same stepup ratio could be used for both lasers but with a different tap from the
SP-253A output transformer.  The module for the SP-122 is quite compact and easily
fits inside that relatively small laser head.  There is much more than adequate
space inside the SP-124 head.
<p>
I do have the pair of SP-253As so I may do some additional reverse engineering in
the future.  However, this is somewhat more complex than your typical linear HeNe
power supply with several unidentified components (including a large
multiwinding ferrite transformer) so tracing the circuit isn't likely to be
much fun.  I will probably see about powering an SP laser head via the
SP-253A/122 and the SP-122 boost module.  My SP-122 laser head has a bad tube
but the exciter should power the very slightly longer SP-120.
<p>
As noted, some of the circuitry appears to be missing from both SP-253As including
anything associated with current regulation feedback from the head.  There is a pot
labeled 'Current Adjust' but no means of sensing tube current.  There is also a
location for a pot labeled 'Filament Temperature' in the SP-253A/124 (I didn't
check the SP-253A/122) but no pot - or any associated circuitry.  I can only guess
that either some version of the SP-253A could also be used with a HeNe laser with a
heated cathode (modern HeNe laser tubes - anything after 1965 or so - use cold
cathodes).
<p>
When I obtained the SP-253A/124, I thought that maybe this was a design that was
less than entirely successful or maybe that I had the one-and-only prototype of
something that was never put into production.  But since acquiring the SP-253/122,
it is obvious that this must not be the case.  The SP-253A *is* compact and light
in weight compared to the SP-255. :)  If anyone reading this has more info and/or
a service manual for the SP-253A Exciter and/or this version of the SP-124 laser
head, please send me mail via

<h3>Melles Griot Lab Style HeNe Laser Power Supply</h3>

Sorry, I don't have the entire schematic, only the wiring of the power supply
brick inside the plastic case. :)
<p>
This arrangement is basically what is inside most modern commercial 'lab'
style HeNe laser power supplies - a standard brick model mounted in a box
with AC power cord, fuse, line filter, on/off/key switch, power-on light,
Alden connector to attach the HeNe laser head, and an interlock connector
and/or line voltage select switch on some models.
<p>
Turning a bare power supply brick into a lab style power supply for your
own pile of HeNe laser tubes is thus quite easy and highly recommended for
safety and convenience.
<p>
Many brick power supplies (like the 05-LPM-939) have a trimpot for
setting current.  Where multiple HeNe tubes are to be used with such a
power supply, providing access externally via a hole in the case (along with
current test points in the cathode return, not shown) may be desirable.  This
is especially applicable to lower power units where the optimum current for
compatible HeNe tubes can vary from 3 to 6.5 mA; most larger HeNe tubes use
6.5 mA so an adjustable current isn't that important for them.
<p>
This is the Melles Griot model 05-LPL-939 but is just an example - I assume
that their other lab style power supplies is similar.  The same wiring diagram
(with only minor component variations) should apply to almost any size unit.

<h3>Yahata Model HVR-C234H-1 HeNe Laser Power Supply (YA-234)</A></h3>

This module is a manufactured by Yahata Electric Works, Ltd. who calls it a
"High Voltage Unit".  This designation is often used for the HV modules in
copiers and laser printers but the HVR-C234H-1 is really a HeNe laser power
supply. :)  From the label, the input is +24 VDC at 1 A max
and the output is 2.35 kV at 6.5 mA - suitable for typical 5 to 7 mW HeNe
lasers.  However, the +24 VDC is nominal at the rated output.  The power
supply should be able to drive lower power HeNe tubes at lower input voltage.
I haven't attempted to push it higher.  An externally accessible current
adjustment (Iadj) has a range of approximately 5.2 to 7.5 mA.  There is a
"Trigger" input that turns it on (open, starts the tube) and off (pull to
ground).  The tube will also start upon power-on if the input voltage is
applied quickly (not ramped up).  But it does not appear to
restart automatically should the discharge go out for some reason.
Connection info can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsuca1d">Sample Color Coding of DC Input Power Supply
Bricks</A>.
<p>
The HVR-C234H-1 is not really a "brick" like most of the other commercial
HeNe laser power supplies which are potted in hard Epoxy which can't be
removed without using TNT.  It is in a two compartment plastic case with a
three pin connector for input and a pair of "Fast-On" lugs for output.
Only the high voltage circuitry is potted as shown in the
<A HREF="ya234p1.jpg">Photo of Yahata
Model HVR-C234H-1 HeNe Laser Power Supply Showing Interior Construction</A>.
The drive electronics are on the right (mostly hidden by the black heatsink)
with the potted HV circuitry on the left.  The inverter transformer can be
seen poking its body out near the middle with the head of the largest HV
capacitor visible at the left next to the white HV wire going to the output
terminal.  Since the potting material is soft rubber, it could be dug out
making it fairly easy to reverse engineer this unit.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for YA-234 in PDF format:
 <a href="ya234sch.pdf">YA-234-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The HVR-C234H-1 is based on the
<A HREF="http://edevice.fujitsu.com/fj/DATASHEET/e-ds/e427200.pdf">HB3759 PWM
Controller</A>.  (A Google search can be used to find the datasheet if this
link decays.)  This IC is equivalent to the TL494 found in many/most
PC power supplies.  A 2SC3855 NPN power transistor drives a ferrite high
voltage transformer and 3 stage HV multiplier.
<p>
Laser tube current is feedback regulated via the return path from the HV
output.  The way to determine the current set-point and range is to realize
that the error amp inputs +IN1 and -IN1 will both be at 0V when the loop is
stable.  The circuitry attached to ZD2 will not have any effect under normal
operating conditions (it's just for voltage limiting).  So, Vref/(R4+VR1)
will be equal to [V(C8)-0.7V]/R16.  (I'm ignoring the small current through
R7 since FB won't be exactly 0V.) At a tube current of 6.5 mA, V(C8) works
out to be about -4.2V.
<p>
So far, this is the only inverter power supply capable of driving 5+ mW HeNe
laser tubes for which I have the complete design.  Since nothing is hidden any
longer, it should be possible to replicate this design fairly easily.  The
inverter transformer is wound on a small C-C (flyback-type) gapped core.  The
HV secondary consists of about 1,600 turns on a 10 section bobbin.  (This
was estimated by injecting a 1 V p-p 40 kHz signal into the drive winding and
measuring across the HV winding with no load.)  The 30 turn drive winding is
under the HV winding with the feedback winding on the other leg of the core.
This would be a relatively easy transformer to construct.  Eventually, I may
see about building a replacement transformer using readily available
components.  This same basic drive section could be used with other
transformers for lower or higher output voltage or current.  Converting to
constant voltage instead of constant current regulation (for other
applications) would also be straightforward.
<p>
CAUTION: This power supply might not be fully protected with respect to output
faults as I found out!  It appeared as though an arc on the output (my wiring
wasn't very well insulated) caused a failure in the high voltage circuitry.
However, what actually happened is unclear.  I did have to repair the high
voltage winding on the inverter transformer but that damage may have been
done during disassembly.  The error amp output of the PWM chip was also
stuck at around +4 VDC.  It's possible this was the result of excessive
current frying the op-amp but it could also have been something that happened
during subsequent testing.  I replaced U1 with a TL494 from a dead PC ATX
power supply.  The obvious benefit of having blown up the power supply was
that I had an excellent excuse to reverse engineer it, which I might not
have done otherwise!
<p>
I've now mounted the repaired inverter transformer and rebuilt HV circuitry on
a separate board.  Testing with a 5 mW (actual power output) HeNe laser head
has been successful (once I trimmed some sharp points on the HV caps that
were arcing!).  The current is very well regulated and starting is instant.
Since the power supply is operating correctly as far as I can tell, and
without replacing additional components, I must assume that the only original
damage was indeed to the transformer or IC.
See <A HREF="ya234p2.jpg">Photo of Rebuilt Yahata
Model HVR-C234H-1 HeNe Laser Power Supply</A> for a portrait of this creation.
Not quite visible in the photo is one unadvertised feature: I added an LED
(and current limiting resistor) across the drive winding of the inverter
transformer.  Thus, it is obvious when this thing is powered up! :)
<p>
I have developed a PCB layout for a modular HeNe laser power
supply based on the YA-234 with separate Controller and HV Modules.  In the
future, there may be variations for driving smaller and larger HeNe laser
tubes (up to at least 10 mW).  Hopefully, I will eventually get around to
fully specifying parts that are readily available including detailed
instructions on winding the transformer.  Maybe I'll even find a supplier
for prewound transformers.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg8">Sam's Modular HeNe Laser Power Supply 1
(SG-HM1)</A>.

power supplies, dead or alive.  If you have any like this - or a bunch and want

<h3>Laser Drive Power Supply From Barcode Scanner (LD-BS1)</h3>

Sorry, only transformer info is available at present.
<p>
This is the power supply that is part of the scanning assembly of several
popular hand-held barcode scanners from Symbol Technology, including those
bearing IBM, Telxon, and Intermec brand names.  These power supply bricks
are covered with copper foil, are about 3/4" x 1.25" x 3.5" in size, and
were made in Korea for Laser Drive.  They frequently show up surplus
(I even have some power supplies and complete lasers for sale.)
<p>
They will drive most 1 mW HeNe laser tubes using a 91K ballast resistor,
though the intended application calls for the typical 6" tube from various
manufacturers with a fixed current of 3.3 mA.  An enable signal has to be
tied to the + input to instantly turn on the laser.There are two versions
that I've seen.  The more common one runs on 12 VDC (range of 10 to 14 VDC)
and has an auxiliary -12 VDC low current output. A less common version runs
on 6 VDC (range of 5 to 7 VDC) and has both +12 VDC and -12 VDC outputs.
The low voltage outputs are almost certainly for powering an RS232 driver
in the barcode scanner head.
<p>
About half of the samples I've tested will also run the slightly higher
power 1 to 2 mW Melles Griot 05-LHR-910 tube (removed from its 05-LHR-911
head cylinder) using a 91K ballast resistor.  (With the cylinder and
internal ballast resistor, it isn't always stable.)  However, at 3.3 mA,
the laser produces slightly reduced output power.  The other units will
initially power up but the input voltage for stable behavior will gradually
creep up over the course of a few minutes and eventually the discharge will
become unstable at any input voltage.
<p>
The internal construction of the inverter transformer of the 12 VDC version
was determined semi-destructively by literally breaking apart the brick with
a vice and large wrench.  The transformer survived mostly intact in one
clump so the windings could be analyzed.  The brick was otherwise totally
destroyed. :)
<p>
<ul>
 <b>Core:</b> Ferrite pot core 1815 (18 mm diameter, 15 mm tall).<br>
 <b>High voltage secondary:</b> 600 turns, #33, 12 layers, no inter-layer tape.
  This is wound first with very uniform packing.
 <b>Primary winding:</b> 10 turns, #23.<br>
 <b>Auxiliary winding:</b> 12 turns, #30.<br>
</ul>
<p>
With a nominal input voltage of 12 VDC, this is consistent with the needs
of these HeNe laser tubes, with a peak output of around 1,400 V from the
first stage doubler.
<p>
My guess is that the 6 V version is identical except for a 5 turn
primary using fatter wire and additional 12 turn secondary for the
+12 VDC output.

<h3>Melles Griot 05-LPM-829-045 Power Supply (MG-829)</A></h3>

Here is the reverse engineered schematic for the
<A HREF="mg829sch.gif">Melles Griot 05-LPM-829 HeNe Laser Power Supply
(MG-829)</A>, amazingly taken from an actual unit that was depotted,
somehow. :)  The input is 12 VDC, 9.4 W max; the output is 1.1 to 1.5 kV
at 4.5 mA.  There is a pot to adjust the output current, though I don't
know if it was externally accessible.  Not surprisingly, this unit is
made by Laser Drive.
<p>
Most of it looks like a fairly standard inverter supply.  Q1 is the main
chopper, turned on for startup by Q5.  During normal operation, Q1 is
turned on by T1 winding pin 6 and turned off by T1 winding pin 5.
DC current regulation is via feedback through the 7.5 V zener, D2, to
control when Q1 is turned off.  The output of T1 HV winding pin 10
is doubled by C4, D6, and D7 with C5 and C6 being the main smoothing
capacitors.  D8-D11 and C8-C11 implement the starter multiplier.
But the residual ripple from only the capacitive filtering
would be over 10 percent p-p.  Thus note the components near the output
between C17 and C18.  That is an active filter that has an effective DC
resistance of less than 10K ohms, but an AC impedance many times higher
since C15 maintains a constant voltage on the base of Q7 and thus a
nearly constant current through R26.  It thus cuts
the ripple down by more than an order of magnitude to meet the less than
1% p-p specification for this power supply.  In fact, the
resulting ripple is probably much lower, though possibly not low
enough to meet the low ripple option spec (if one exists).
<p>
Interestingly, that ripple reducer circuit consisting of Q7, R24-R26, R28,
and C15, is on a small mezzanine PCB in the actual 05-LPM-829, not the main
PCB on which everything else is mounted.  So, it may be an "oops" and not
a low noise option. :)  This is likely based on calculations
of the rate of decay of the voltage on C5, C6, C17, and C18 (for a total
of 9.1 nF) at the switching frequency of 20 kHz and a load current of 4.5 mA.
Using: V(ripple)=I/(C*f), the result would be a ripple of up to nearly 25 V
peak-to-peak (p-p)!  (You remember dV/dt=I/C, correct?)  Assuming a net ballast
resistance of 50K ohms, that 25 V p-p voltage ripple would result in 0.5 mA of
current ripple - over 11 percent of 4.5 mA.  Thus, it would seem
that the circuit is essential to even meet the normal spec of less than
1% current ripple.  It will easily reduce the ripple by a factor of
25 or more.  Perhaps, the original design called for the HV filter
capacitors to be of much higher (uF) value to provide all the
smoothing for normal (not low ripple) supplies - as much as 50 nF total.
So, it's likely that this was found either not to be practical based on
the space available (C5 and C6 would need to be HUGE) or the designers
simply realized that it would be cheaper and more effective to use smaller
capacitors and the handful of additional inexpensive components,
mounting them on the mezzanine PCB.
<p>
What still isn't clear is how Q7 is protected from the high voltage
transient when the tube starts.  It would seem that the voltage across
Q7 should spike to hundreds or thousands of volts since the base of Q7
would be at the same potential as its emitter until C15 had a chance
to charge - a long time.  Q7 would thus be off.  In fact, my test
implementation of a similar ripple reducer used a pair of NE2 neon
lamps in series across the entire circuit for protection, and they
always flash during starting and multiple times when powering off.
While the 2SC2271E would survive 180 V (the breakdown voltage of
two NE2 in series), there is no doubt that the voltage would go
much higher wihtout this protection.

<h3>Heathkit Modulated HeNe Laser Power Supply (HK-HI1)</h3>

The rough schematic shown in <A HREF="hkhi1sch.gif">Heathkit Modulated HeNe
Laser Power Supply (HK-HI1)</A> was reverse engineered by Tom of "Billiards
and Games" (<A HREF="mailto:rockola@southwind.net">rockola@southwind.net</A>).
<p>
This is from a Heathkit "Laser Trainer" (model number unknown, but
probably the ET/ETW-4200) and includes
an inverter/switchmode power supply for both the HeNe tube high voltage and
the modulator.  Unfortunately, Heathkit used their own part numbers for many
components so part values aren't available for most components.  It has
"mic" and "aux" inputs (bandwidth unknown).  Heathkit also provided a
matching laser receiver for this trainer.

<h3>VMI PS 373 HeNe Laser Power Supply (VMI-373)</h3>

This is the HeNe laser power supply
from <A HREF="http://www.voltagemultipliers.com/">Voltage Multiplier, Inc.</A>
used in newer Agilent (formerly
Hewlett Packard or HP) 5517B/C/D metrology lasers.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstish3">Hewlett-Packard/Agilent Stabilized HeNe
Lasers</A>.  It runs on 15 VDC and outputs 3.5 mA (fixed) at around 1,600 V.
VMI switched from using hard Epoxy to a soft rubbery potting material.
With a bit of somewhat tedious effort, this can be removed without requiring
the use of the type of nasty chemicals that tend to rot one's internal
organs.  <A HREF="vmi373p0.jpg">Photos of VMI PS 373 HeNe Laser Power
Supply and De-Potted Components</A> shows an intact VMI-373 next to
it's disassembled brother.  See <A HREF="vmi373p1.jpg">Photos of VMI PS
373 HeNe Laser Power Supply Circuit Board</A> for closeups of the PCB.
The input and HV wires are drawn in, as is the
the 50M ohm bleeder/voltage sense resistor because it didn't
survive the process intact.  The two pots broke off as well, but
in the interest of esthetics, they were glued back in place
(rather than being replaced) as I have no intention of attempting to
actually repair this supply! :)  The original
problem was no output and very low input current.  So, the chopper transistor
is not shorted but simply isn't getting any drive.  I rather suspect that
it may have been fed reverse polarity or the wrong voltage because
the previous owner of the laser may have attempted to power it but only
succeeded in blowing one of the main fuses.  However, I really don't
know for sure.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for VMI-373 in PDF format:
 <a href="vm373sch.pdf">VMI-373-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The VMI-373 is based on a UCC3802 current mode PWM controller IC
for switchmode regulation, with an IRF530 N-channel MOSFET as the
HV inverter driver, and an LM392 (comparator and op-amp) for current
and voltage feedback.  The HV section is fairly conventional consisting
of a voltage doubler and 3 stage (6 diodes and 6 capacitors) voltage
multiplier for starting, but it's connected in parallel with the output
(isolated with a blocking diode) rather than the more common series
arrangement. It also includes a ripple reducer circuit using an IRF610
(a 200 V N-channel MOSFET) in series with the output.  The ripple
reducer is essentially a simple active filter that doesn't affect the
DC current but virtually eliminates any residual AC in the output.
The operating voltage is also monitored, with an adjustable limite
via the second pot.  Both excessive DC and AC (such as due to an
arc fault) will be detected and throttle back the output.
<p>
There are three types of feedback implemented in the VMI-373:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Current regulation:</b> The current through the voltage doubler
 is compared with a reference in the op-amp section of the LM392, used
 as an integrator to vary the pulse width from the UCC3802.  The range
 of the ISet pot is approximately 1.2 to 7.8 mA.  Some careful excavation
 of the potting material could enable access to the current adjustment.
<p>
<li><b>Voltage limiting:</b> The operating voltage (before the starter)
 is compared with a reference to shut down the PWM drive if it becomes
 excessive (2.5 to 4.3 kV DC or a rate of change of 2.3 to 4.0 kV/s,
 depending on the setting of the VLim pot).
<p>
<li><b>Overcurrent shutdown:</b> A current of more than about 30 mA will
 disable PWM drive.
</ol>
<p>
These VMI power supplies are generally very robust, so finding one that
was certifiably dead and had soft potting compound making it accessible
for mostly non-destructive analysis was quite fortunate. :)
<p>
The VMI-373 is actually at least the third revision of the VMI power supply for
these Agilent/HP lasers.  The parallel starter may have also been used
to reduce residual switchmode ripple, though it's not clear that such
as approach has any real benefits over the series approach as long as
the drive current to the multiplier is limited.  However, it may actually
be less expensive since no large value filter capacitors need to have
voltage ratings above the maximum operating voltage.  It is known that the
earliest VMI power supply for these lasers, the model PS 148, had excessive
ripple - about 6 V p-p at the high voltage output, which translates into
5 percent or more current ripple through the laser tube.  This was generally
of little consequence except perhaps when the output power of the laser
declined after long use and became marginal.  Then, the resulting amplitude
ripple in the laser output might have caused problems.  Or, if the tube
dropout current started to approach the operating current of 3.5 mA
(again from long use), another 0.1 or 0.2 mA or ripple could have
caused the tube to refuse to stay lit.

<h2>Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power Supplies</h2>

This growing collection of inverter based HeNe laser power supplies using
a low voltage DC input may be divided into three varieties (so far):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Wide compliance flyback circuits (SG-HI1, SG-HI2, and SG-HI4).
<li>Simple flyback Inverters with starting multipliers (SG-HI3).
<li>Regulated flyback converters (SG-HM1 and SG-HM2).
</ul>
<p>
While any of these could be built from scratch including the inverter
transformer, most details are provided for SG-HM1 and SG-HM2.  These are
high quality power supplies derived from commercial designs.

<h3>Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 1 (SG-HI1)</h3>

This and the next circuit, below, are two variations on a similar approach
which take advantage of the high compliance/poor regulation of these inverters
for starting.  Thus, no separate starting circuit is required.
<p>
These are both based on small flyback transformers and run on low voltage DC.
For this, I use a very basic transformer/rectifier/filter capacitor power
supply driven from a Variac.
<p>
No starting circuit is needed because of the wide compliance of thess circuits.
With no load (tube not lit), the voltage will climb to 5 to 8 kV or more.  As
soon as the tube fires, the output drops to the sustaining ballast resistor
voltage for the operating current.  In essence, the poor voltage regulation of
the inverter represents an advantage and allows this minimalist approach to be
effective.
<p>
This is one type of design where monitoring of the input voltage to the tube
is possible with a VOM or DMM requiring at most a simple high voltage probe.
Parasitic voltage multipliers may not have enough current capability and
pulse type starting circuits produce short high voltage pulses.  It is
possible to clearly see the voltage to the ballast resistor/tube ramp up until
the tube starts and then settle back to its operating voltage.  For small
tubes, I can safely use my Simpson 260 VOM on its 5 kV range without a high
voltage probe though it may go off scale momentarily.
<p>
The only additional components required for the HeNe laser power supplies may
be one or two high voltage rectifiers and a high voltage filter capacitor.
Since this is across the output at all times, it must be able to withstand the
starting voltage but be large enough to minimize ripple when the tube is
operating.
<p>
Where higher current is required, it should be possible to parallel more than
one identical flyback driving the primaries in series or parallel from the
same transistor circuit.  Each flyback should have its own high voltage
rectifier (usually built-in) with their cathodes tied together feeding the
high voltage filter capacitor.  A pair of flybacks should easily be enough
for almost any HeNe laser tube.
<p>
CAUTION: I would recommend using higher voltage capacitors than those shown
unless you know that your inverter is not capable of reaching the capacitor's
breakdown voltage.  With some of these on a variable supply, 25 kV or more
open-circuit is quite possible due to wiring problems, no tube connected, a
bad or high starting voltage tube - or carelessness in turning the knob to far
clockwise!
<p>
I have also tried a 500 pF, 20 kV doorknob capacitor on design #2 (I didn't
have two such caps as required for design #1).  While this low value works,
it is a bit too small and results in about 20% ripple at an operating voltage
of 1,900 V and current of 4 mA with a 15 kHz switching frequency.  The minimal
tube current setting for stable operation is slightly increased.  At lower
switching frequencies it will be worse and may prevent the tube from running
stably at all.  A few of these caps in parallel would be better.  Or, use a
stack of parallel plate capacitors made from aluminum foil and sheets of 1/8"
Plexiglas. :-)
<p>
WARNING: Since the voltage rating of these capacitors needs to be larger than
for power supply designs with separate starting circuits, it is possible for
a nasty charge to be retained especially if the tube should not start for some
reason.  Stored energy goes up as V*V!
<p>
Note: The difference in energy stored in the filter capacitor between the
starting and operating voltages is dumped into the tube when it starts.  For
long tube life this should be minimized.  Therefore, a smaller uF value is
desirable for these high compliance designs.  I do not know how much of an
issue this really represents.  A post-regulator can be used to remove the
larger amount of ripple which results with samller capacitors.  However, such
a regulator must have overvoltage protection since at the instant the tube
fires, it will momentarily see most of the starting voltage.
<p>
SG-HI1 is based on the inverter portion of the design described in the
section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsit">Simple Inverter Type Power Supply for
HeNe Laser</A> but using the small B/W monitor flyback transformer option
instead of a custom wound transformer.  (For the doubler, the flyback must
*not* have an internal rectifier.)  The only differences are in the voltage
ratings of the components required for the doubler and filter capacitors (to
the right of points X and T in that power supply diagram).
<p>
Thus, it is an extremely simple circuit with no adjustments.  Power output
is controlled strictly by varying input voltage.  Only a pair of high voltage
rectifiers and a pair of high voltage filter capacitors for the doubler are
required to complete the power supply.
<p>
It requires between 6 and 12 VDC (depending on HeNe tube power and ballast
resistor) at less than 2 A and will power small HeNe tubes requiring up to
about 6 mA at 2,000 V, perhaps more.
<p>
Estimated specifications (SG-HI1):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,200 to 2,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 0 to 6 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 5,000 to 8,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulator.
</ul>
<p>
Here are sample operating points for two different 1 mW tubes:

<p>
The rectifiers (D3 and D4) should be rated at least 10 kV PIV (possibly higher
depending on the capabilities of your particular inverter).  (However, don't
go excessively high as the voltage drop across the diodes could become rather
substantial.)  In fact, when I replaced each of the high voltage rectifiers I
had been using with a string of 1N4007s, the tubes would run stably at slightly
lower output voltage (about 50 V less) and the discharge could be maintained
at slightly lower current as well.
<p>
The filter capacitor must be rated for the *maximum* no load voltage possible
with your inverter.  For testing, I constructed it from two .25 uF, 4,000 V oil
filled capacitors in series with equalizing resistors providing about .12 uF
at 8 kV.  With the components I used, the maximum no load output voltage was
slightly less than 8 kV with a 12 VDC input which is more than adequate to
start most smaller tubes.  However, capacitors with at least a 5 kV breakdown
voltage rating (10 kV total) should really be used.
<p>
The tube current may be monitored as a voltage across R5 (1 V/mA) or directly.
It may be varied by adjusting the input voltage to the inverter.  Using a
different ballast resistor value may also help to stabilize operation.

<h3>Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 2 (SG-HI2)</h3>

This inverter is the design from: "Adjustable High Voltage Power Supply"
in the document:
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/samschem.htm">Various Schematics and
Diagrams</A> which has additional info about this circuit.  Since I already
had the inverter, it took a total of about 10 minutes to convert it into a
HeNe laser power supply!
<p>
It requires between 8 and 15 VDC (depending on HeNe tube power) at less than
2 A and will power small HeNe tubes requiring up to about 6 mA at 2,500 V,
perhaps more.  With a 1 mW tube (1,900 V, 4 mA, 150K ballast resistor), the
input is about 8 VDC (probably about 1.5 A, not measured) and the switching
transistor heatsink doesn't even get warm. :-)
<p>
Estimated specifications (SG-HI2):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,200 to 2,500 V.
<li>Operating current: 0 to 6 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 5,000 to 10,000 V.

<p>
The high voltage rectifier is built into the flyback transformer.  If you have
to use an external rectifier, it should be rated at least 20 kV PIV (possibly
higher depending on the capabilities of your particular inverter).  The filter
capacitors shown were just for testing.  High voltage types are recommended,
again depending on the maximum output of your inverter with no load.  For
testing, I constructed it from three .25 uF, 4,000 V oil filled capacitors in
series with equalizing resistors providing about .08 uF at 12 kV.  However,
with the design as implemented, the maximum no load output voltage could
easily exceed 15 kV with a 15 VDC input.
<p>
The tube current may be monitored as a voltage across R4 (1 V/mA) or directly.
It may be varied by adjusting the frequency and pulse width controls on the
inverter and its input voltage.  Using a different ballast resistor value may
also help to stabilize operation.
<p>
Several companies sell a HeNe laser power supply kit using a single 555 timer
and what appears to be a standard small flyback transformer.  A single control,
presumably for 555 frequency, sets output power level.  This is likely similar
to a simplified version of SG-HI2.  And, funny you should mention it. :)
The section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg7">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser
Power Supply 4 (SG-HI4)</A> has a design that is probably similar to what is
in these kits.
<p>
It should be possible to add feedback from a current sense resistor to one of
the 555 timers to regulate output current by controlling switching frequency
or pulse width.  This is left as an exercise for the student.  Or, see
the next section. :)

<h3>Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 3 (SG-HI3)</h3>

The objective of this design was to create a basic inverter based power
supply which includes some regulation that could be built with common
components and a transformer that is (relatively) easily wound.  
<p>
At first, I attempted to use multiple inverter transformers salvaged from the
electronic flash units found in disposable (single use) pocket cameras.  These
are readily available and often free for the asking at your local photo
processor.  However, they are so small that it appeared as though at least
4 such transformers wired with their primaries in series and secondaries
in series/parallel would be needed to drive even a small HeNe tube.  While
obtaining the required voltage was easy, the available current at that voltage
was too low with only a pair of transformers.  So, I went to plan B. :)
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for SG-HI3 in PDF format:
 <a href="sghi3sch.pdf">SG-HI3-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
SG-HI3 uses a modified 555 timer circuit driving a forward converter with
a conventional parasitic multiplier for the starter.  Thus, this isn't a wide
compliance design but does have enough range to compensate for a variety of
tubes and variations in input voltage.  Regulation isn't great but is better
than nothing and costs virtually nothing. :)
<p>
The 555 is wired as a variable frequency oscillator with a more-or-less fixed
pulse width.  This is accomplished by injecting current into the THRES input
when the voltage across the current sense resistor exceeds about 12 V.  The
added current raises the 555's threshold to terminate capacitor discharge and
thus extends the time between pulses.  (There is some interaction with the
pulse width but it should be good enough without requiring a pair of 555s or
using an inverted output as with IC-HI3).  To keep this circuit as simple as
possible, no op-amps are used.  Thus, the feedback has no integral term and
thus there will be an offset error in the regulation.  Adding a comparator and
integrator as in IC-HI3 would eliminate this.
<p>
By using the RESET input of the 555, the power on/off could be controlled with
a logic level signal (EBL).  Putting a voltmeter between the test point
(TP1) and ground can be used to monitor tube current with a sensitivity of
2V/mA.
<p>
I have tried the ubiquitous 2N3055T bipolar transistor as well as an N-Channel
enhancement mode MOSFET.  I would suggest an IRF630 or better MOSFET though
what I actually used for the initial tests were the BUZ71A and MTP8N10.  I
did pop in a battle-weary IRF630 later on from my initially dead ML811 laser.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscml2">Metrologic Model ML811 HeNe
Laser Power Supply (ML-811)</A>.)  This appeared to behave about the same as
the others.  Both the MOSFET and bipolar options are shown on the schematic
but I would recommend the MOSFET as it is easier to drive and seems to run
cooler.  Some modifications may be needed to optimize the circuit if you
insist on using the 2N3055T or other bipolar transistor.  However, in either
case, a modest heatsink will be required for HeNe tubes above about 1 mW and
is good insurance when operating at lower power as well.
<p>
As drawn, SG-HI3 should be suitable for 0.5 to 2 mW HeNe tubes with
obvious extensions to larger ones. :)  At 12 VDC input, it will produce
5 mA at 2 kV or 6.5 mA at 1.5 kV.  I would recommend using a somewhat
regulated input voltage.  For small HeNe tubes, as little as 8 VDC at
less than 1 A may be adequate.  However, running at much less than 8 V input
is not recommended if a MOSFET is used as it may not be turned on fully and
thus will get hot very quickly.  There should be no similar problem with a
bipolar transistor.  In any case, don't let the input exceed about
15 VDC for the component values shown as bad things may happen. :(
<p>
The inverter transformer, T1, is similar to my replacement for IC-HI3 using
the ferrite core from the horizontal drive transformer of a small computer
monitor.  The only change I made was to increase the number of secondary turns
compared to IC-HI3 to give a small boost in output voltage (from around 1,000
to 1,200 turns).  Details on construction can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic33">Rewinding the Inverter Transformer</A>.  I've
tried it with no core gap and with a small (maybe .002") core gap without
any obvious difference in performance.
<p>
Note that the no load output voltage of T1 (before the HeNe tube starts)
may approach 3.0 kV p-p with an input of 12 VDC.  I assume this is due to
the parasitic inductance of T1 (even without an actual core gap) resulting
in a flyback spike.  Thus, don't be tempted to cut corners on the voltage
ratings of the diodes or multiplier caps!  However, this 'feature' may
enable one or two stages of the voltage multiplier to be removed. :)
An additional RC snubber across Q1 or diode snubber as used in IC-HI2
could be used to reduce the flyback pulse (and likely the heat dissipation
in Q1 as well).  However, in my admittedly brief experiments, neither approach
made enough of a difference to be worth the trouble.
<p>
First, I built just the portion of the SG-HI3 up through the voltage doubler
(but not the starter).  I did some tests using the HV power supply from an
electronic air cleaner gizmo connected in parallel with the HeNe tube with
SG-HI3 isolated using a microwave oven HV rectifier.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns9">HeNe Starter Using Electronic Air Cleaner HV
Module</A>.)  This approach worked quite nicely with a 1 mW SP-088 tube using
a 100K ballast resistor (only tube tried so far).  Plugging the HV gizmo in
momentarily started the tube reliably.  I could set the current between less
than 3 mA and 6 mA (nominal for that tube is probably 4 to 5 mA).  At 4.5 mA,
the MOSFET I was using (that partially melted split-in-half IRF630 salvaged
from my ML811 laser) ran warm but not too hot to touch without a heatsink.
<p>
Next, I added only 4 stages of the voltage multiplier rather than the 6 called
for in the schematic - I ran out of HV caps. :)  This worked fabulously with
that same SP-088, starting the tube absolutely instantly as soon as power was
applied.
<p>
I first built my prototype of SG-HI3 on one of those Protoboard things (you
know, with all the holes for push-in wires and components) putting just the
power and HV circuits on a separate perf. board.  Once it was working, I
transferred the 555 and feedback components to the perf. board with a
separate little board for the starter.  <A HREF="sghi3ph1.jpg">SG-HI3
Powering Spectra-Physics HeNe Laser Tube</A> shows SG-HI3 powering that
same tube at a current of 4 mA from a source of unregulated 12 VDC (a wall
adapter with an extra 10,000 uF filter capacitor on its output to reduce
ripple).
<p>
I have also created a PCB layout drawing (at 2X scale) shown in
<A HREF="sghi3pcb.gif">SG-HI3 Helium Neon Laser Power Supply PCB Layout</A>.
Since your components will probably not be quite the same as mine, this won't
likely be usable directly but can serve as a starting point for a layout of
your own.

<h3>Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 4 (SG-HI4)</h3>

This is essentially a stripped down version of SG-HI2 which I believe to
be similar to the typical HV power supply kit sold by a number of surplus
outfits.  It uses a small flyback transformer driven by a variable frequency,
fixed pulse width 555 timer using a pot for voltage/power control.  The kits
often allow for the HV output of the flyback to be used raw or filtered with
on-board capacitors.  It runs on 6 to 15 VDC (adjust part values/primary
winding) for other input voltages.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for SG-HI4 in PDF format:
 <a href="sghi4sch.pdf">SG-HI4-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The only thing at all unusual about this circuit is the modification to the
common 555 astable circuit to allow the output to be adjustable in frequency
but generating fixed-width narrow positive pulses.  This is accomplished by
isolating the charge and discharge paths for the timing capacitor with a pair
of diodes.  Varying the pot adjusts only the discharge (low) time, leaving the
charge (high) time unaffected.
<p>
By using the RESET input of the 555, the power on/off could be controlled with
a logic level signal (not shown).
<p>
Where a suitable primary isn't present on the flyback or this isn't known
(which is usually the case), it is wound on the ferrite core on a layer of
insulating tape.  Try both polarities of the drive winding - the output voltage
and current will be greater when the transistor turn-off (flyback) causes
current to flow in the forward direction through the HV rectifier (the dots
line up as shown in the schematic).
<p>
The high voltage capacitor, C3, can be constructed from a stack of lower
voltage capacitors if a suitable one isn't available.  It is assumed that the
high voltage rectifier is built into the flyback.  If this isn't the case, one
will need to be added.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdtoc">HeNe
Laser Power Supply Design</A> for more on high voltage capacitor and rectifier
construction.

A very similar circuit is also shown in the section:

SG-HM1 is the first of a series of HeNe laser power supplies that can be

but with separate Control and High Voltage modules, either of which
could be modified depending on the specific application.
<p>
Like YA-234, SG-HM1 is designed for 5 mW lasers but should run lower power
tubes if the input power supply voltage is reduced.  (Going the other way
is not recommended without increasing the ratings of the power and high
voltage components.)  I have added some additional protection circuitry (a
resistor and zener diode) which hopefully will prevent damage to the control
circuitry from output short circuits.  It should be possible to scale the
design up or down rather easily.

<h3>Sam's Modular HeNe Laser Power Supply 2 (SG-HM2)</h3>
<h4><A NAME="hscsg90">SG-HM2 Descripton and Schematic</A></h4>

SG-HM2 is a modular HeNe laser power supply based on IC-HI1 with some minor
enhancements.  The first version is for laser tubes up to approximately 1 mW
(2 mW with trivial modifications) but it should be straightforward to go
to 5 mW or even higher power tubes by replacing the SG-HM2 HV Module (HVM2-1)
with one with a higher voltage and current rating, along with a higher power
MOSFET and minor component value changes to the Control Module (suggestions
below).  I have added an adjustment for tube current, a current limiting
resistor and zener to protect against output short circuits, an enable input
(ground to turn on), a bleeder resistor to virtually eliminate the shock
hazard after the power supply is turned off, and power and status LEDs.

<h4><A NAME="hscsg91">Modifying SG-HM2 for Higher Power HeNe Laser Tubes</A></h4>

The following are guidelines for modifying SG-HM2 to drive various power HeNe
lasers.  The PCB layout below with two versions of the HV Module should
accommodate HeNe laser tubes up to 10 mW.  All assume input of around 12 V
though a higher power system can generally run lower power lasers at reduced
input voltage. If operation at rated power on another input voltage is desired,
the number of turns on the inverter transformer can be adjusted accordingly.
As noted above, the 1 mW HV Module (HVM2-1) should run tubes up to about 2 mW,
though increasing the uF values of some of the HV capacitors may be desirable
to reduce ripple at the higher tube current.  Minor changes may also be needed
in the components on the SG-HM2 Control Module including using a higher power
MOSFET for Q1 and reducing the values of R7 and/or R8 for the higher tube
current.  Or, just populate the Control Module with Q1 being an IRF644, R7
being 150 ohms, and R8 being 750 ohms for compatibility with all the HV
modules.  For that matter, the HVM2-5 PCB HV Module should be usable with
lower power lasers.

<h4><A NAME="hscsg92">SG-HM2 Inverter Transformer</A></h4>

The inverter transformer for HVM2-1 is wound on a ferrite pot core with a
small air-gap (about 0.005").  It is 18 mm in diameter by 11 mm high.  While
specified to use a 9 turn primary and 450 turn secondary, these values can be
adjusted somewhat to handle various input and output requirements.  Don't go
much lower on the primary as this may result in core saturation.  The 9/450
transformer should be fine for 1 to 2 mW HeNe laser tubes running on 8 to 15
VDC input.  With 9/300, it will operate on about 12 to 20 VDC.
Increasing the number of secondary turns (e.g., 9/600) may result
in operation on a slightly lower input voltage, but probably not by much.
The 9/450 transformer may even run HeNe laser tubes larger than 2 mW but
I haven't yet tested this since I haven't built a prototype of HVM2-5 as yet.
<p>
It doesn't matter very much whether the primary (P) is wound first or the
secondary (S) is wound first though the former appears to work slightly
better, running the tube at about 8 VDC input instead of 9 VDC input for the
same 9/450 transformer.  P over S is slightly easier to wind since the primary
doesn't get in the way and increase the lumpiness of the secondary layers.
However, with S over P, insulation is somewhat less critical since the HV
lead is out away from anything else.  With the P over S, additional
isulation is needed between them.  Also, since the primary coil is larger
diameter, it will have more resistance and there will be greater inter-winding
capacitance (though probaly not significant).   The secondary should be
constructed as multiple layers of about 50 or 60 turns each, with insulating
tape between layers.  Each should be wound in as close to a single layer as
possible with alternating layers staggered to prevent arc-over.  This doesn't
have to be perfect but try to go gradually from one side to the other to keep
wires at high relative potential away from each other.  Make sure the HV output
leads (particularly the one away from the dot) are well insulated as they exit
the transformer.  And, as noted, if the primary is over the secondary, there
must be high voltage insulation between them.  The peak output voltage when
the MOSFET turns off (the flyback pulse) may be more than 5 times
<i>higher</i> than what would be expected from the DC input voltage and
the turns-ratio alone - several kV and this *will* try to find a path to
ground!  There are more detailed transformer construction instructions in
the next section.
<p>
Note that this transformer is slightly larger physically than the one from
IC-HI1.  This is for two reasons: (1) It is easier to wind with more space
and a larger wire size for the secondary, and (2) continuous operation 
should be possible with 2 mW laser tubes, which might have been marginal
with the original transformer used in IC-HI1.  A byproduct of the larger
core is that its 9 turn primary should be roughly equivalent to the 12 turn
primary of the smaller core in terms of inductance and core saturation
limitations.
<p>
Interestingly, a similar transformer found in a different commercial
power supply, had no insulating tape anywhere.  It would appear that
with very precise machine-wound HV secondary, done first, the voltage
is distributed so uniformly that this is unnecessary.
<p>
I've now built and tested several transformers in IC-HI1, removing the
original transformer and installing socket pins so either the original
or an adapter board can be plugged in.  This setup is then equivalent to
SG-HM2 with the HVM2-1 HV Module.  The minimum input voltage values that
follow are when driving a 0.5 mW HeNe laser tube:

<p>
*The number of turns on the original (#1) is not really known exactly and
may be lower or higher by up to 25 percent based on the measured secondary
resistance (45 ohms) and estimated wire size (somewhere between #38 and #40.
(Even with the larger wire, the amount of bobbin area taken up by the wire
is less than 50 percent so it should fit even with many layers of insulating
tape.  The transformer is Epoxy impregnated and likely to be impossible to
disassemble into any form that can be analyzed!)
<p>
All of these transformers
will drive HeNe laser tubes of up to at least 2.5 mW using the equivalent of
the HVM2-1 HV Module which is part of IC-HI1.  Even with the 2.5 mW tube, the
minimum operating voltage was only about 0.5 V higher than for the 0.5 mW
tube.  There is a good chance they would drive even larger HeNe laser tubes
(though possibly at a slightly higher input voltage) but I don't dare try
using the existing HV circuitry as it might not survive for long.
I suspect that transformers #4, #5, and #6 would run on an
input voltage of less than 8 VDC but the salvaged cores I am using have
a larger air-gap than might be optimal and I don't have anything
to reduce it without heavy losses.  They attempt to start the tube at around
6 VDC but are unable to maintain it and flicker rapidly.  (#2 and #3, which
use the same style core, would also benefit somewhat.)
Operation using #1 and #5 is virtually identical, with the original running
at perhaps 0.5 VDC less input.  I expect they would be even more identical if
the air-gap on #5 were smaller, and #6 with its smaller air-gap does indeed
run at the lower input voltage.  I haven't actually confirmed that anything
blows up above the maximum voltages listed above, which were arbitrarily
chosen.  But I am guessing that bad things might happen at some point. :)
<p>
I have also constructed a transformer which will need to be used with
HVM2-5: 12/1200, P over S, on a 30x19 pot core.  I will also construct
a 9/900. S over P, on a 30x19 pot core (or on a 26x16 if I can find one).
Testing of these will have to await an HVM2-5 prototype.

<h4><A NAME="hscsg93">SG-HM2 Transformer Construction</A></h4>

Here are details on construction of the inverter transformer for SG-HM2.
With all parts and tools on hand, it takes about an hour start to finish.
Only a small portion of this time is in the actual winding (at least if a
coil winding machine is used).  Most of the time is spent in adding
the insulation tape and terminating the leads.  After constructing a few of
these, it does go quicker. :)
<p>
Step-by-step instructions are provided for the HVM2-1 transformer.  The
changes needed for HVM2-5 are summarized at the end of this section.
Some sort of coil winding machine is almost essential as #40 wire
is extremely thin and easy to break.  (Anything larger than #40 will not
fit on the bobbin.)  It doesn't have to be fancy.  Mine is
probably 50 years old of the type that is (used to be?) advertised in the
back of electronics magazines.  However, a couple of spindles - one that is
fixed or free to rotate for the wire supply and the other which can be turned
for the coil being wound - are really all that are needed.  Don't use any
sort of powered approach though (unless you have a *real* professional coil
winder!) as it is all too easy to break the wire if there is no tactile
feedback to detect snags.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Parts required for T101 of HVM2-1:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>18x11 mm (1811) ferrite pot core with a small air-gap (no more than
  0.005") or no air-gap, and a single section bobbin.  These are available
  from several manufacturers but surplus or salvaged cores may be easier to
  obtain.  Radio Shack used to have a "ferrite kit" which included a variety
  of sizes of cores (only 1 each though so you'd have to buy two kits and
  there were no bobbins!).  I doubt the kit still exists though.
<p>
 <li>Approximately 1.5 feet of #28 magnet wire for the primary (9 turns
  wound first) and approximately 60 feet of #40 magnet wire for the secondary
  (450 turns wound on top of the primary).  I found both these size wire in
  various solenoids and relays I've discombobulated. :)  Wire sizes aren't
  critical but these are known to fit and the #40 can be handled with a
  reasonable chance of not breaking.
<p>
 <li>Sleeving to protect the primary wires where they leave transformer.
  I used approximately 2" of insulation (each lead) from the individual
  wires in some 25 pair phone cable.
<p>
 <li>Wirewrap wire or other thin insulated wire to terminate the secondary
  wires where they leave the transformer.
<p>
 <li>Insulating tape.  1 mil Mylar or similar is desirable.  However, I've
  found that thin clear (non-reinforced) packing tape does an adequate job,
  though it probably doesn't have as much dielectric strength as real
  insulating tape so additional layers are required.  It will also likely
  not stand up to overheating too well.  Electrical tape is way too thick
  and would prevent enough turns from fitting.
<p>
 <li>A piece of Perf. board with holes on 0.1" centers, 0.8"x0.8".  There
  should be 7 rows of holes each way so that one hole lines up in the center.
<p>
 <li>A Nylon 4-40 screw and nut to fasten the transformer to the board.
<p>
 <li>Four (4) machined-type IC socket pins or something similar to use as
  terminals.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Wind the primary:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Slip a piece of sleeving over the start of the primary wire and position
  the sleeving so it extends about 1/2 turn inside the bobbin on the left side.
<p>
 <li>Wrap exactly 9 turns of this wire clockwise around the bobbin, left to
  right.  The wires should enter and exit on the same angular position (slot)
  of the bobbin on opposite sides.
<p>
 <li>Slip another piece of sleeving over the wire end exiting the bobbin so
  that it too is about 1/2 turn inside the bobbin.
<p>
 <li>Wrap 1.5 to 2 turns of tape tightly over the  primary winding to secure
   and insulate it.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Wind the secondary:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Strip 1/8" or so from the end of a 2" piece of wirewrap wire and solder
  the start of the wire for the secondary winding to it.  Make sure the
  insulation on the fine magnet wire has been removed - usually just heating
  it while soldering will do this.  Leave an inch or so of the magnet wire
  extending from the connection so that continuity can be confirmed with a
  multimeter, then snip it off.  Install this in the opposite slot of the
  bobbin also on the left side with about 1/4" of insulation inside the
  bobbin against the side and separated from the primary.  Leave a little
  slack in the fine secondary wire so that slight motion won't break it.
  Add a small piece of tape to protect and insulate this connection.
<p>
 <li>Using your coil winding machine (you do have one, correct?), build up
  the secondary in layers of about 50 to 75 turns in a counter-clockwise
  direction (bobbin being rotated clockwise).  A single layer of wire won't
  fit in the 1/8" or so available (in the 18x11 mm core bobbin) so there
  will have to be some overlap.  But, do this several times across
  the layer so that any given wire won't be next to one with a much different
  voltage.  In other words, wind a few turns and back up so that there will
  in essence be multiple sub-windings of 5 or 10 turns, repeated several
  times across the layer.  Keep the wire at least 1/32" away from either
  edge of the bobbin.
<p>
 <li>After each full layer or wire, add just over 1 layer of insulating tape
  making sure it covers the entire width of the bobbin.  There should be
  just enough overlap to assure there is at least 1 layer of insulation but
  not much more as excessive tape will end up taking up too much space.
<p>
  The entire 450 turn winding will then require 6 to 9 full layers.  Add
  another layer of insulating tape over the last winding layer leaving the
  wire end exposed.
<p>
 <li>Terminate the end of the secondary winding with another piece of
  thin wire by soldering as above.  Confirm continuity with a multimeter.
  For the 450 turn secondary, the resistance should be about 60 ohms.
  Add a piece of thicker sleeving over this at the HV end if  space is
  available.  Else, use some bits of tape to insulate the wirewrap
  wire lead from the core and exposed inner layers that it may come near
  as it exits out the side of the bobbin.  Add another layer of tape to
  secure the lead in place.
<p>
 <li>Add several more layers of insulating tape to complete the bobbin
  assembly.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Prepare the mounting board:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Widen the center hole to 7/64" to accommodate a 4-40 nylon screw.
<p>
 <li>Widen the holes at the 4 corners of the board to accept the 4 IC
  socket pins (if used) as a press-fit or glue them in place with 5 minute
  Epoxy or SuperGlue(tm).
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Final assembly:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Install the ferrite pot core halves to the bobbin taking care not to
  crunch any of the wires.  Orient it so that the primary and secondary leads
  are conveniently located with respect to the 4 pins, e.g., primary start:
  bottom left; primary end: top left, secondary start: bottom right; and
  primary end: top right.
<p>
 <li>Use the nylon 4-40 screw and nut to *gently* secure the transformer to the
  mounting board.  The head of the 4-40 screw should be underneath the board.
  Don't overtighten or it may crack the core, especially if it has an air-gap
  in the middle.
<p>
 <li>Carefully remove the insulation from the ends of the wires.  The
  secondary wires will still be fragile even with the wirewrap
  wire terminations.  For the magnet wire, the  easiest way to remove the
  insulation is to burn it off with a match or hot soldering iron and then
  clean with fine sandpaper.
<p>
 <li>Push the wires into their respective socket pins.  (The wirewrap wires
  are too thin to be secure but they will make adequate contact for testing.)
<p>
 <li>Use a multimeter to confirm continuity of the primary (close to 0
  ohms) and secondary (about 50 to 75 ohms).
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Testing:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Install the transformer in you HV Module.  Attach a HeNe laser tube
  and ballast resistor.
<p>
 <li>Power up on an variable DC power supply and check for reliable starting
  and stable operation.  Adjust the core gap if needed.  A smaller gap may
  result in more operating power available at a given input voltage.  A larger
  gap will result in attempts to  start on a lower input voltage.  Somewhere
  around 0.005" is probably a good compromise.
<p>
 <li>After testing the transformer (and adjusting the core gap if needed),
  use some adhesive to secure the pot core sections and to protect the
  transformer leads.  Solder the leads into the socket pins.
 </ul>
</ol>
<p>
The final result is shown on an adapter in: <A HREF="sghm2tp1.jpg">Photo of
SG-HM2 HVM2-1 Transformer being Tested in IC-HI1</A>.
<p>
The instructions for winding the HVM2-5 transformer are similar except for
the dimensions, wire sizes and lengths, and number of turns for the primary
and secondary:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Differences in parts list for T501 of HVM2-5 compared to T101 of HVM2-1:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>26x16 mm (2616) ferrite pot core with a small air-gap (no more than
  0.005") or no air-gap, and a single section bobbin.
<p>
 <li>Approximately 2.0 feet of #26 magnet wire for the primary (12 turns
  wound first) and approximately 75 to 120 feet of #40 magnet wire for the
  secondary (600 or 900 turns wound on top of the primary).
<p>
 <li>A piece of Perf. board with holes on 0.1" centers, 1.0"x1.0".  There
  should be 9 rows of holes each way so that one hole lines up in the center.
<p>
 <li>A Nylon 10-32 screw and nut to fasten the transformer to the board.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Since the peak voltage on the HVM2-5 secondary may be 2 to 3 times higher
than for HVM2-1, extra insulation and clearances will be required on the
secondary.

<h3>Kim's Flyback Based HeNe Laser Power Supply (KC-HI1)</h3>

This inverter was originally built to be the starter for the power supply
described in the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsckc1">Kim's Mid-Size HeNe
Power Supply</A>.  However, Kim found that with the addition of a HV capacitor
made out of aluminum foil and baggies!!!, it would drive a 1 mW HeNe tube
without any additional components.  I would recommend that you might want to
consider using a more substantial HV capacitor.  Perhaps, at least get some
name-brand baggies. :-)
<p>
Thus, for small HeNe tubes, this may be all you need.  And, you can always use
it as the starter when you find some larger ones.
<p>
Its wide compliance operation is quite similar to that of the circuit described
in the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg5">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser
Power Supply 2 (SG-HI2)</A> but is somewhat simpler and easier to construct.
I do not know how its maximum output power compares but it can be easily
scaled up if needed (larger flyback, larger driver transistor, and possibly a
beefier DC supply to power it).
<p>
This design uses the flyback from a mono computer monitor driven by an NPN
darlington power transistor that used to be a solenoid driver from a dead dot
matrix printer.  By using the high gain darlington rather than a regular
deflection or audio power transistor, a 556 timer IC can connect to its base
without any matching transformer or additional active components.
<p>
The flyback was modified by adding the drive winding on the exposed leg of the
core - 20 turns of #24 magnet wire on an insulating sleeve.  The high voltage
rectifier is built into the flyback.
<p>
Frequency and pulse width are adjustable with optimal values for the particular
implementation shown in ()s.  (See the calculations below.)
<p>
Estimated specifications (Kim-I1):
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage: 1,000 to 2,000 V.
<li>Operating current: 0 to 4 mA.
<li>Starting voltage: 5,000 to 10,000 V.
<li>Compliance range: NA - no regulator.
</ul>
The entire circuit fits on 1/3 of a Radio Shack experimenters PCB!

</PRE>
C4 and D1 need a voltage rating sufficient for the spike that results when
Q1 turns off.  Its magnitude will depend on the inductance of the flyback and
total capacitance (C4 + flyback).  The value of C4 is one thing that can be
changed to optimize performance but make sure to monitor the pulse across
Q1 (when it turns off) as you bring up the input voltage and adjust the
frequency and/or pulse width to avoid exceeding the transistor's Vce breakdown
rating.  D1 should be a high speed (fast recovery) type.
<p>
The only somewhat critical components are C5 and R10+R11 to set the operating
frequency, and C2 and R7+R8 to set the pulse width.
<p>
In this drawing, frequency is (Timer 1):
<PRE>
                   1.44                          1.44
  F = -------------------------------- = ------------------------ = 28.044 kHz
       ((R10 + R11 + (2 * R12).)* C5)     (14900 + 660) * 3.3E-9
</PRE>
and the pulse width is (Timer 2):
<PRE>
  T = (1.1 * (R7 + R8) * C2) = (1.1 * 8300 * 10<sup>-9</sup>) = 9.13 uS
</PRE>
Optimum frequency and pulse width will depend on the flyback transformer
actually used and your needs.  I assume the values in (), above, were chosen to
maximize output power).
<ul>
<li>For use as a wide compliance HeNe laser power supply, frequency and pulse
  width will need to be adjusted to obtain both the needed starting voltage
  and then the operating current.  This will probably mean running at 10 kHz
  or higher.  Pulse width will probably need to be set just below the point at
  which the flyback core saturates (if you have an oscilloscope, monitor Q1
  collector current by inserting a very small current sense resistor in the
  power supply return) with frequency set as high as possible still providing
  an adequate flyback period.
<p>
  A 12 V, 2 A power supply will likely be needed.
<p>
  S1 would be a toggle/slide switch or omitted entirely (pin 10 of U1 tied
  high).
<p>
<li>For use as a starter, all that matters is peak voltage - frequency is
  somewhat irrelevant and can be quite low.  Increase the pulse width until
  starting is reliable subject to the constraint that the flyback core doesn't
  saturate (see above).
<p>
  Since the circuit is fired up only rarely, average current requirements are
  quite low.  The +12 V power supply was salvaged from the same monitor as the
  flyback.  It uses a full wave bridge rectifier with a 3,300 uF filter
  capacitor and is adjustable from around 9.5 V to 13 V.  There are separate V+
  feeds from the power supply for the 556 and flyback.  There are a 100 uF
  electrolytic, 10 uF tantalum, and a .01 uF disk keeping the 556 happy.  A
  larger main filter capacitor or post filter capacitor may be desirable due to
  the pulsed nature of the load.
<p>
  The Start switch, S1, is a momentary pushbutton and enables the drive on
  demand.

I have now acquired an old oscilloscope and frequency counter.  They worked
wonders on fine tuning my HV inverter/starter circuit! I was very surprised how
easy it is to adjust the frequency and pulse width for maximum output from the
FBT. I wrapped 1 turn around the core and could easily adjust for maximum
output on the scope. The frequency ended up being just a little over 15 kHz. At
the time I originally constructed this power supply all I could do was use my
5 kV, 1 mA meter as a load when making adjustments and calculate what the
frequency was from what the values were supposed to be.  Now it works much
better!

<h3>Another Inverter Driven HeNe Power Supply 1 (AN-HI1)</h3>

This HeNe laser power supply might have been sold as a kit or perhaps only its
plans were included with a surplus tube or head sold by
<A HREF="http://www.sciplus.com/">American Science
and Surplus</A>.  It is a very basic inverter using
a 555 timer driving a flyback transformer in a wide compliance design similar
to SG-HI1 and SG-HI2.  The only thing interesting about it is that the 555
uses a nifty constant frequency variable duty cycle circuit for tube current
adjustment.  The flyback isn't specified but I would imagine that one from a
small B/W TV, computer monitor, or terminal should work.  However, unless the
original circuit used 12 V or so for the flyback, it may be necessary to
install a winding of your own of typically 12 to 24 turns somewhere on the
core.

<h3>Donna's Computer Controlled HeNe Laser Power Supply (DP-HI1)</h3>

I hadn't realized that PCs had become cheaper than 555 timers quite yet but
here is an example of using a computer to drive the inverter directly.
I suppose this could provide additional flexibility for optimization and
at the very least, must be unique. :)
<p>
(From: Donna Polehn (Donna.Polehn@Verizon.Net).)
<p>
I am sure others have thought of this, but nevertheless, here is a
PDF file of my little HeNe laser power supply.  I
used a spare computer as a signal generator to drive a flyback that
I basically modified based on <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg7">Sam's Inverter
Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 4 (SG-HI4)</A>.  I am using it to
drive a Melles Griot 1.2 mW HeNe laser tube.  It works great. :)
I wrote a little signal generator program that uses the sound
card of the computer to generate waveforms.  You can adjust the waveform
shape, duty cycle, and frequency.

OK, so maybe now that you have determined optimal operating parameters,
using a 555 timer might be desirable for portability if nothing else.
Carrying even a notebook PC along to control your HeNe laser power supply
could be a drag. :)

<h2>Other HeNe Laser Power Supply Circuits on the Web</h2>

There are a few other HeNe laser power supply circuits available on-line.
Here are some comments on them:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The HeNe laser power supply circuit found under <A HREF=
 "http://www.ee.washington.edu/circuit_archive/circuits/F_ASCII_Schem.html#ASCIISCHEM_007">Info on CO2 lasers wanted (ho hum)</A> (don't ask!) at the
  <A HREF="http://www.ee.washington.edu/circuit_archive/">University of
  Washington's Electrical Engineering Circuits Archive</A> is a 12 V switching
  supply, apparently identical to the design found in the book by Robert E.
  Iannini [3].  
<p>
  As expected, there is no information on the special ferrite transformer
  which they (the author of the book) expect you to obtain from Information
  Unlimited.  If it is still available, I expect the cost to be about $10.
<p>
  See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsit">Simple Inverter Type Power
  Supply for HeNe Laser</A> for details on a similar design that you can build
  if you are willing to wind your own transformer or use the flyback from a
  small B/W TV or monochrome computer monitor.
<p>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.aaroncake.net/circuits/lasersup.htm">LASER
  Power Supply</A> at
  <A HREF="http://www.aaroncake.net/circuits/">Aaron's Electronics
  Site</A> is *supposed* to run on 115 VAC but didn't have anything which
  looked like it would give the starting voltage and besides, used a 9 V
  transformer *backwards* to provide 1,600 V.  Yikes! and the words say a
  resistor passes 100 W!
<p>
  My guess is that this never worked (at least not for more than a few
  milliseconds) as it depends on putting 115 VAC into the 9 V winding of a
  little transformer.  These are not normally designed with any substantial
  margins.  It probably operates mostly in core saturation likely melting
  down or blowing up or both in short order.  Perhaps (generously) the author
  was mistaken about the transformer or (more likely) never actually built
  the thing at all.
<p>
  I include a reference to it here only to warn that I do not recommend this
  as a viable option.
<p>
<li>Another one to avoid at all costs is from
 <A HREF="http://www.primeline-america.com/science/">Tesla Coil Science Fair
 Project Plans</A>.  It is based on a Tesla coil using an automotive ignition
 coil to generate the high voltage.  It will almost certainly ruin the HeNe
 laser tube in a few minutes (or an hour or two at most) even though the laser
 will produce a beam for awhile.  The cause is at least in part due to damage
 to the mirror at the anode-end of the tube from overheating and sputtering.
 The output of the Tesla coil is pulsed AC (no rectification) and there is no
 way to control current to the tube.  It's also possible for the excessively
 high voltage to puncture the glass destroying the tube instantly.  Assuming
 this doesn't happen, the output may start out bright but will gradually
 decrease in intensity until there is no beam at all. With care, this device
 can be used for brief testing at most.
<p>
<li>The
 <A HREF="http://www.eed.usv.ro/misc/mirrors/cc/circuit.htm/0175.htm">Laser
 Power Supply & Starting Circuit</A> at
 <A HREF="http://www.eed.usv.ro/misc/mirrors/cc/index2.htm/">Circuit
 Central</A> is correct in spirit but has
 a number of typo-type errors - can you find them?  Hint: A capacitor is
 missing and there is a built in short circuit.  However, they seem to
 want to use very high values of ballast resistance to control HeNe tube
 current - which are of insufficient wattage for tube currents greater than
 about 4 mA. And, the actual transformer selected (they suggest a range from
 650 to 1,000 VRMS for the secondary) will limit how large a HeNe tube can be
 used (more so than is suggested by the comments on the circuit diagram).
<p>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.jemelec.com/ftp/laserpsu.zip">2 - 10
 mW Helium-Neon Laser PSU (8 kVDC)</A> at the
 <A HREF="http://www.jemelec.com/download.htm">JEM Electronics
 Download Page</A> is an AC line powered design using a 650 VRMS, 25 VA 
 power transformer and 9 stage voltage multiplier - that's it!  Tube current
 is adjusted by the value of the ballast resistance.  I have my
 doubts about it driving an HeNe tube of more than 2 or 3 mW.  The schematic
 (and all others at this site) are drawn using a non-standard drafting
 package, "Draft Choice for Windows".  An evaluation copy is available
 for download from their site.
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.oatleyelectronics.com/">Oatley Electronics</A> used to
 offer a HeNe laser power supply kit.  It is apparently discontinued from
 their supplier and not too many are remaining and the link they used to
 have to the schematic has died.  It looks like a nice design using an SG3525
 PWM controller to provide current regulation.  I have a local copy at
