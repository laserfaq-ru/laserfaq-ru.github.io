<h2>Introduction</h2>

This chapter deals with HeNe lasers that have their frequency actively
regulated either directly, or indirectly via control of intensity.  Their
output is generally either a Single Longitudinal Mode (SLM), or pair of
adjacent longitudinal modes or a pair of optical frequencies close together.
Unstabilized HeNe lasers - the more conventional type that most people are
familiar with - are covered in the chapter:
<A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hcltoc">Commercial HeNe Lasers</A>.
<p>
For current production lasers, the manufacturers' Web sites often provide
basic specifications.  For older lasers, it's often difficult to obtain
detailed specs so estimates based on physical size, and then testing may
be the only option.
<p>
The sections in this chapter are arranged approximately in alphabetical
order by manufacturer.

<h4><A NAME="hstcst">Comparison Chart of Commercial Stabilized HeNe
 Lasers</A></h4>

Here is a summary of the frequency stability specifications for most of
the stabilized HeNe lasers that are presently commercially available,
or have been in the past.  The best of the mode-stabilized lasers
approaches the performance of a much more complex and expensive
iodine-stabilied HeNe laser (also included in this chart).
<p>
Unless otherwise noted (below), these data were
obtained from brochures, spec sheets, or user manuals for each laser.
Contributions and corrections welcome.
<p>
All values are in parts per billion (ppb).

<p>
The * denotes lasers that are covered in detail elsewhere in this chapter.
<p>
<b>Type Legend:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>SM - Single Mode stabilization with single mode output.  A single
 polarized mode is used for feedback.  Only a single mode exits the laser.
<p>
<li>DM - Dual Mode stabilization.  Two orthogonal polarized modes are used
 for feedback.  With the scientific lasers, only a single mode exits the
 laser but with some, it's possible to remove a polarizer to have both modes.
 (The metrology lasers output both modes.)  Lasers like the Melles
 Griot 05-STP-901 and SP-117/A/C that can be either frequency or intensity
 stabilized use a single mode for feedback when intensity stabilized.
<p>
<li>TM - Three Mode stabilization.  This laser uses second order difference
 frequencies with 3 modes present and a PLL for stabilization.
<p>
<li>LD - Lamp Dip stabilization.  This laser uses the Lamb Dip in a special
 short laser tube for stabilization and  outputs a single polarized mode
 at the center of the neon gain curve.
<p>
<li>GP - Gain Peak stabilization.  This laser uses the peak of the neon
 gain curve for stabilization.  The output is a single polarized mode.
<p>
<li>AZ - Axial Zeeman.  An axial magnetic field splits the neon gain curve
 to produce a pair of optical frequencies usually separated by a few MHz
 use dual mode stabilization.  I am aware of one exception - the Optra
 Optralite Two-Frequency HeNe Laser - where stabilization uses a
 Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with the split frequency set to only 250 kHz.
 The output in all cases is a pair of orthogonal linearly polarized
 components at the two optical frequencies (F1 and F2).
<p>
<li>TZ - Transverse Zeeman. A transverse magnetic field splits the neon gain
 curve to produce a pair of optical frequencies a few hundred kHz apart.
 These may use dual mode or PLL stabilization with one or both linearly
 modes exiting the laser.
<p>
<li>I2 - Iodine Stabilized.
</ul>
<p>
<b>AP (Application) Legend:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>M - Metrology - precision measurement of displacement, velocity, angle,
 straightness, and more, using interferometry.  These lasers are generally
 a component of an entire system consisting of optics, processing electronics,
 and analysis software.
<p>
<li>S - Scientific.  The laser may be used as a wavelength/frequency
 reference, for general interferometry, and for other specialized applications
 requiring a known and/or fixed low power monochromatic source.
</ul>
<p>
A metrology laser can generally also be used for scientific/research
applications since all have very tightly controlled optical frequency.
And while the converse is often (but not always) true in principle, it's
not usually practical or worthwhile except
for experimental purposes since metrology systems may require laser
characteristics (like two-frequency) that aren't present in laboratory
stabilized lasers.  In addition, the optics and cabling/electronics
requirements would likely make their adaptation potentially complex, if
possible at all.
<p>
<b>Notes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Whether "+/-" is used for the ppb value depends on how they were listed
 in the spec sheet, research paper, or other source.
<p>
<li>The Melles Griot 05-STP-91X and Aerotech S100, on which it is based,
 are assumed to have the same specifications.
<p>
<li>Specifications for the Laseangle RB-1 were obtained from the
 paper: "Frequency stability measurements on polarization-stabilized
 He-Ne lasers", T. M. Niebauer, James E. Faller, H. M. Godwin, John L. Hall,
 and R. L. Barger, Applied Optics, vol. 27, no. 7, 1 April 1988, pp. 1285-1289.
<p>
<li>The Melles Griot 05-STP-901 and Spectra-Physics 117A, which is
 nearly identical, are assumed to have the same specifications.
<p>
<li>While the original Spectra-Physics 117 laser uses essentially the same
 laser head as the 117A, its electronics differ so the specifications may
 not be the same.  However, the OEM Spectra-Physics 117C probably has
 specifications similar to the 117A if installed in a suitable enclosure.
<p>
<li>The Mark-Tech 7910 seems to be the same laser as the 7900 but with the
 addition of an internal optical receiver.  So, the laser probably has the
 same specifications.
<p>
<li>The SP-119 with the Servo Option had a stability specification
 of +/-10 ppb per day in a 1964 brochure (which probably predated the
 actual laser!).  But this was improved to +/-2 ppb in the 1966 Operator
 Manual.  The SP-119 without the Servo Option has a stability specification
 of +/-75 ppb per day using a constant temperature controller without
 optical feedback.
<p>
<li>The Teletrac/Axsys 150 lasers may output either a single circularly
 polarized mode or a single linearly polarized mode oriented at 45 degrees
 depending on model/version.
<p>
<li>The Zygo 7701/01/12/14/22/24 use an AOM to split the output into two
 frequency components 20 MHz apart.  The Zygo 7705 is a Zeeman-split
 two-frequency HeNe laser similar in performance to an HP/Agilent 5517D.

The Syncrolase 100 is an amplitude stabilized HeNe laser that combines the
laser tube and locking circuitry into a single compact unit with only DC
and/or HV power applied externally.  Everything related to stabilization
is contained in a small module that screws onto the end of a substantially
standard 1 or 2 mW HeNe laser head.  Included are the polarizing optics and
beam sampler, a single photodiode, and all the feedback control circuitry.
<p>
With only a single photodiode sampling the beam, only the amplitude of
one of the two polarized modes can be stabilized.  However, the frequency
stability will still be quite good once the laser tube has reached
thermal equilibrium and its power has leveled off.  However, why
frequency stabilization was not also implemented is a mystery as it would
have been a very straightforward enhancement - a second photodiode and
difference amp!
<p>
Lasers based on the Aerotech technology are now sold as the Melles Griot
05-STP-909 and 05-STP-911 (0.5 and 1.0 mW minimum output power, respectively).
The Melles Griot lasers are physically and functionally very similar to
the Syncrolase 100 but it is not known whether the electronics is as well.
However, all indications are that very little has been changed since
acquiring the technology from Aerotech when they took over the company.
Melles Griot calls them frequency stabilized lasers though their
description seems to indicate that the same amplitude
stabilization technique as the Syncrolase is used.  And, if you'd like to
order a few, the Melles Griot price (in 2009) is about $3,600 each! :)
Searching for "Melles Griot 05-STP-909" should return a spec sheet.  Here

<li>Power Stability (1 min./1 hr/8hrs): +/-0.2%.
<li>Frequency Tunability (Blue side): 100-600 MHz.
<li>Temperature Dependence: 0.5 MHz/&deg;C.

<li>Input Voltage: 100, 115, 230, or 240 Vac, +/-10%.
<li>Input Frequency: 50-60 Hz.
</ul>
<p>
In addition to output power, the Syncrolase came in two versions
based on whether a pair of DC wall adapters were used to power an
internal HeNe laser power supply and the locking controller, or whether
the laser head had a standard Alden connector to attach to an external
lab-style HeNe laser power supply.  (Melles Griot has since discontinued
the dual DC adapter versions.)
<p>
One of the unique features of this system is that rather than using a
resistance heater over a substantial part of the HeNe laser tube
as is done in most commercial stabilized HeNe lasers,
it uses a coil surrounding the OC mirror mount stem to
directly heat the metal mount via RF induction.  A very simple MOSFET driver
can provide over 10 W directly to the mount resulting in a very rapid
response.  Based on tests I've done, I estimate that at maximum RF power, it
will increase the temperature of the mirror mount stem itself
by greater than 1 &deg;C per <i>second</i>.  This is
more than an order of magnitude faster than traditional resistance heaters
surrounding the glass portion of the tube.  A thermocouple in close proximity
to the mirror mount stem senses its temperature and is used both to switch
the feedback loop on when hot enough, as well as to shut the heater off
if the temperature goes too high.  Warmup to fully stable operation
still takes 30 minutes or so because the rest of the laser has to come into
thermal equilibrium as well as the mirror mount stem.  But, initial locking
is very quick - a couple of minutes - and once locked, it should use less
power and be more immune to
ambient temperature variations, and the faster response
also improves frequency stability.  In addition, the use of this technique
allows for the possibility at least in principle of converting almost any
HeNe laser tube with a suitable mode structure into a stabilized laser by
simply attaching the very compact controller to its output end.  However,
in practice, minor details like the mirror mount stem dimensions and the
exhaust tip-off usually being in they way make this rather difficult.
<p>
The DC adapter (either version, 1 or 2 required depending on the model
of the laser) is rated 13 VDC, 1.3 A.  Measurements show it to have an
open circuit output of 16.5 V.  The plug is 2.5 mm center positive.  I
do not know the official specifications for the the external HeNe laser
power supply  (where required), but based on the length of the tube and
other typical Aerotech tubes, it probably around 1,500 V ad 5 mA.  Since
there is a 7812 +12 V regulator in the controller (see
the schematic below), the output of that DC adapter must be greater
than about 14.5 V to assure proper regulation.  So, at least once
the feedback loop is closed, the input voltage should never dip below 14.5 V.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube in the Syncrolase 100 is about 7 inches long.  A
common 6 to 9 inch tube with cathode-end output (high voltage far away
from the electronics!) would probably work except that the mirror mount
stem needs to be a about an inch long with the exhaust tip-off cut off
close to the end-cap so as not to interfere with the coupling coil
assembly.  Very few tubes have these characteristics, though some are
close enough to be usable in a pinch.  In addition, using too long a
tube might result in a second longitudinal mode being present if the
Output Adjustment is set so the main lasing line is too close to the
neon gain center.
<p>
The gate of a power MOSFET is driven by a simple oscillator, running at
between 500 kHz and 1 MHz (I measured about 700 kHz on one unit).
The feedback signal is summed into the gate junction from the error
amp and serves to modulate the output of the induction heater to
maintain lock once the operating temperature has been reached.
The coil is just short of 9 turns of #24 AWG wire close wound
on a 1.35 cm form.  Due to the way the leads enter through the
back of the form, the final turn is short changed! :)  This is
probably not terribly critical though.
<p>

A schematic diagram of the electronics for the Syncrolase 100 can be found at
<A HREF="atsl1sch.pdf">Schematic of Aerotech Syncrolase 100 Controller</A>.
This may not yet be quite complete and numerous errors are possible since the
PCB is tight, it is a 4 layer board, and the soldermask is almost totally
opaque.  It was not much fun to trace the circuit.
Part numbers are not available for a half dozen components because (1) they
might have been obscured and (2) there were several added parts that
appear to be in the "oops" category. :-)  But I bet this schematic provides
infinitely more information than what's available anywhere else! :)
<p>
The RF driver consists of a HEX Schmitt trigger (MC14584BCP similar to
a CMOS 40106) with one section used as the oscillator and the remaining
sections paralleled to buffer its output.  An RC network converts
the squarewave of the oscillator to a roughly triangle waveshape at the
MOSFET gate.  The output of the Error Integrator feeds into the gate
as well with the effect of modifying its DC offset.  Since the MOSFET
gate threshold is fixed, this produces a modulation effect which is a
combination of amplitude and pulse width, with the net result of
controlling the amount of RF power transferred
to the HeNe laser tube mirror mount stem.   A significant part of the
capacitance in the waveshaping network is the internal input capacitance
of the MOSFET gate itself, and this may exceed 1 nF.
Thus, it's possible that if the MOSFET needs to be replaced, the value of the
capacitor between the gate and ground (C13) may need to be adjusted
as well to maintain approximately the same net capacitance and waveshape.
The MOSFET gate capacitance can vary by a factor
of over 2:1 between MOSFETs with the same part number, or by even more
if a MOSFET with otherwise acceptable specifications is substituted.
On the unit I have, it was about 1.3 nF.
<p>
Newer versions include a ULN2003 Darlington array for something.  But I
haven't dug deep enough to be sure if it's part of the MOSFET driving
circuitry or replaces the MOSFET entirely.  They may also use a
semiconductor sensor in place of the thermocouple - it looks like
a 1N4148 with no markings.  That's probably much cheaper!
<p>
The control functions are implemented in the four sections of a TLC27L4CN
quad op-amp as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Temperature Amp (A1A):</b> The temperature of the mirror mount stem
 as sensed by a thermocouple is converted to a voltage between 0 and 3 or 4 V
 (the temperature limit).  At an output voltage of slightly over +VREF (2.5 V),
 the feedback loop is enabled via A1C, configured as a comparator.
<p>
 The output of A1A also feeds the Over-Temperature protection circuit that
 is supposed to turn the heater off if the temperature goes too high.
 However, on early units, this almost looks like an afterthough with its
 adjustment pot hanging in mid-air!
<p>
<li><b>Photodiode Amp (A1B):</b> The intensity of the P mode is converted to a
 voltage between 0 and 10 V.  This amplifier is always active except that
 its output (following a current limiting resistor) is clamped low until
 the operating temperature is reached.
<p>
<li><b>Sync Enable Comparator (A1C):</b> When the output of A1A exceeds
 +VREF, the locking feedback loop is enabled by unclamping the output of
 A1A.  This also turns on the Sync LED.  The hysteresis provided by the
 positive feedback resistor assures that normal variations in temperature
 to maintain lock will not disable the feedback loop.
<p>
<li><b>Error Integrator (A1D):</b> The difference between the intensity set
 point for the P mode and the output of A1B is integrated (actually a PI
 configuration) and used to modulate the output power of the RF driver by
 varying the DC level of its triangle wave gate signal.
</ul>
<p>
When powered up, the temperature sensor is initially cool so the RF
driver comes on at full power.  When the mirror mount stem reaches the
operating temperature (something like 80 &deg;C in 30 seconds or so),
the feedback loop becomes active and the Sync LED comes on.  However,
since the remainder of the laser tube is still increasing in temperature
due to the normal heating of the discharge and hasn't reached thermal 
equilibrium, lock may be lost several times as the overall tube expands and
the controller then needs to keep *reducing* the temperature of the mirror
mount stem to maintain the distance between the mirrors constant.
When the mirror mount temperature gets to be too
low, the system will go back to continuous heating based on the hysteresis
of the Sync Enable Comparator.  After a half hour or so, the laser tube
will reach thermal equilibrium and the system will then remain locked
forever.  (Unfortunately, many people take this literally and leave the
laser on until it dies, which is considerably sooner than forever!)
<p>
Here are some photos:

<li><A HREF="atsl1p1.jpg">Photo of Aerotech Syncrolase 100 With External HeNe
 Laser Power Supply</A>.  For this version, the laser tube is typically
 powered by a standard Lab-Style HeNe laser power supply and the Syncrolase
 controller is powered by a DC wall adapter.  The particular laser head
 in the photo was actually one I found in my "unidentified laser head
 box", probably having originated in an Aerotech dumpster. :)  Thus,
 there are no labels on it.
<p>
<li><A HREF="atsl1p2.jpg">Photo Showing Components of Aerotech Syncrolase 100

 identical DC wall adapters.  The cylindrical HeNe laser power supply,
 7" HeNe laser tube, and controller are on the bottom, with their covers
 and hardware.  This is basically everything there is in the Syncrolase
 except for the ballast resistor (which may be part of the HeNe laser power
 supply or a rubber-encased ring of resistors that fits over the tube's
 anode-end mirror mount stem), a few screws, and the DC wall adapters.
 Aside from how the laser tube is powered, everything else is identical
 to the other version.

<p>
<li><A HREF="atsl1hp1.jpg">Closeup of Induction Heating Coil of Aerotech
 Syncrolase 100</A>.  This coil consists of just short of 9 turns of #24 AWG
 magnet wire on a plastic form about 13.5 mm in diameter.  But nothing
 is terribly critical.  This newer controller uses a semiconductor
 temperature sensor visible inside the coil near the bottom.  It looks
 like a 1N4148 but may be something more exotic.
</ul>
<p>
The coupling coil assembly on the first Syncrolase 100 of mine had
disintegrated due to excessive temperature.  (Actually the magnet
wire and its insulation is in fine shape but the plastic form on
which the coil was wound or embedded is no more and it's not even
possible to determine much about it.)  I've tested the induction
heating winding a test coil on a tube made from insulating plastic
sheet.  The effect is impressive considering the simplicity of the
circuitry (see the schematic below) raising the
temperature of a dummy mirror mount stem by more than 1 &deg;C per second
even with a coil that is probably far from optimal.
<p>
I do not know for sure if the cause of the destroyed coil form was due
to a part failure rather than simply a result of the laser being been
left on for 7 years continuously! :)  The HeNe laser power supply was
indeed dead, probably due to the tube being very hard to start and
impossible to run for more than a few seconds regardless of power supply
or ballast resistance.  So it's possible that when the tube decided it
was tired of doing its thing and the power supply shorted out, the controller
ended up cycling on the over-temperature condition.  The Melles Griot
manual does warn against running without the laser on.  And, electrical
tests seem to indicate that the controller is working properly.
<p>
So, the Over-Temperature (OT) adjustment might have been incorrect and too
high all along.  Since it's not something that affects normal behavior, it
would be all too easy to neglect setting it properly!
I've also been told by the former owner that this laser always ran very
hot.  If the tube fails - even if someone forgets to plug in its wall
adapter! - the heater tends to be on and bad things can then
happen if the OT setting is too high.  Ask me how I found out. :( :)
OK, I'll tell you.  I acquired another Syncrolase with a good tube
but that would not stabilize.  I traced the problem to what I believe
may have been a short in the temperature sensor and then adjusted it
to operate at a reasonable temperature set-point.  But I accidentally
left the controller powered after turning off the laser and went away.
When I returned (after lunch!), the entire assembly was too hot to
touch and the platic coil form at is cover had melted!!!  Apparently,
either the OT setting was way too high (it's possible someone
before me messed with it) or it isn't effective or was broken.
<p>
Interestingly, on one of those rare occasions where I was able to get
the tube to remain on long enough with a lab power supply to watch a few
mode sweep cycles, it is a classic FLIPPER!  I suppose that
the flipperitis could have happened in its old age (it is also weak - about
0.7 mW - and with brown crud in the bore), but normally the flipper
or non-flipper status of a tube doesn't change over the course of its life.
I do have another Aerotech laser head that would screw right on to the
controller but it too is a flipper! :( :)  In fact, its behavior shown in
<A HREF="oem1rfm2.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
During First Part of Warmup</A> and the merged version in
<A HREF="oem1rfm3.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
During First Part of Warmup (Combined)</A> looks virtually identical
to that of the Syncrolase tube (over the few mode sweep cycles I could see
before the tube went out).  But, even more interstingly,
the flipping of the tube in the plots ceases entirely and it becomes
perfectly well behaved once nearly warmed up as shown in
<A HREF="oem1rfm4.gif">Plot of "Flipper" Aerotech OEM1R HeNe Laser Head
at Transition to Normal Behavior (Combined)</A>.
Perhaps that tube was intended for a
Syncrolase as it in unusual in having the required long mirror mount
stem and short cutoff exhaust pipe.  Perhaps it was a reject due to
the flipping.  Or perhaps for unknown reasons, all these tubes flip when cold.
Since the Syncrolase 100 would be operating well beyond this
point, there's a chance that the flipping is irrelevant and it
would work just fine.  In fact, that one working genuine Syncrolase
tube is also a flipper until it warmed up!  More on this below.
<p>
I built a replacement coil using the wire from the first dead Syncrolase
on a roll of plastic.  It works, though the temperature response
is faster probably because the thermocouple is not in the same location
as the original.  So, it locks more quickly, but also loses lock more
frequently during warmup but is otherwise functional.  Perhaps changing
the temperature set-point would correct that.  It's amazing how much
variability can be tolerated with this design.
<p>
Adjusting the temperature set-point is an interesting exercise.  Ideally,
it should be slightly above the equilibrium temperature of the laser head
with only the laser tube powered.  Set too high and the laser will run
excessively hot, but there will be a fewer number of lost lock events
during warmup.  Set too low and it may lose lock eventually when the
tube equilibrium temperature exceeds the set-point temperature.
<p>
One way to do the adjustment might be to initially
set the Temp. Gain pot (R1) fully CW (for a very low temperature) and
power *only* the laser head (not the controller) for at least an hour so it
reaches thermal equilibrium.  Then, power up the controller and slowly
turn R1 CCW to slightly beyond the point where the SYNC LED goes out.
Monitoring the Temperature Amp output (A1 pin 1) will indicate how effective
this is.  The voltage on A1 pin 1 should remain between approximately 1.5 V
and 2.75 V when the laser is locked.  If it goes below about 1.5 V, the
feedback loop is disabled and the heater turns on full (SYNC LED OFF).  This
state continues until the temperature increases to the point where A1 pin 1
exceeds about 2.75 V and the feedback loop is enabled (SYNC LED ON).
Better to start out with the temperature set-point adjusted too low
should the over-temperature protection fail. :( :)
<p>
I built another temporary coil for the first laser to check it out.  This
coil is wound on a plastic cylinder found in a junk pile that was glued
to the remains of the original coil form.  The Epoxy seems to stick
rather well, which is a bit surprising.  I didn't have any #24 AWG
magnet wire, so I used #20, which just fits 9 turns in the available
space.  The laser works quite well now except that the speed of heating
is not quite as fast, possibly due to the coil being slightly longer
and larger in diameter.  However, this is probably of little consequence
in the grand scheme of the Universe. :)  Lowering the RF frequency
improved the response, though there was no resonance.
<p>
Finally, I built a new coil form for the third laser.  It has approximately
the same dimensions as the original so it behaves very well.  But the
plastic is too think and there is very little clearance between the form
and mirror mount stem.  So the genuine Syncrolase laser head won't fit
because its tube is too off-center.  (This must have been a result of
the way it was manufactured since its beam is well centered.)  But my
"flipper" head fits just fine and works just fine. :)
<p>

<h3><A NAME="hstatsl11">Improving Over-Temperature Protection of the Syncrolase</A></h3>

Of three similar Syncrolase 100s I've seen, 1 had already melted, 1 I melted,
and the other is still fine. :)  There are several fundamental deficiencies
in the design that can lead to fireworks.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Single temperature sensor:</b> The same thermocouple (or possibly
 diode or other semiconductor sensor in later versions since it looks like
 a 1N4148) is used for both the operating point
 determination AND for over-temperature sensing.  If it fails open, then
 there is no limit to how hot the thing will get.  OK, well there is a limit -
 at the point when it catches fire and sets off the sprinkler system! :)
<p>
 I would suggest adding a separate temperature sensor used only for
 protection.  The circuit could be as simple as a 10K NTC thermistor and
 fixed resistor or rheostat in a voltage divider, a zener diode and
 a 2N3904 or similar transistor in parallel with the one in the existing OT
 circuit.  When the transistor turns on due to the resistance of the
 thermistor decreasing, it would shut down the heater
 drive.  These parts would easily fit in the available space.  There's
 even a spare hole in the coil form for an additional temperature
 sensor (at least in the ones I've seen).  Since it's only for OT,
 the sensor can be further from the coil.
<p>
<li><b>Lack of optical signal results in runaway heating:</b> With no laser
 output or insufficient output (as when the tube ages and its power declines
 to the point where the resulting voltage is less than the Output Level
 Adjust set-point), the error amp turns on the heater and keeps it on.
<p>
 Interchanging the Output Adjust and Photodiode inputs to the Error
 Integrator (A1D) would cause the heater to turn off with no or low
 optical power.  The only difference in functionality is that the laser
 would lock on the opposite side of the neon gain curve, equivalent to
 selecting the orthogonal polarization to the photodiode (by rotating
 the laser head 90 degrees).
<p>
 Adding a second photodiode for dual polarization stabilization would
 also be beneficial since the relative intensity of the two modes would
 be the relevant variable, not the absolute intensity of a single
 mode.  This ratio would still be valid at very low total output power.
<p>
<li><b>Separate power supplies for laser and controller:</b> The original
 designers may have considered this an advantage, but using a single
 power supply and setting up the cabling so the entire system is
 automatically powered would seem to be a desirable modification.
<p>
<li><b>Coil form material:</b> At least, if the thing does overheat,
 make the structure out of something that won't melt as easily.
 Even when the thing catches fire due to over-heating, the electronics
 seems to survive just fine, thank you.  So, why should a 10 cent
 plastic piece be the limiting factor! :)
</ul>
<p>
Another modification (or complete redesign depending on your point of view!)
that would enable the Syncrolase (or any thermally-stabilized laser) to
run at the minimum temperature to assure reliable operation would to
have a temperature set-point that is based on the ambient temperature
of the environment, not a fixed setting.  In principle, this can easily
be accomplished by counting mode cycles from a cold start.  Since each
mode cycle represents a precise change in temperature, this would enable
the laser to operate at a temperature of ambient plus a constant known
to be greater than the heating from the laser tube current.  A microcontroller
could be used for the implementation, left as an exercise for the student. :)
<p>
This of course assumes that the ambient temperature remains relatively
constant, but this is often the case with real lab environments.  The
Zygo metrology lasers with digital controllers compute the number of
mode cycles (they call them "mode slews) needed to reach operating
temperature based on the actual tube temperature when the laser is
switched on, though they may still operate at the temperature required
for worst case conditions.
<p>
While the Melles Griot 05-STP-9XX is not supposed to melt down due to a
fault condition like not powering the laser, it is not known if the design
has actually been improved or rather that they are simply depending careful
adjustment of the over temperature pot.

<h3><A NAME="hstatsl12">Using the Syncrolase Controller with Other HeNe Lasers</A></h3>

I acquired a second Syncrolase 100 on eBay which also had a dead tube,
but with a fully intact controller module.  So, I tried experiments with
two random polarized HeNe laser tubes.  These were selected mainly to be
cathode output and to have enough OC mirror stem accessible for coupling
to the induction heater coil.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Melles Griot 05-LHR-038 HeNe laser tube:</b> This one puts out over
 3 mW so it is somewhat higher power than the original.  Only about 1/2 inch
 of bare  mirror mount stem was accessible so the coupling may not have been
 ideal.  I simply set the tube up on V-blocks with the Syncrolase controller
 carefully positioned so the beam was centered, and aligned the tube
 so one of its polarization axes matched the
 arrow on the controller.  Watching the mode sweep on a plotting laser
 power meter showed the rapid induction heating process.  After
 a couple of minutes, the "Locked" LED came on green and a bit after
 that, the output stabilized at about 1 mW.  The "Output Adjust" trim-pot
 on the Syncrolase controller allows the exact position on the HeNe
 gain curve to be selected, though it didn't have enough range to go
 higher than about 1.3 mW (the maximum was over 1.7 mW for this tube).
<p>
<li><b>Aerotech OEM1R Laser Head:</b> I actually don't know the model
 number for this laser head as it had no label when I acquired, source
 unknown, but it is the same size as an OEM1R.
 Whether intended for a Syncrolase or not, the laser head cylinder
 has the same mating threads, normally filled by its end-cap.  The
 OC mirror mount stem is nice and long as are most on Aerotech tubes,
 but the tip-off is fairly short.  The latter feature
 is suspicious, as nearly all the other Aerotech lasers I've seen have
 long tip-offs which would get in the way of the induction heater
 coil.  And, like the tube removed from the other dead Syncrolase,
 this head is also a flipper that I had tested a long time ago!
 But they can't require tubes to be flippers, could they? :)
 Nonetheless, it had no trouble stabilizing.  I watched every last mode
 sweep and every one flipped.  So, it probably worked because I was lucky
 today and the flipping occurred on the opposite slope of the
 mode sweep from that which is used for locking.  But of course, rotating
 the controller module 90 degrees with respect to the laser head
 would reverse the slope if needed.  With this tube probably being
 almost identical to the one intended for use with the Syncrolase, the
 output adjustment covered the entire useful range of the mode position.
 A setting of about 0.75 mW seemed like a good place to park it. :)
 This rig would be equivalent to the Melles Griot 05-STP-909.
</ul>
<p>
So, while two data points may not be conclusive, it would seem that
that almost any tube that can be stabilized using the conventional
heating blanket technique can also be stabilized using the Syncrolase
controller if its mirror mount stem will fit inside and extend far enough
into the induction heater coil.  Where the tip-off is not too long
but interferes with the coil assembly, simply removing the plastic
cover may gain enough clearance.  Of course, if you happen to be
friendly with the tip-off person at a HeNe laser tube manufacturer,
simply ask them to pinch-off and trim the tip-off closer to the tube! :)
For longer higher power tubes, the internal
preamp gain would need to be reduced to allow the Output Adjust pot to
lock at higher power.  Of course, for such tubes, the position
on the gain curve over which the output is pure single mode would
be reduced.
<p>
And flippers will work just fine, thank you. :-)  And as noted above, 3 of 3
Aerotech tubes from Syncrolase lasers were flippers, at least when cold!

<h3><A NAME="hstatsl13">Adding True Frequency Stabilized Mode to the Syncrolase</A></h3>

While Melles Griot describes the 05-STP-909/910/911/912 as a frequency
stabilized HeNe laser, it really is not since only a single photodiode
is used for optical feedback.  However, in principle, it would be very
straightforward to convert this laser or the Syncrolase to use dual mode
stabilization.  The electronics would be trivial: If an amplitude
stabilized mode is no longer desired, then it's just a matter of adding
a second photodiode in parallel with the first one, with the opposite
polarity.  Otherwise, an additional op-amp for the second photodiode
would be needed to feed the Error Integrator with a switch to enable it.
<p>
The real challenge would be to find space for the modified photodiode
assembly.  One option would be to replace the polarizing beam-splitter
cube with a 45 degree 5 percent plate beam-splitter.  Then, mount a
5 mm diameter PBS above this with the photodiodes attached to it.
As far as the additional electronics. the newer versions of the
Syncrolase, and presumably the 05-STP-909/910/911/912 as well have
less space available, but there's probably still enough space to
float an IC above the other components. :)  Or, if everything were

<h2>Coherent Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A>
<h3><A NAME="hstco200">Coherent Model 200 Single Frequency Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The CO-200 is a HeNe laser that operates in a single longitudinal mode.  It
consists of a cylindrical laser head and separate controller/power supply
as shown in <A HREF="co200p1.jpg">Coherent Model 200 Stabilized HeNe Laser</A>.
The only front panel control is the power switch on the left.  The only
indicator is a red "Wait"/green "Ready" lamp on the right.
Although the CO-200 design dates from the early to mid-1980s, I've seen
systems with post-2000 manufacturing dates, likely for some OEM customer,
possibly used in a high accuracy wavemeter as the reference laser.
<p>
The HeNe laser head is powered from a standard Laser Drive 6.5 mA, 2,100 V
power supply brick via a HV BNC connector.  There is no special control or
regulation of this supply - it's turned on by the main power switch.
But some thoughtful engineer included a high resistance bleeder to
discharge the HV caps in the power supply brick after power is removed. :)
<p>
The HeNe laser tube itself is a Melles Griot (not made by
Coherent!) model, labeled 05-LHR-219-158.  It has similar dimemsions
to an 05-LHR-120, a common 2 mW (rated) random polarized laser.
But, the -158 may mean it has been specially selected to have a well
behaved mode sweep cycle (not a flipper!) for this application.
It may also be filled with isotopically pure gases and an AR-coated HR
(to minimize back-reflections from the HR's outer surface).
The tube itself puts out more than 2 mW when new - possibly up to 4 mW
or even more - but the polarizing and beam
sampling optics sucks up some of it.  In addition, depending on the particular
version, there is either a dielectric filter or polarizing filter in the
end-cap.  The dielectric filter cuts the output by about half but the
this can be varied by 10 percent or so (though I'm not sure if this is
intentional or just a byproduct of it being angled).  The polarizing
filter allows continuous adjustment of
output power.  (In both cases, the adjustment is done by loosening a
set-screw and rotating the end-cap).  According to the CDRH sticker,
the output beam is supposed to be less than 1 mW.  Given the wide swings
in output power during warmup (see below), even with 50 percent attenuation,
the peak output power may approach 1 mW.  But regardless of the type of
end-cap, only a single polarization ever exits the laser since the internal
beam sampler blocks the other one.
<p>
There is a thin film heater attached to a thick rubber jacket
between the tube and laser head cylinder.  A
beam sampler assembly consists of a pair of Beam-Splitter Cubes (BSCs) in
series and two photodiodes, each associated with one of the BSCs.
The first BSC is a polarizing beam-splitter and reflects the full
power of one polarized mode to its photodiode.  Thus, the beam
that passes through it is linearly polarized
with the orthogonal orientation.  The second BSC reflects 10 or 20 percent of
this mode to its photodiode.  So, the output beam
from the laser is pure linearly polarized and has slightly less output power
than one of the polarized modes of the tube.
The controller monitors the lasing modes and maintain cavity length using the
heater so that a pair of orthogonally polarized longitudinal modes straddle
the gain curve.  The beam sensor assembly can be rotated to align the
photosensors with the 2 orthogonal lasing modes as this is arbitrary
from tube to tube, and orientation within the cylinder, but should
remain fixed for the life of the tube.
<p>
The controller can be set up to run on various input voltages from 100 VAC
to 240 VAC by changing the position of a small PCB that plugs into the AC
entrance assembly, and plugging in the appropriate fuse.  However, it seems
that the HeNe laser power supply always runs on 115 VAC from a tap on the main
power transformer so it doesn't need to be capable of 230 VAC operation,
even though the one that's in there has that option - the wire for 230 VAC
is not used!  The output of the HeNe laser power supply is rated 2,100 V at
6.5 mA with no start delay.
<p>
The user controls consist of one (1) power switch.  There are indicators for
AC power and Status.  After a warmup period of 20 minutes or so for the
laser head to reach operating temperature, the Status indicator will
change from Wait (red) to Ready (green).  Doing anything that causes
lock to be lost will result in a shorter delay of a couple minutes to
re-establish it.
<p>
The internal circuitry of the controller box is relatively simple and includes
a pair of LM3403 quad op-amps, a 741 op-amp, and LM311 voltage comparator,
along with a TO5 power transistor on a heatsink to drive the heater.
<p>
Here is the pinout of the circular control connector as determined by my
measurements.  There may be errors.

</PRE>
<p>
It would appear that the difference in sensitivities is the way it's supposed
to be since this was similar on 3 heads.  (However, the readings on an analog
VOM for the photodiodes did differ on 2 heads I tested - I'm not sure what,
if any significance, that has.)  This makes sense given that the sampling
is done from the main beam.  One polarization orientation is blocked entirely
and thus the associated photodiode gets its full intensity.  The other mode
would then seem to be sampled at about 20 percent intensity.  The controller
and laser head are normally a matched pair and there is an adjustment inside
the controller to equalize the responses.
<p>
The heater consists of a serpentine thin file metal pattern on a rubbery
backing material that wraps completely once around the tube.
<p>
The temperature sensor extends the length of the tube and is buried within the
heater backing, technology unknown.
<p>
I picked up a controller and 3 laser heads in two separate eBay auctions
for a grand total of $22.50 + shipping.  The serial number on one of the
heads matched that of the controller and while this head was initially hard
to start, after running it for awhile on my HeNe laser test supply, it now
starts normally.
<p>
The controller originally had a dead HeNe laser power supply brick
(Laser Drive 314S-2100-6.5-2, 2,100 V at 6.5 mA)
which is likely the reason it was taken out of service.  I replaced that
with an Aerotech LSS-5(6.5) which seems to be happy enough.  Using a
laser power meter, one of the two modes of the laser (the one present in
the output beam) could be seen cycling up and down between about 0.60
and 1.40 mW with the orientation of the beam sensor assembly adjusted for
maximum peak power.  Each cycle took longer and longer as the tube warmed
up to operating temperature, helped along by the heater.  After about
15 minutes, it would appear to try to "catch" at certain power levels
but couldn't quite remain there.  (This behavior may have had nothing to
do with the feedback control though.)  Then suddenly, after about 20 minutes,
the Ready light came on and a few seconds later, it locked rock stable at 0.95
mW. :)  A second laser head behaved in a similar manner but with a slightly
higher final output power of 1.02 mW.  No adjustments were needed inside
the controller despite the fact that the second head's serial number
didn't match the controller's serial number.  Possibly, even better
stability or slightly higher stabilized output power could be achieved
with some fine tuning.  (The 1.02 mW head actually had higher peak power than
the 0.95 mW head.  The difference is probably in part due to the photodiode
sensitivities.)  With the fixed filter end-caps installed, the output power
dropped to around 0.50 mW.  I rather suspect that these are normal power
levels for this system.  (This was later confirmed when a manual with detailed
specifications turned up.)  The third head had its cables cut but I finally
scrounged a replacement control connector from a box of junk in the garage
and jerry-rigged the HV BNC for testing.  That laser head now works as well.
It also came with an adjustable polarizer in its end-cap.  With that installed
on either of the other heads, the output power could be varied continuously
from near 0 mW to about 1 mW.
<p>
Note that the Ready light comes on and <i>then</i> the laser
locks in at the proper phase of the next mode cycle.  So, basically
the pea brain in the controller (no actual CPU of any kind!) decides
that conditions are suitable and enables the feedback loop.  The final
"decision" is based the cycle duration being longer than some magic number
(around 1 minute). :)  I've also seen the ready light come on even if the
laser doesn't start and when one of the previously locked heads was plugged
back in after a few minutes of cooling.  In the latter case, the laser was
indeed locked though it might not have been able to maintain it continuously
since the tube was probably no longer really warm enough.
<p>
There are actually two feedback loops in the controller.  During warmup,
the heater is driven to a fixed temperature based on the resistance between
pins 3 and 4 of the Control connector.  Once the period of the mode cycle
exceeds a fixed time (guessing somewhere around 60 seconds), the
control loop based on the difference of the photodiode outputs is enabled.
The same signal that switches from the temperature feedback to mode feedback
turns the Wait indicator goes off and the Ready indicator on.  More on this
in the next section.
<p>
<A HREF="coh200m1.gif">Plot of Coherent Model 200 Stabilized HeNe Laser
Head During Warmup</A> and <A HREF="coh200m2.gif">Plot of Coherent
Model 200 Stabilized HeNe Laser Head Near End of Warmup</A>
show the output power variation due to mode cycling.  Note how it seems to
"snap" into regulation once the time is right. :)  There are roughly 90
mode cycles during warmup prior to lock.  The internal optics
account for the large variation in output power.  The HeNe laser tube
itself has a normal mode sweep of only a few percent.
<p>
Another Coherent 200 system I have has a fully functional controller but
a fully dead laser head.  It is very hard start, impossible to run, and
way beyond end-of-life.  So, that gave me an excuse to go inside.
<p>
The Coherent 200 laser head can be disassembled in a reversible manner
with fewer individual parts than the Spectra-Physics 117/A or the
essentially identical Melles Griot 05-STP-901.  However, it doesn't come
apart as easily, using a press-fit for the tube/heater sandwich.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Loosen the setscrew that secures the output filter/polarizer and then
 unscrew it.
<p>
<li>Remove the setscrew that holds the cable-end end-cap in place.  (It may
 be hidden by the yellow CAUTION sticker.)  The end-cap will then slide
 out but its travel may be limited by the wiring - don't pull!
<p>
<li>Remove the locking screw for the sampling optics, which will then slide
 out (perhaps with some difficulty).  It is attached by 4 color coded wires.
 There may be a way to remove the tube without cutting or disconnecting
 any wires but to prevent damage, I just cut the 4 wires to the sampling
 optics so it could be set aside.  Reattaching 4 wires is no big deal.
<p>
<li>The tube and heater may then be removed through the back (cable-end)
 with the aid of a pill bottle and wooden stick pushed in through the
 output-end. :)  There is no need to do anything about the RTV-filled
 holes.  They secure an outer plastic sleeve which can remain in place.
</ul>
<p>
As noted above, the tube was found to be way beyond end-of-life.  If it could
be convinced to start (on a lab power supply), it would not run at any
reasonable current and produced no output at all.  There was sputtered
aluminum coating on the holes near the cathode end-cap and even through
holes in the cathode can near the center of the tube.  This system had
obviously been left on continuously for a large number of years.  It was
probably not even in use for a good portion of that time, forgotten and lonely
in a corner of a lab, wasting its life producing coherent stabilized photons
no one was using until there were no more! :)  That seems to be the
destiny of so many stabilized HeNe lasers.  I'll be searching for a
suitable replacement tube.  The original tube, a 05-LHR-219 (with or
without a -158), doesn't show up in any list I've seen) but an 05-LHR-120
has nearly the same dimensions and will run on the same power supply.
So, as long as one can be found that is well behaved (non-flipper, wedged
HR), it will almost certainly work fine.  Other random polarized laser
tubes of similar length can also be adapted but may require replacing
the HeNe laser power supply and coming up with a creative mounting scheme
if diameter is smaller.

<h4><A NAME="hstco200s">Schematics of Coherent Model 200 Controller</A></h4>

I have reverse engineered the very nearly complete circuit diagram for the
Coherent Model 200 controller. The only parts not included in the diagram are
the AC line front-end and voltage selection circuitry, the power transformer
for the low voltage power supply, the Laser Drive HeNe laser power supply,
and the detailed wiring of some of the internal connectors.  (The only
internal connector on the drawing is J2, for the cable from the PCB to the
laser head Control connector on the rear panel.  It is labeled J2 on the
PCB copper.)
<p>
Everything is in <A HREF="co200sch.pdf">Schematic of Coherent Model 200
Stabilized HeNe Laser</A>.  Note that most of the part numbering is totally
arbitrary as there were *no* part numbers on the PCB except for the
PCB connectors (and I only have J2 in the drawing).
This is a late revision with PCB artwork dated 1997, though that probably
only means that there was a PCB fab run in 1997, since the artwork itself
was obviously hand taped. :)  I guess some important customer just
had to have more of these lasers made well after they would have been
considered very obsolete by Coherent. :)
<p>
The controller has two feedback loops.  The Preheat Loop, which is
active while the tube is warming up, drives the heater in the laser head
to a fixed temperature (set by a pot).  The temperature sensor in the laser
head is not a common NTC thermistor, but something that increases
in value with increasing temperature.  It has a resistance of around 800 to
900 ohms at room temperature, but well over 1K ohms at operating temperature.
The preheat loop prevents the mode feedback loop from
going active until the temperature is sufficiently high.  Only after
this occurs, does a timer begin to look at mode changes, and switches
from the preheat loop to the mode feedback loop once their period
exceeds around 60 seconds.  The mode feedback loop uses the difference
between the orthogonally polarized A and B modes in a simple PI control loop to
drive the heater.  Should the laser not stabilize as evidenced by mode changes still occurring, the preheat loop will be switched back on to try again.
At least, that seems to be how it's supposed to work.  However, a
system with a laser tube that doesn't start (or a bad HeNe laser power
supply) will likely turn on READY shortly after being powered up even
though it is obviously not working correctly.  Well, I guess it IS
quite stable - dead with a frequency of exactly 0.0000000000 Hz and an
output power of exactly 0.0000000000 mW! :)

<h4><A NAME="hstco200a">Adjustment of Coherent 200</A></h4>

The Coherent Model 200 stabilized HeNe laser controller and laser head
are a matched set and do not automagically mate with each other.
There are 3 pots inside the controller.  Two of them are likely to need
some fine tuning when attaching a laser head that was not originally
sold with the controller.  Although another laser head may appear to
lock, performance with respect to stability and ambient temperature
range may compromised.  There may also have been some subtle changes
in laser head construction over the years, particularly with respect
to the temperature sensor.  Two late model controllers I acquired would
not lock with an older laser head due to the temperature set-point being
too low.  But aside from component drift in the controller, which should
be minimal, there is generally no need to adjust the controller over the
life of a laser head.
<p>
Here is the adjustment procedure.  A multimeter (preferably an analog VOM, with
a needle!) or oscilloscope is required.  A 14 pin "DIP Clip" will come in
handy, and a laser power meter and temperature probe are desirable but not
essential.  A hex wrench to set the output polarizer orientation and
small flat blade screwdriver to adjust the pots will also be needed.
<p>
This should be done from a cold start at an ambient temperature
close to where the laser will typically be used.  If the laser had
been on, it should be turned off and allowed to cool down for a half hour
minimum before proceeding.
<p>
A printout of the <A HREF="co200sch.pdf">Schematic of Coherent Model 200
Stabilized HeNe Laser</A> will come in handy.
<p>
<b>Preparation</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Near the output end of the laser head is a slot with a hex screw
 positioned somewhere along its length.  This allows the orientation
 of the output polarizer and beam sampler to be optimally set to line
 up the polarization axes of the laser tube.  If this is still covered
 or sealed, there is probably no need to touch it as this will not
 likely change over the life of the tube.  Otherwise, or just
 to be sure, have the proper hex wrench available to turn this screw.
<p>
<li>Remove the cover of the controller.  This requires taking out
 two semi-recessed Philips screws in the rear and sliding the chassis out
 of the box.  On some units, the large main filter capacitor will get
 stuck on the front bezel and require pressing down the PCB to free it.
<p>
<li>Connect the laser HV and control cables, and the power cord.
<p>
<li>Locate U1 and U2 (my numbering).  U1 is the LM3403 furthest in the rear
 and U2 is the one in front of it.  Also locate the labeled test points
(TP-A through TP-G) near the front of the PCB.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Mode A and B adjustment</b>
<p>
The balance between the two polarized modes will affect the location
of the lasing line on the neon gain curve.  The following sets the
two mode amplitudes to be equal, which places the modes equidistant
on either side of the gain curve.  However, it should be possible to
offset the modes if desired, if a different location or slightly more
output power in Mode A (the output beam) is desired.  However, it's not
possible to place either mode precisely at the top of the gain curve.
<p>
<ol start=5>
<li>Attach the positive probe of the multimeter to TP-D (VC+, the midpoint
 reference).  Attach the negative probe of the multimeter to U1-1.  (The
 polarity doesn't matter for a DMM or scope, but for an analog multimeter,
 this way around will result in a positive reading.
<p>
<li>Turn the laser on.  If a laser power meter is available, it can
 be used to monitor the output.  If the Ready indicator comes on initially.
 wait until the Wait indicator comes on, so the laser is in Preheat mode,
<p>
<li>As the laser tube heats up and expands, the modes will sweep through the
 neon gain curve and the voltage on U1-1 will vary periodically from a
 minimum to a maximum.  The laser power meter will show a similar behavior
 since this is Mode A which is the same mode that exits as the main beam.
<p>
<li>If the hex screw in that slot near the end of the laser head
 is still covered or sealed in place, this step can be skipped as the
 orientation of the beam sampler with respect to the tube is unlikely to
 have changed.  Otherwise - or just to be sure - loosen slightly - but
 don't remove - the hex screw.  Slide it back and forth in the slot to maximize
 the voltage swing of Mode A and tighten the hex screw.  The maximum will
 typically be around 1 V and may occur with the screw positioned anywhere
 in the slot or at one end.  On the one I checked, the sensitivity was
 actually about 1/2 V per mW of laser output power in Mode A.
<p>
<li>Note the maximum reading of the Mode A voltage.
<p>
<li>Move the probe from U1-1 to U1-14.
<p>
<li>Adjust the Mode B pot (R14, next to U1), so that the maximum reading is
 the same as in step 9, above.  (Mode B is blocked by the polarizer at the
 output of the laser head.)  Counterclockwise rotation increases gain.
<p>
<li>Go back to U1-1 and check that it is still about the same as before.
 As the tube warms up, the output power will typically increase somewhat.
 If this is the case, readjust R14 to make Modes A and B voltage equal.
<p>
<li>Attach the multimeter between the case or TP-F (signal ground, negative)
 and U1-7 or TP-A (the Mode Difference Amplifier, positive) to confirm that
 its output is swinging from near 0 V to over 20 V along with the mode sweep.
 Unless the laser tube is very weak, this voltage will probably be at
 each extreme most of the time and will move relatively rapidly between them.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Temperature adjustment</b>
<p>
The HeNe laser tube and ballast resistors dissipate almost 12 W (1.8 kV at
6.5 mA).  The temperature set-point must be selected such that it is slightly
above what would result from the tube and ballast power alone.  At an ambient
temperature of 18 &deg;C, the required temperature set-point ends up being
around 40 &deg;C, a difference of 22 &deg;C.  I do not know exactly how this
is affected by a change in ambient temperature.  If the difference remains
constant, the head must run at 62 &deg;C for the maximum allowable operating
temperature of 40 &deg;C (from the specifications in the Coherent manual).
Such a high operating temperature seems unrealistic.
<p>
One way to estimate the value for the temperature set-point is power only the
laser HeNe laser tube (not the heater) by disconnecting the Control
cable and allow it to reach thermal equilibrium (at least 1/2 hour).
Measure its temperature and then reconnect the Control cable and adjust
the Temperature set-point to be about 5 &deg;C higher, or so that the mode
sweep goes through an additional 15 full cycles.
<p>
The following assumes an ambient temperature of 18 &deg;C:
<p>
<ol start=14>
<li>Monitor the temperature of the laser head cylinder.  If you have a
 temperature probe, tape it to the center of the cylinder with some
 thermal insulation covering it.  If not, your calibrated thumb will
 have to do.
<p>
<li>Watch the mode changes either with a laser power meter or with the
 multimeter on TP-A or U1-7.
<p>
<li>Once they slow down to a full cycle in 30 seconds or so, check the
 temperature of the laser head.  It should be about 40 &deg;C.  If it is
 lower, slowly turn the Temperature pot (R1, next to U2), clockwise to
 increase the temperature set-point.  This will increase the frequency of
 the mode changes.  If it is higher than 40 &deg;C, turn R1 counterclockwise.
 If this causes the mode changes to cease, and the laser to lock, it may
 be necessary to shut it off for 5 minutes to allow the tube to cool
 a bit.  The goal is for the laser head temperature to stabilize just
 above the maximum ambient temperature of the Coherent Model 200 laser
 specifications.  (If no temperature probe is available, 40 &deg;C, is
 warm but not hot, slightly above normal human body temperature of 37 &deg;C.)
<p>
<li>Give the laser time to stabilize.  This will occur once the full mode sweep
 cycle is more than about 1 minute.
<p>
<li>After the green Ready indicator comes on, the laser output power
 on the laser power meter should quickly settle down and then remain very
 nearly constant approximately mid-way between the minimum and maximum.
 The short term fluctuations should be no more than a fraction of
 1 percent.  Check the voltage on TP-G, the drive voltage to the heater.  It
 should be relatively constant in the range 5 to 10 V.
<p>
 Note that the range of 5 to 10 V is my estimate.  The Coherent manual shows
 a graph with the voltage at 12 V at the time of lock (which would then likely
 drop down to under 10 V after thermal equilibrium).  But there is no
 description or indication of what ambient temperature was used.  Perhaps
 some key piece of information is missing.  While there's no
 problem adjusting the temperature so the laser locks and is stable at any
 given ambient temperature or a reasonable range around it like +/-5 &deg;C,
 I don't see any practical way the laser could be set up to operate over the
 entire 0 to 40 &deg;C range spec'd in the manual without running
 excessively hot, especially under typical conditions (below 25 &deg;C).
 It would make more sense if R2 was a sensor for ambient temperature so
 that the temperature set-point was an offset from ambient rather
 than actual temperature, but R2 looks like an ordinary resistor.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the voltage is too close to 0 V, the laser will probably
  lose lock after awhile since the need for heater power tends to
  decline slightly as all parts of the laser heat reach thermal equilibrium
  and there's then no way to go low enough.
<p>
 <li>If the voltage is between 10 and 20 V, the temperature
  set-point is too high and the laser will be running hotter than necessary,
  but will probably still remain locked.
<p>
 <li>If the voltage continues to fluctuate over a wide range, or remains
  stuck at 0 V or above 20 V even after Ready has been on for a minute
  or more, then the laser is unable to lock because the temperature
  set-point is too low or too high.  In this case, the Wait and Ready
  indicators will probably switch back and forth at a very slow rate
  (minutes) - forever.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Assuming the voltage on TP-G is in a reasonable range and the ambient
 temperature is similar to what it will be during use, monitor TP-G for
 a couple hours.  The voltage on TP-G will likely decline slightly as all
 parts of the laser head come to thermal equilibrium, but should never be less
 than 3 or 4 V.  If it does go close to 0 V, power off for 5 minutes and
 power on to reset to Preheat Mode, and turn the Temperature pot clockwise
 a couple turns to increase the temperature set-point.  If the voltage is
 too high, turn the pot a couple turns counterclockwise to lower the
 temperature set-point.  Then check TP-G after it lock.  (If the laser
 isn't off for long enough, the Ready indicator will come on immediately
 and it may lock immediately.  In that case, leave it off for longer and
 try again!)
<p>
 If the laser will be used in an environment where the ambient temperature
 is much different than where it was tested, readjustment may be needed.
 The official Coherent Adjustment Procedure (CAP) probably sets the
 temperature so high that this would not be required over the full
 spec'd temperature range of 0 to 40 &deg;C, but that shouldn't
 be necessary unless the laser is to be used near in a sauna. :)
</ol>
<p>
<b>Mode feedback gain adjustment</b>
<p>
<ol start=20>
<li>The third pot, Loop Gain (R20, near the front of the PCB), can probably
 be left alone.  The controllers I've checked were all set to 0 ohms.  It
 might make a difference with a very weak tube - or it may just be filling
 a set of holes!  But in the case where your tube is way under 1 mW for the
 peak output, increasing the Loop Gain might help short term stability.
 Otherwise, there's probably no reason to touch it unless someone
 before you twiddled everything.
</ol>
<p>
Finally, power off for 1/2 hour and confirm that the laser will then
stabilize properly (after the warmup period) when powered back on.
<p>
One other thing that's recommended while the case is opened is to check
R39 and R40, the third and forth resistors from the right in the first
row at the front of the PCB.  These are the current limiting
resistors for the Wait and Ready indicators, respectively, and were
originally 510 and 1K ohms, both apparently 1/4 W (by size and appearance).
There are other current limiting resistors inside the indicator
packages, but the voltage across R39 and R40 may still be high enough
to greatly exceed the 1/4 W ratings of the original resistors.  If so,
the PCB will probably be darkened beneath them as well.  Measure the
voltage across R39 and R40 when their respective indicator is lit.
If either is more than 20 V and the resistor is only 1/4 W,
replacement is highly desirable, especially for
R40 which will be stressed possibly for years on end. :)  Suitable
values are 1K, at least 1/2 W for both.  Yes, Ready won't be quite
as bright but it will be much happier!  Proper replacement will require
removing the PCB but this is just five screws and several connectors.
Space the new resistors off the PCB a bit to further aid in cooling.
The PCB is easily damaged, so use a proper desoldering tool to remove
the old resistors and clean up the holes.  Or just cut the leads off
at the bodies of the old resistors and solder to those.

<h4><A NAME="hstco200r">Replacement of HeNe Laser Tube in Coherent 200</A></h4>

Some samples of the CO-200 found on eBay have hard-start but usable
tubes (if you're very lucky), but most have tubes that are terminally
ill and sputter with very low output power (end-of-life), or are simply
dead as a glass bottle.  The HeNe laser tube in the CO-200 is a Melles
Griot 05-LHR-219, which runs on 2,100 V at 6.5 mA.  This is physically
and electrically identical (or close enough for government work!) to the
common 05-LHR-120, a tube with a rated output power of 2 mW, though new
ones may approach 4 mW.
<p>
The first step in tube replacement is to find a suitable tube.  Melles
Griot probably won't even sell you a tube, and if they did, it would
cost $300 to $400!  Although a common type, this seems to be harder
to find surplus than it would appear.  Most of those that turn up on
eBay seem to be the 05-LHP-120 - the polarized version - which is useless
for this purpose.  Once a suitable candidate tube has been found, it
needs to be tested for non-flipper behavior.  A tube that is a flipper
may still be useful if the flipping is consistent, or if it disappears
when the tube warms up, but a totally well behaved non-flipper is most
desirable.
<p>
<b>CO-200 laser head disassembly:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the front bezel.  This either unscrews (there may be a set-screw
 locking it in place) or is held on with a set-screw.  The front bezel usually
 contains an angled neutral density filter.
<p>
<li>Remove any black RTV silicone securing the angular adjustment of the
 beam sampler and then free the beam sampler from the laser head cylinder.
 It should be possible to pull it far enough out that the 4 conductor
 ribbon cable is accessible.  Cut this about 1 inch from the beam sampler
 and set the beam sampler aside.  Make a note of the position of the
 rubber heater jacket is inside the laser head cylinder.
<p>
<li>Remove the rear end-cap with the cables by unscrewing the single set-screw
 (it may be concealed by the yellow safety label) and setting it aside
 in a safe place.  Gently pull the end-cap out of the
 cylinder.  If it doesn't come freely, the anode wire is preventing it
 from moving so it may be necessary to push the
 entire tube out of the laser head from the front.  Stacked pill bottles
 are useful for this.  Since the old tube is dead, extreme care isn't
 required.  But if reasonable force doesn't budge the tube, it may be
 necessary to free up the outer plastic liner from its 12 blobs of RTV
 silicone securing it to the inside of the laser head cylinder.  There
 are 12 small access holes through which a dental pick or narrow piece of
 steel can be wedged to cut it free.
<p>
<li>Once the tube/heater assembly has been freed, it will become obvious
 how clunky this setup really is.  The tube is simply held in place by
 the heater jacket - it's not glued to it.  Make a note of the location
 of the tube relative to the heater jacket.  Make a note of the orientation
 relative to the heater jacker of the photodiode ribbon cable and green
 cathode wire that runs the length of the laser head
<p>
<li>Regardless of whether the outer plastic liner came free initially,
 it will probably be necessary to remove it so that the replacement
 tube with the heater jacket can be installed without excessive force.
 Assuming this is the case, remove as much of the RTV residue from the
 inside of the laser head cylinder as possible.
<p>
<li>Use a 6-32 tap to thread six of the holes from which the
 RTV was removed (3 at each end) to accept nylon screws.  These
 will be very useful for centering the tube and aligning its beam,
 especially with the beam sampler, which is rather critical.
</ol>
<p>
<b>CO-200 laser head reassembly:</b>
<p>
<ol start=7>
<li>Peel off the tape securing the heater jacket to the laser tube
 and install the replacement tube at the same longitudinal location
 in the heater jacket and secure with fresh tape.  Add the photodiode
 ribbon cable and cathode wire and secure with tape before installing the
 outer plastic wrap.  I recommend also adding an extra layer of high voltage
 insulating plastic around the tube running about 2 inches beyond the glass
 at the anode end.  This in addition to the smaller insulating sleeve that
 was there to begin with.  Don't forget to install the anode HV clip on the
 mirror mount stem and the cathode wire on the exhaust tip-off!
<p>
<li>With luck, it should now be possible to push the entire assembly
 consisting of the tube, heater jacket, plastic sleeve, photodiode ribbon
 cable and cathode wire back into the laser head.  However, this is rather
 tricky since the anode wire is just long enough to reach to the mirror
 mount stem, and needs to be relatively straight to minimize the possibility
 of high voltage arcing, though the dual layer of insulating sleeves should
 take care of this.  Once the assembly is part way in, it may be necessary
 to pull it the remaining distance from the front.  The orientation really
 doesn't matter that much except that there is a hole in which the set-screw
 for the rear end-cap seats.  Otherwise, the polarization axes will be
 determined after everything's buttoned up.  The beam sampler orientation
 will take care of optimizing that.  Once the rear end-cap is all the way in
<p>
<li>At this point, it is probably a good idea to test the HeNe laser tube
 This can be easily done from the CO-200 controller.  There is no interlock
 so the laser should come on when AC power is applied after a delay of a
 few seconds even without the control connector attached.  In fact, it's
 best to do it that way as any major oops like a HV short will not destroy
 the controller!
<p>
<li>Assuming a successful test, reconnect the 4 photodiode wires to the
 ribbon cable.  Use heat-shrink tubing to insulate them.  Take care not
 to flex the wires to the photodiodes as they are somewhat fragile.
<p>
<li>Replace the beam sampler.  Install six nylon screws to adjust the
 centering of the beam in the output of the beam sampler.
 CAUTION: Don't force the nylon screws, just gentle finger tightness!
<p>
<li>Go to <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstco200a">Adjustment of Coherent 200</A>,
 with the added step that the beam centering may need to be find tuned
 to maximize the photodiode signals.
</ol>
<p>
I found an old 05-LHR-121 laser head with a good tube, extracted the tube,
and spent way too much time installing it in a CO-200 laser head that
had a nearly dead tube.  This included a liberal application of duct
tape and bailing wire. :)  But it works.  I knew that this particular
tube was a flipper and expected to simply pick the proper mode polarity
such that it would lock on the opposite side of the gain curve from
the one that flipped.  However, it turned out to only flip until it
warms up for about 4 minutes or 113 half-mode cycles, then abruptly it
stops flipping and becomes well behaved.  I have an Aerotech tube with
similar behavior, cause unknown.
<p>
I don't think this is in what might be called original condition, but it
does start right up without problems (no hard-start tube!) and has decent
power (3.2 mW or more total from the tube).  It locks normally with
1.2+ mW in a single mode.
<p>
All in all though, much more effort is required to do a tube replacement on
the CO-200 than the SP-117/A.
<p>
The controller that went along with this laser head also had minor problems.
I had to replace the usual toated dropping resistor for the READY LED but
also had to totally rebuild the READY LED assembly itself - both LEDs and
their current limiting resistors were fried to a crisp. :( :)

<h2>Excel Precision Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.excelprecision.com/">Excel Precision</A> is another
manufacturer of metrology systems based on laser interferometry.  Though
not as well known as HP/Agilent or Zygo, and having a more limited product
line, their system components are similar including lasers, interferometer
optics, environmental compensators, and processing electronics.
<A HREF="http://www.excelprecision.com/splash/excel_datasheet.pdf">Laser
Interferometry Tools for Precision Measurement</A> is a summary of
their product offerings.  Many of the components have direct HP/Agilent

way of useful information on their Web site except one page on the
1100B 6DOF Calibration System.
<p>
Excel has only a single type of laser, the 1001, a Zeeman-split HeNe laser
with a split/REF frequency between 1.5 and 3.0 MHz.  But there are at least
2 different case styles.  The 1001A and 1001F seem to be similar or identical
to the smaller HP/Agilent lasers.  I don't know what the difference is
between them.  The 1001B may be more along the lines of an HP-5518A with
a built-in optical receiver.  But it's not clear if the 1100B 6DOF
Calibration System uses the 1001B laser. :)

<h3><A NAME="hstep1f">Excel 1001F Two-Frequency HeNe Laser Head</A></h3>

The Excel 1001F is physically similar to the small 5517 lasers.  However, the
spec'd REF frequency is from 1.5 to 3 MHz, so it's not really equivalent to
any of them.  Possibly, one can request a particular REF frequency range
via an option, rather than a different model laser.  Or, perhaps it starts
out close to 1.5 MHz and increases with use and normal power decline until
3.0 MHz is considered end-of-life.  The nominal wavelength
spec is also the same as that of the 5501A/B, 5517A/B, and 5518A - 632.99137
nm.  The difference(s), if any, between the 1001A and 1001F are not known.
<p>
Several photos of the Excel 1001F laser can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 3.00
or higher) under "Excel Precision HeNe Lasers".
<p>
The two most interesting ones are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="ex1fli.jpg">Excel 1001F Laser Left Side Interior View</A> shows
 the control PCB with its five (5) trimpots! :)  The green connectors are
 from left to right: Photodiode input, Tube heater, HeNe laser power supply,
 Power/Reference, LEDs.
<p>
<li><A HREF="ex1fri.jpg">Excel 1101F Laser Right Side Interior View</A> shows
 the shielded HeNe laser power supply at the lower right with the ballast
 resistor at the lower left.  The fat red (anode) and gray (cathode) wires
 are clearly visible.
</ul>
<p>
Here are some observations/comments:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The 1001F is very nicely constructed - better than even the 5517s - with
 a solid machined baseplate and careful attention to detail all around so the
 manufacturing cost must be greater than that of the HP/Agilent lasers.  It
 is also about 50 percent heavier!  The 1001F is a drop in physical
 replacement for the small HP/Agilent 5517 lasers except that when
 using the standard Excel metal feet, the beam is a
 few mm lower.  (HP/Agilent feet may eliminate even this minor difference.)
 The cover is held on by 4 screws and there is an interlock on the +15
 VDC supply to disable the laser when the cover is removed.
<p>
<li>The cable connector and pinout are compatible with the 5517 lasers
 but -15 VDC is not used at all.  The 1001F plugs in and runs fine
 on my interferometer setup with the HP-5508A Measurement Display.  This
 was no doubt intentional as the connector is custom for the 5517.  See
 the next section for pinouts.
<p>
<li>The tube is well buried inside the magnet/optics assembly.  Although
 probably not sealed, there are no obvious holes to view the interior
 so I do not know yet whether it is a fully custom tube as used in all
 HP/Agilent lasers, or a conventional tube, possibly with some modifications.
 The Excel blurb says that the tube is built in their facility, but that
 could simply mean the tube assembly and not the actual glass laser tube.
 The wiring arrangement is consistent with cathode-end output and HV
 connections at opposite ends of the tube, and a separate cable for the
 heater.  Based on the warmup time of almost 8 minutes suggesting an
 external heater (more below), separate heater wiring, and the HV
 wiring at opposite ends of the tube, the use of a semi-custom
 conventional tube is quite probable.
<p>
<li>The magnet itself is about the same length as the ones in the HP/Agilent
 lasers - about 9.5 cm.  This was determined by sensing fringe fields with
 a with a Sam's Laser FAQ-approved divining rod. :)
<p>
<li>The HeNe laser power supply is a small brick shielded with foil inside
 an outer sheet metal shield with a large potted ballast resistor attached
 to the baseplate.  There is no current adjustment that I could find.
<p>
<li>The optics assembly attached to the tube has a beam expander and
 waveplates, but only the 1/2 waveplate is accessible, with a similar
 type of construction and the same adjustments (tilt and orientation) as
 found in all the HP/Agilent lasers.  So, either the 1/4 waveplate never
 needs adjustment, or that is assumed to be something that would only be
 done by Excel laser guru types.
<p>
<li>Feedback is via a separate beam sampler feeding a pair of photodiodes
 looking at the orthogonal polarized output modes rather than any funky LCD.
 There are labeled trimpots for the PD1 and PD2, as well as REF (presumably
 reference sensitivity).  So, it is likely that the actual optical frequency
 can be fine tuned, as well as being able to compensate for tube aging.
 But of course this does mean that periodic tweaking may be desirable,
 if not essential.
<p>
<li>Warmup requires a much longer time than for most of the HP/Agilent 5517
 lasers.  I measured just under 8 minutes (7:55), though the spec allows
 for up to 15 minutes.  Nearly all of this time is taken reaching the
 temperature set-point.  Virtually as soon as it switches to optical
 feedback (or perhaps coincident with it), the READY LED comes on -
 no flashing READY before this.  There is a trimpot labeled "TEMP"
 which is probably the temperature set-point adjust, as well as another
 unmarked one near it.  Interrupting HeNe laser tube power by releasing
 the case interlock switch causes the READY LED to go off.  Restoring it
 then results in almost immediate lock and READY.
<p>
<li>As can be seen, replacement of the tube assembly in a 1001F appears to be
 a rather involved task.  Unlike the HP/Agilent lasers where it is literally a
 5 minute process involving a screw driver and some connectors, the 1001F tube
 assembly is hard-wired into the HeNe laser power supply, so everything has to
 be removed and replaced together.  And then adjustments will be required
 on the control PCB.
<p>
<li>Testing with a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI) shows that the
 1001F has a pure single split Zeeman mode with no rogue modes lasing when
 locked.  The range over which this is true is quite narrow as evidenced
 during warmup - one other mode is always present except when the main
 mode is very close to where the locked position will be - at the center of
 the Zeeman-split neon gain curve.
<p>
<li>Since the vacuum wavelength of 632.99137 nm is the same as that of the
 HP/Agilent 5501A/B, 5517A/B, and 5518A (and probably all the others), the
 gas-fill isotope ratio and pressure must be similar as well.  If other
 aspects of construction are similar, then a cavity length of as much as
 127 mm like that of the HP/Agilent 5517B lasers is possible.  But it could
 be shorter, probably as short as 100 mm to prevent rogue modes from lasing.
<p>
<li>The control PCB seen in <A HREF="ex1flcb.jpg">Excel 1001F Laser Control
 PCB</A> is nearly totally analog with only a few gates for miscellaneous
 functions but no state machines or sequencers.  The heater is on
 continuously and the mode sweep is constant throughout warmup, slowing
 down gradually until the switch to optical feedback mode and locking
 takes place after reaching the temperature set-point.  The connectors
 from left to right:

<p>
<li>The output power of my sample is approximately 270 &micro;W, which is a bit
 low compared to the original value of 335 &micro;W) printed on the backplate
 but well above the spec'd minimum of 200 &micro;W.  And the output power
 doesn't change by more than a few percent after extended warmup
 indicating that the tube is relatively healty - no gas contamination and not
 end-of-life.  The laser is fully functional with a REF frequency
 of around 2.22 MHz.  So, it's equivalent to a 5517B.  (Specs for the 5517B:
 Minimum output power of 120 &micro;W, REF frequency of 1.9 to 2.4 MHz.)
</ul>
<p>
So, I need to find a dead Excel laser to go inside. :)

<h2>Hewlett-Packard/Agilent Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hstgohp">General Overview of HP Interferometry Lasers</A></h3>

Hewlett-Packard manufactured a variety of stabilized two frequency
HeNe lasers for use in applications like very precise interferometric
metrology, essentially distance, velocity, straithness, and angle
measurement using the wavelength of light as the reference.  These
lasers are now sold under the Agilent name but since they were
developed by HP, that's the designation we'll continue to use most often!
<p>
The general approach is shown in <A HREF="inter2f.gif">Interferometer
Using Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A>.  The capabilities of this approach
are quite impressive.  A typical example is the HP-5501B laser head from
the HP-5501A Laser Interferometry Measurement System, which enables a
position/distance resolution down to better than 10 nm (that's nanometer
as in 0.000000001 meter!).  More information on inteferometers based on
two frequency lasers including descriptions of the optical components
can be found in the section:

Here is a comparison of most of the HP two frequency metrology laser models.

<p>
Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The 5500A was the original HP interferometery
 laser, with built-in linear interferometer optics so that the only
 required external optical component was a retro-reflector (cube-corner)
 on the moving tool.  The 5500B seems to be physically and functionally
 similar to the 5500A with the same tube but perhaps upgraded electronics.
<p>
<li>The 5500C is the only laser that has a set of 2 optical receivers for an
 external return beam built-in.  Each one uses a pair of photodiodes on either
 side of the beam, which may be selected to be horizontal or vertical
 by the orientation of the front shutter plate depending on the
 interferometer setup.  This is part of the reason for the 5500C's huge
 case.  (They all have an internal optical
 receiver for monitoring the beam to confirm that the beat frequency is
 present and that there is adequate output power.)
<p>
 The 5518A and 5519A/B have a single optical receiver built-in.  And of all
 the HP metrology lasers, the 5519s are unique is having a built-in DC power
 supply so they simply plug into the wall and feed their REF and MEAS signals
 to the associated measurement processor/display.
<p>
 Like the 5500C, the 5518A or 5519A/B can be used in the normal way (e.g.,
 in a 5528A Laser Measurement System), but are generally intended to
 be set up stand-alone without any additional optical receivers in a
 5529A Dynamic Calibrator.  For example, the 5519A laser head can be mounted
 on a cart and aimed through interferometer optics at a cube-corner
 (retro-reflector) or plane mirror on a tool whose motion needs to be
 measured precisely.
<p>
<li>The 5501B is a drop-in functional replacement for the 5501A.  However,
 since the 5501B uses thermal rather than PZT tuning, the time from power on
 to lock is typically 5-9 minutes instead of a few seconds.  And the 5501A
 has an additional connector, not present on the 5501B, so if associated
 equipment depended on signals from the laser, substitutes would have to
 be provided - somehow.  Going the other way - replacing a 5501B with a
 5501A will also work subject to one requirement: After several hours,
 especially from a cold start, the 5501A may need a "Retune" cycle, normally
 initiated by a pushbutton on the rear panel or an external signal.
<p>
<li>The stabilization in all of these lasers is done by balancing the DC
 amplitude of the two linearly polarized Zeeman modes, F1 and F2.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The 5500A/B/C and 5501A use a PZT to control cavity length so
  locking is achieved within about 10 seconds.  They use a tube assembly which
  is totally different than those in all the other HP/Agilent lasers
  including the 5501B.  The original patent for
  the 5500A/B laser tube is: U.S. Patent #3,771,066: Gas Laser and the
  substantially identical "Divisional Application", now
  U.S. Patent #3,889,207: Frequency Stabilized Gas Laser.  The
  5500C and 5501A tubes are slightly different, mainly in
  that there is a single terminal post for the PZT connection with no
  waste beam out the back, and the optics (waveplates and beam expander)
  are part of the tube assembly.
<p>
  The polarizing beam-splitter that detects the modes is deliberately
  oriented so that the separation isn't perfect and a small amount both
  F1 and F2 are present in each.  This results in a beat frequency being
  generated which is used to produce the reference signal (REF) and to
  confirm that there is enough beam power to be usable.  
<p>
 <li>All the other lasers use a heater inside the laser tube (thermal
  tuning) to control cavity length so locking typically requires 4 minutes.
  Laser with the "L" suffix have a vented cover.  Though my 5517E also
  has a vented cover so maybe it's really a 5517EL even if it's labeled
  5517E!  The beam height for the "L" versions also differs
  slightly - 80.8 mm instead of 79.5 mm.  Can you spell "kludge"? :)
<p>
  Although locking typically occurs in 4 minutes (READY comes on solid),
  some lasers (perhaps the 5517F and 5517G) may require 20 minutes.  My
  5517E takes about 9 or 10 minutes.  But a fully stable frequency
  output requires 90 minutes for lasers with a non-vented cover or a vented
  cover but no fan.  Those with a vented cover and a fan require only 45
  minutes.  From my observations, the frequency oscillates slightly
  immediately after locking with a period of order of minutes.  The
  amplitude of these oscillations gradually decreases with time and
  eventually becomes very small.  However, the laser likely still meets
  accuracy specifications during this time.
<p>
  An internal optical receiver samples part of the output beam and is used
  to generate the references signal and to confirm that there is enough
  beam power to be usable.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>All of the lasers that use thermal tuning except for the 5501B have
 virtually identical electronics, though the Control PCBs are not physically
 interchangeable between lasers in the small and large cases mostly due to
 mounting configurations.  Some of the newest versions (by date) of the 5517s,
 have had at least two major redesigns of the Control PCBs (reason unknown).
 These appear to be much more complex and use FPGA/FPLDs and/or DSPs in place
 of simple logic.  This may have been done by Agilent for some specific option
 or OEM requirement.  The four LEDs on the outside are the same but there
 are a few more on the Control PCB.  On the more common of these fancy
 Control PCBs, I believe the functions of the jumpers and even the
 temperature set-point pot are similar.  But a much more complex later
 version (only found on a sample of a 5517E) has changed dramatically.
<p>
 The 5501B is the only laser to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) rather than
 pure analog to drive the heater inside the laser tube.  This was probably
 done to reduce power dissipation in the electronics, but does result in
 modulation of the optical frequency by the PWM.
<p>
<li>The usable maximum velocity will depend on the reference
 frequency (REF) of the specific laser.  The values given are the worst case
 for the minimum of the specification for REF in the direction that reduces
 the MEAS Dopplar frequency. The approximate maximum velocity for a given
 laser in meters/second can be calculated
 using the equation: Vmax=(REF-100kHz)*3.16E-7.  The maximum velocity
 is cut in half with the plane mirror interferometer since it doubles
 the Dopplar frequency shift (and doubles resolution).  (Note that the value
 of REF really doesn't limit the velocity in the opposite direction, though
 the electronics will impose restrictions depending on optical receiver
 bandwidth and data processing implementation.)
<p>
<li>The tube assemblies in the 5501B and 5517B/C/D including the tube
 and magnet, beam expander/collimator, and waveplates, are physically
 similar, though of course the reference frequencies differ.  And the
 specific collimators will depend on the beam diameter option.  The
 structure on these are all nicely machined aluminum except for the
 cast base metal base.  A diagram is shown
 in <A HREF="hp5517t1.gif">Internal Structure of Hewlett Packard/Agilent
 5501B and 5517B/C/D Laser Tube Assemblies</A> and a photo of an intact
 one in <A HREF="5517b-t1.jpg">Tube Assembly Used in HP-5501B and
 HP-5517B/C/D Two-Frequency HeNe Lasers</A>, and after being
 taken apart in <A HREF="5517b-t2.jpg">Major Components of
 HP/Agilent 5517B/C/D or 5501B Tube Assembly</A>.  The tube
 assemblies in the 5517A, 5518A, and 5519A/B lasers are quite different,
 being of cast base metal and also much larger, though the actual glass
 tube, magnet, waveplates, and optics themselves are the same as in the
 other lasers.  The cast assemlies do have more heatsink surface area
 but and this improves stability, though it seems excessive given the
 relatively low power dissipation of all these lasers.  They do have
 precise keying pegs so no alignment is needed when swapping tube
 assemblies.  Except for the physical mounting, the diagram, above,
 applies to these as well.  However, it is possible that the length
 of the Backing Cylinder in front of the OC mirror may depend on the
 particular model to shorten the cavity for those with a
 higher REF frequency, but I haven't seen the inside of enough of them yet
 to know for sure!  The 5517E tube is a bit shorter.  I have
 not seen any 5517FLs or 5517Gs.  The 5501B also differs
 in that the waveplates at the output are oriented to put the F1 and F2
 frequency components at 90 degress compared to the other thermally tuned
 lasers (but is the same as the 5501A).  I have yet to hear any explanation,
 (let alone a credible one!) of why HP changed the orientation after
 the 5501A/B lasers!
<p>
 There's no way to tell the version (e.g., 5517C) or
 reference frequency (e.g., 2.3 MHz) of the tube itself by inspection
 of the assembly or from its label.  They don't have that information
 explicitly, only a part number:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>5500A: ???.
 <li>5500B: ???.
 <li>5500C: 05500-60033.
 <li>5501A: 05501-60006.
 <li>5501B: 05501-60102.
 <li>5517A: 05517-60301, 05517-60501.
 <li>5517B: 05517-60201 (???), 05517-68201 (???), 05517-69201 (???).
 <li>5517C: 05517-68218 (3 mm?), 05517-68217 (6 mm?). 05517-68249 (3 mm?).
 <li>5517D: 05517-68224, 05517-68234 (C29?).
 <li>5518A: 05518-60301.
 <li>5519A: 05519-60301.
 </ul>
<p>
 The difference in tube part numbers for same model lasers isn't entirely
 clear.  It may be a combination of the size of the beam optics and
 other special features like a particularly high REF frequency or
 high output power option.
<p>
 As noted, the older 5501A and 5500C use physically identical tubes
 with PZT tuning.  The tubes in the 5500A and 5500B are the same and
 functionally similar to those in the 5501A and 5500C, but
 the construction differs enough to make it impractical to substitute for
 those.  None of these tubes are compatible with any of the other
 lasers.  The chart below shows the Physical (P) and Reference frequency (R)
 compatibility of the various thermally-tuned HP/Agilent lasers:

<p>
 <li>The metal casting of older 5517A tube assemblies may require minor
  trimming if being installed in 5519A/B lasers to provide clearance for
  the internal switchmode power supply.
<p>
 <li>If installing a 5501B tube in a 5517B/C/D laser or vice-versa, the
  waveplates must be adjusted to rotate the output polarization 90 degrees
  and swap the axes of the F1 and F2 modes - which are interchanged compared
  for the 5501 compared to the 5517 (reason unknown).  The laser will not lock
  at the proper location - or at all - otherwise since the slopes of the split
  gain curves at the lock point would have the wrong sign.  And even if it
  did lock somehow, the sign of position changes would be reversed.  I had
  originally assumed this would just involve rotating the inner barrel of
  the half waveplate (the waveplate assembly at the very end of the tube
  assembly) 45 degrees.  But on the one sample I tried, this seemed to
  result in impure modes.  So, perhaps that waveplate isn't 1/2 wave in
  the 5501B, or it might have needed adjustment of the outer barrel to
  make it pure 1/2 wave.  Or, to avoid any need for waveplate tinkering, simply
  swap the drive signals to the LCD on the beam sampler PCB.
<p>
 <li>It is not known whether 5517E/F/G tubes may be swapped with other
  5517 tubes, or among themselves.  Although the 5517E case is
  the same size as the others, its tube is slightly shorter.  But
  it does come with a series resistor to make the heater resistance
  similar to the others.

<li>Specifications for the 5517E are mostly unknown except for the beam

There are photos of various HP/Agilent metrology lasers in
the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 2.32
or higher) under "Hewlett Packard HeNe Lasers".  These include the 5501A
laser head and tube, the 5501B laser head, (which is physically similar
to the 5517B/C/D except for the connectors), and the 5517A, 5519A, and 5519A/B
laser heads.  I think the older 5501A tube looks much cooler than the
newer ones. :)
<p>
The most significant difference between the various lasers is in the Zeeman
split reference frequency.  A higher frequency enables a faster slew
rate for position and velocity measurements.  As of Winter, 2010, all the
5517s and 5519s are current Agilent products.  General information,
descriptions, and specifications may be
found by going to <A HREF="http://www.agilent.com/">Agilent</A>
and searching for "laser positioning laser heads" or a specific model number
like "5517C".  Some of the specifications from the datasheet:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nominal vacuum wavelength:</b> 632.991372 nm (5501B, 5517A/B),
 632.991354 nm (5517C/D).
<li><b>Vacuum wavelength accuracy:</b> 0.1 ppm (0.02 ppm with factory
 calibration to MIL-STD 45662).  I believe this simply means that the
 optical frequency of the laser is measured precisely and its value is
 included in a test report, NOT that the design of the laser is different.
<li><b>Vacuum wavelength stability (one hour):</b> 0.002 ppm typical.
<li><b>Vacuum wavelength stability (50,000 hour lifetime):</b> 0.02 ppm
 typical.
</ul>
<p>
These sound quite incredible but 1 ppm is a frequency of
about 474 MHz (1/1,000,000 of 474 THz, the optical frequency corresponding
to a wavelength of 633 nm).  Thus 0.1 ppm is 47.4 MHz, 0.02 ppm is 9.5 MHz
and 0.002 ppm is 0.95 MHz.  So, still impressive, but quite reasonable
for a well designed stabilized HeNe laser.  However, what is somewhat unique
about the 5517 and some of the other HP/Agilent lasers is that this
absolute accuracy is achieved without the need for any periodic testing
or adjustments, by virtue of the design of the mode sampling and locking
electronics.
<p>
With respect to selecting among the various laser models, if your application
has no need for the higher REF frequency (often called the split
frequency), there is no advantage to getting
a laser like a 5517D as opposed to a 5517B.  In fact, the lasers with a
lower REF frequency tend to have higher output power and thus may be easier
to set up and align especially in multiple-axis configurations.  They
also tend to be less expensive on the surplus market, though the Agilent
price isn't that much different.  The only
disadvantage of a laser with higher output power is that there can be enough
of a detected MEAS signal due to slight angular misalignment of
interferometer optics like the 10706A to result in a reading even if
the beam to the tool or whatever whose position or velocity is to be measured
is blocked or misaligned.  The interferometer cube contains a
polarizing beamsplitter and if the F1 and F2 orientation are not precisely
aligned with the polarizer, there will be a small amount of F1 mixed with F2
and vice-versa even without the reflection from the mirror on tool.
With a 400 &micro;W laser and single axis, the required angular
accuracy to avoid a false MEAS signal is well under 1 degree with the optical
receiver threshold at its default most sensitive setting.  And even if
the alignment is perfect, polarizing beam splitter and AR coatings
are not perfect so there can still be residual mixing.  None of this matters
once the return beam is aligned since the MEAS signal will be much stronger
than the bogus one, but it can be confusing.  Increasing the threshold
may be desirable to avoid the issue.
<p>
And a note about that impressive spec'd lifetime of 50,000 hours - about
6-1/4 years of continuous use.  HP lasers used to last a long long time and
it wasn't unusual to find an HP laser running fine after 8 years.  But I
rather suspect this is no longer the case.  I've seen many late model
(2004 to 2006) Agilent 5517s that were going down hill well before 6
years including at least one that was essentially dead after less than
3 years.  These were standard 5517Bs or 5517Cs pulled from semiconductor
fabs, either because they failed in normal use, or because they were rejected
during preventive maintenance due to low power or the REF frequency
going out of spec (which is usually related to the power decline).  Thus,
even a late manufacturing date is no longer assurance of a healthy laser.
Nor would even a close inspection of the HeNe laser tube, as the they
appear identical except for the Agilent label - perhaps that's enough!
So if you are buying these things new, it probably pays to go for the
extended warranty. :)

<h4><A NAME="hsthppoo">HP/Agilent Laser Principles of Operation</A></h4>

All the HP laser heads use what is called an axial Zeeman-split HeNe
laser, which produces two orthogonally polarized modes differing in frequency
by between 1.5 and 4 MHz.  The beam is single spatial mode (TEM00) though
the outer tail may be clipped by the beam expander.  The two polarized
modes are actually a pair of lasing lines operating on the same longitudinal
mode of the laser cavity but slightly shifted due to the Zeeman effect
resulting from the laser tube operating inside an axial
magnetic field.  However, it's not strictly accurate to think of the
longitudinal mode oscillating on its own and then somehow being split
into two sub-modes by the magnetic field.  Rather, it is the Doppler-broadened
neon gain curve itself that splits and the two halves are actually separated
by 100s of Mhz.  Lasing on one of these gain curves will result in right-hand
circular polarization and lasing on the other will result in leff-hand circular
polarization.  Then, any given longitudinal mode will see some amount
of gain from each of the split gain curves, and if above threshold, will
lase there.  This means that the location where the two Zeeman split
modes are equal in amplitude is not generally at the peak of the neon
gain curve but part way down as shown in
<A HREF="zeemode1.gif">Axial Zeeman Split HeNe Laser Mode Behavior</A>,
a simplified diagram like one probably found in a textbook.
(More below.)  Note that while the cavity may be long enough for more than one
longitudinal mode to be present (as in the diagram), only the
main pair will have both modes lasing and thus be able to create a
beat signal in the frequency range that matters (a few MHz rather
than many 100s of MHz).  In addition, in geniune HP/Agilent lasers,
conditions are such that <i>only</i> the main modes can oscillate
(no "rogue" modes).  Rogue modes can potentially result in problems
in the interferometer.
<p>
Waveplates at the output of the HeNe laser tube convert the left and
right-hand circularly polarized Zeeman split modes to linearly polarized
modes that are orthogonal and aligned with the horixontal and vertical
axes of the laser.  These two modes usually differ in optical frequency
by between 1.5 and 4 Mhz (depending on the specific laser).  (Some recent
versions of the 5517 may actually go to 6 MHz or more.)  The X and Y
polarizations are sent down different paths in the metrology application.
One is generally a reference length and the other is the distance to be
measured or tracked.  (It's the change in path length difference
that matters so they could both move if desired.)  The two beams
rather than creating an interference pattern are beat together in
a detector that outputs a difference (or heterodyne) signal.  If the
relative distance between the two beam paths changes by one half
wavelength of the laser (about 632.8 nm but accurate to many significant
digits!), the phase of the difference signal will change by 360 degrees.
The laser also generates an electrical signal from beating the
signals together internally.  This constant reference is compared
to the detector signal and an electronics package counts off the
phase shifts and uses it to determine the distance traveled.
<p>
A moderately powerful cylindrical permanent magnet does the
Zeeman splitting resulting in a pair of circularly polarized outputs at
two very slightly different frequencies.  F1 is designated the lower
frequency and F2 is designated the higher frequency.
For the 5501A/B,  F1 is vertical (perpenticular to laser base) while 
F2 is horizontal (parallel to laser base).  For the 5517A/B/C/D, 5518A,
and 5519A/B, F1 is horizontal (parallel to laser base) while
F2 is vertical (perpendicular to laser base).  (Exactly why HP switched
orientations between the two model series is not clear as there is no
benefit to one over the other and it just causes confusion.)  The
difference F1 and F2 is between 1.5 and 4 MHz depending on the model
(as listed above) and also the specific sample of the laser.  The
distance between the mirrors in the 5501B and all later lasers
like the various 5517s is feedback controlled by a heating coil
wrapped around the bore inside the tube to force the cavity
to maintain the position of the lasing lines symmetric on the Zeeman split
neon gain curves as shown in <A HREF="zeemode1.gif">Axial Zeeman Split HeNe
Laser Mode Behavior</A>.  A 1/4 waveplate converts
the circular polarized output to orthogonal horizontal and vertical polarized
components which are used externally. F1 is reflected from the thing being
measured or tested (e.g., disk drive servo writer) and F2 is reflected from
a fixed reference.  The difference frequencies (F1-F2) and (F1-F2)+dF1 are then
analyzed to determine precise position, velocity, or whatever.  This approach
has lower noise, greater stability, and is therefore more accurate than the
common single frequency interferometer.  By using cavity length control to
lock the difference frequency to a known reference, the actual optical
wavelength/frequency can be set very accurately.  Using the MHz range beat
signals makes signal processing straightforward and is more immune to noise
than the baseband optical signals.
<p>
Interestingly, the actual beat or reference frequency does NOT need to be
super stable over the long term.  Rather, it is the difference
between the reference and the return signals that matters and that only depends
on the motion of the target reflector, the optical frequency of the
meausrement beam, and the speed of light.  Thus, although the optical
frequency needs to be known to high precision (+/-0.1 ppm for the standard
lasers; +/-0.02 ppm for those calibrated to MIL STD-45662), the
exact beat frequency of each laser is not precisely controlled or even
precisely measured and recorded or used anywhere in the calculations.
This is one reason why the listings above include only a range of values.
Any given sample will operate somewhere within that range but the exact
value is somewhat random depending on the specific characteristics of
the tube/magnet assembly, and to a lesser extent, the specific place
on the neon gain curve that the lasing line is parked.  However, the
beat frequency will be relatively constant over the life of the laser.
While one might think that locking the difference frequency to
a crystal reference would be even better - and the technique is
patented - it's not clear that this would be better and might actually be
worse.  The difference frequency relative to the mode position
can change for any number of reasons.  But forcing the amplitude of
the two modes to be equal as is done in the HP lasers centers the
modes on the split neon gain curves, which should be very stable
in terms of wavelength.
<p>
All of the HP lasers use conventional dual polarization mode stabilization
to lock the lasing lines to the split neon gain curve.  However, the two
signals are not from adjacent longitudinal modes as with most common laboratory
stabilized HeNe lasers, but are the two Zeeman split sub-modes differing
in frequency by a few MHz instead of many 100s of MHz.  In fact, both
are the same cavity mode but shifted slightly higher and lower than
would be predicted by c/2*L.  One twist on the
implementation is that the 5501B and those below it on the chart use a
Liquid Crystal Device (LCD) polarization rotator to alternately sample the
horizontal and vertical polarized modes, and subtracting sample-and-hold
to compare them in the error amp driving the heater, rather than the polarizing
beamsplitter and dual photodiodes used in many other dual polarization
mode stabilized lasers including the 5500C and 5501A.  The LCD approach
does have a sort of elegance as well as practical benefits.  Since the
same optical path and photodiode is used for both polarization modes,
the sensitivity is identical so the mode balance should be perfect
assuming the LCD polarization rotation is 90 degrees.  Since the intent is
to park the modes symmetrically on the split neon gain curve,
this is perfect and thus requires no offset adjustment over the life
of the laser as the output power of the tube declines.  And,
the LCD and associated electronics may in fact be cheaper
than a high quality polarizing beam splitter.  However, it also
creates some artifacts as a result of the digital switching, resulting
in small cyclical variations in optical frequency over a period of
2 or 3 seconds.  These are of no consequence for most metrology applications,
but do detract from the elegance of these lasers.
<p>
In fact, the thermally tuned lasers have only one adjustment associated
with stabilization, and that is for the temperature setpoint at which the
controller switches from pre-heating to optical locking.  The resistance
change of the actual heater coil is used to sense temperature and there
may apparently be variation from one tube to the next.  But this is an
extremely non-critical setting and won't affect accuracy, only possibly
the temperature range over which the laser will remain locked.  (5517s
with the Newest Digital Control PCB may have no adjustments, or at least
none that are obvious!)
<p>
One oddity with respect to the thermally tuned laser tubes is the patent
reference that appears on the label of all newer ones at least:
"Licensed by Patlex Corporation Under Patent No, 4,704,583".  The
title of this patent is: "Light Amplifiers Employing Collisions to
Produce a Population Inversion", filed in 1977 but not granted until
November of 1987.  The most curious thing is that there appears to be
very little of relevance in the patent other than its association with
laser action!  Nothing in the patent diagrams or
text has any obvious connection to the tube assembly design.  In fact, the
exact same text exists on other more mundane things like a Carl Zeiss-badged
Siemens LGK 7634, a bog standard 2 mW random polarized HeNe laser head.
I've heard that Patlex is actually a bunch of lawyers and I bet they
made out or are making out quite well. :)

<h4><A NAME="hatsazlb">Speculation on Axial Zeeman HeNe Laser Behavior</A></h4>

I've yet to see an explanation of the axial Zeeman
effect that isn't either total hand waving or pages of hairy math!
I can hand-wave with the best of them, but would welcome something
more satisfying. :)  All fundamental physical phenomena have
fundamentally simple explanations that at least capture the spirit,
if not all the details).  (OK, well, except perhaps for
high energy physics where hypothetical particles and extra dimensions
are created at the pleasure of high energy physicists who need to attract
equally high energy grant money.)
I'll even accept that an axial magnetic field splits
the neon gain curve and results in the separate shifted gain curves
for left and right circularly polarized modes.  But why do the two
lasing lines move apart?
<p>
There are two possible "simple" causes of the lasing frequency shifts
resulting from Zeeman splitting:
Mode pulling (which tends to attract each lasing
mode towards its respective gain center) and magnetically-induced
birefringence of the plasma (which results in the effective cavity length
differing for each lasing mode's polarization).  Normal mode pulling seems
unlikely as its effect in a HeNe laser is typically in the 10s of kHz range
at most, 2 orders of magnitude lower than the MHz difference frequency present
with these lasers.  So, that would leave birefringence, but birefringence
effects are even worse at predicting some of the observed behavior.
For example, why does cavity loss affect split frequency so dramatically?
<p>
The following explanation may be totally bogus but it has the attractive
property that using some not-so-hairy math, it is able to predict the
approximate behavior of real Zeeman lasers.  So here goes:
<p>
The mechanism for the shift of the Zeeman modes away from the cavity
modes <i>is</i> a type of mode pulling.  Normal mode pulling is a form of
mode competition where two or more lasing modes are competing for the
same population of excited particles.  The lasing modes will then tend to be
attracted slightly toward the center of the gain bandwidth curve.  This will be
true in a solid state laser where the gain is homogeneously broadened
- all atoms are in the same environment since they are fixed in a
solid, usually a crystal lattice.  The only time it will be true with
a HeNe laser with a Fabry-Perot cavity is where modes are equally
positioned on opposite sides of the Doppler-broadened neon gain curve.
Since the Doppler broadening is due to motion, photons traveling one
way will stimulate excited atoms on one side of the gain curve and
photons of the same frequency traveling in the opposite direction will
stimulate excited atoms on the opposite side of the gain curve.  Even
though the Zeeman-split modes are shifted in frequency with respect to
each-other, they satisfy this condition when they are near the center
of the split gain curves - which is the normal locked position.
<p>
The basic mode pulling equation (with gobs of assumptions!) is:
<p>
<PRE>
                     GB
  FS = FSR * (1 - ---------)
                   GB + CB
</PRE>
<p>
Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>FS (Frequency Shift)</b> is the maximum change in lasing frequency for
 one mode with respect to another adjacent mode.
<li><b>FSR (Free Spectral Range)</b> is the longitudinal mode spacing of
 the FP cavity equal to c/2L.
<li><b>GB (Gain Bandwidth)</b> is the FWHM of the lasing medium gain profile.
<li><b>CB (Cavity Bandwidth)</b> is the FWHM of the FP cavity passband with
 no excitation (also known as the cold cavity linewidth).
</ul>
<p>
CB will be equal to FSR/Finesse where for high-R mirrors with equal
reflectivity, Finesse = pi*sqrt(R)/(1-R).  For the types of mirrors
in HeNe lasers with R close to 1, a good enough approximation will
be 3/(1-R).  Where one of the mirrors is HR as is the case with HeNe
lasers, this will then be near 6/(1-R).
<p>
There should probably be a factor of 2 thrown in since what we're
interested in is not the shift of a single mode, but the change in distance
between the two modes due to both of them shifting by the same amount in
opposite directions.  However, this can arguably be offset by the fact
that the modes are positioned about half way down the gain curves, not
far down where the mode pulling effect would be greatest.  So, accept
that this hand waving cancels out. :)
<p>
The HP-5517 laser tubes have a 127 mm (5 inch) cavity corresponding to
an FSR of about 1.2 GHz.  We assume the neon (Doppler-broadened) GB to
be 1.6 GHz.  Plugging in some numbers:
<p>
<PRE>
                                 1.6 GHz
   FS = 1.2 GHz * (1 - ---------------------------
                        1.6 GHz + 1.2 GHz/Finesse
</PRE>
<p>
Here are 2 lasers with OC mirrors with reflectivity that has been measured
(dissected barcode scanner tube and 5517B tube) and several others where
the reflectivities can be estimated based on difference frequency
specifications (5517A/C/D):
<p>
<PRE>
   OC Mirror   Cavity     F2-F1       F2-F1
  Reflectance  Finesse  Predicted     Range     Tube type
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     99.0%       600     1.5 MHz   1.2-1.6 MHz  Barcode Scanner
     98.75%      500     1.8 MHz   1.5-2.0 MHz  HP-5517A
     98.5%       400     2.24 MHz  1.9-2.4 MHz  HP-5517B
     98.0%       300     3.0 MHz   3.0-3.4 MHz  HP-5517C
     97.5%       200     3.7 MHz   3.4-4.0 MHz  HP-5517D
</PRE>
<p>
OK, so I kind of picked the reflectivities for the 5517A/C/D mirrors to
make the results reasonable.  With the increasing cavity loss,
the output power of lasers with higher REF frequencies will tend to be
lower.  However 97.5% may simply be too low to lase at all or with
useful power on a tube of this length.  Eventually, I will measure
5517A, 5517C, and 5517D OCs.  But I don't have any tubes that  I'm
willing to take to bits at the present time, partially due to (1) the physical
and emotional trauma that would result and (2) the fact that I haven't located
the special chants and incantations required for metrology laser tube
sacrifice. :)  If anyone has done this, has certifiable 5517A/C/D tube bits,
or has a 5517 tube that's already cracked or broken they'd be willing to
contribute to the cause, please contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
This approach also predicts that the shift and thus beat frequency
will be a maximum with the modes centered as they are when locked.
Of course, all these nice results based on numerous assumptions
may be wishful coincidence, but they are close to what is observed
and don't require delving into esoteric plasma physics.  Whew! :)
<p>
Now back to your regularly scheduled programming. :)

<h4><A NAME="hstnwhah">Notes on the Waveplates in HP/Agilent HeNe Laser Tube Assemblies</A></h4>

When two-frequency Zeeman lasers are discussed in textbooks and research
papers, it is generally stated that the magnetic field splits the original
mode into two modes that are left and right circularly polarized.  Period.
However, if this were true, a 1/4 waveplate alone would be sufficient to
both convert them to orthogonal linear polarized modes and to align them
with the X and Y axes of the laser as required for use in an interferometer.
The reason is that a 1/4 waveplate takes a left-hand circular polarized
input and produces a linear polarized output at +45&deg; with respect
to its fast axis, and takes a right-hand circular polarized
input and produces a linear polarized output at -45&deg; with respect
to its fast axis.  The input orientation doesn't matter.  So, the 1/4
waveplate could be oriented to align the output linear polarizations
without regard to the input.
<p>
But HP lasers from day 1 (the original 5500A around 1969 even
before it had an official model number) and Agilent lasers to the present
have <i>all</i> had both 1/4 and 1/2 waveplates with the basic design
unchanged over more than 40 years.  Further, both waveplates are in
mounts that allow the tilt of each one to be
adjusted around one of its principle axes.  Why?  Some possibilities
as to the reasons for this more complex setup are as follows:
<p>
Real HeNe laser tubes exhibit some small random amount of birefringence both
from the fine structure of the mirror coatings as well as from unavoidable
geometric asymmetry in their construction.  Without a magnetic
field or explicit polarization control measures such as a Brewster window or
plate, these tend to lock the polarization of the longitudinal modes to
a fixed orientation about the tubes optical axis, and 90 degrees from it.
Adjacent modes will almost always be orthogonally polarized.  In a HeNe
laser with an axial magnetic field such as one from HP/Agilent,
this will result in the Zeeman modes being slightly (or not so
slightly) elliptically polarized rather than pure circularly polarized.
So, the orientation of the 1/4 waveplate will matter and only certain
orientations (2 or 4) will convert these to orthogonal linearly polarized
modes.  But the resulting linealry polarized modes in general won't be aligned
with the system's X and Y axes, so the 1/2 waveplate is then required to
rotate them to match.  (The magnetic field will also
never be perfectly symmetric or uniform, though I don't know whether this
is ever a significant factor in affecting the mode polarization.)
<p>
The adjustable tilt allows the exact retardation of each waveplate
to be altered slightly.  I find it somewhat hard to believe that the reason is
simply to be able to use cheapo waveplates that might not always be exactly
1/4 or 1/2 wave!  However, this explanation can't be entirely discounted since
the accuracy of the retardaion is critical to producing F1 and F2 modes
that are purely linear and precisely orthogonally as required for the
metrology applications.  And, the waveplates are made from what looks
like optical-grade mica whose discrete layers preclude the ability to
select the exact retardation by controlling thickness.
And whether mica waveplates were originally selected based on low cost or zero
order or temperature stability or being very thin to avoid significantly
shifting the beam when tilted or being what the designers had laying
around is not known either.  But there might be another reason for this
"feature" - namely to further compensate for
some deficiency in the modes coming out of the tube, again related to
deviation from being purely circular.  Or something. ;)
<p>
Thus, there are in fact 4 degrees of freedom, though clearly the tilt has a
much smaller effect than the rotation.  And without a full understanding
(possibly including hairy math!), it's difficult to really come up with
an adjustment procedure that will work in general.  That's the bad news.
<p>
The good news is that from experience, swapping the entire waveplate assembly
between HP/Agilent tubes is likely to result in acceptable performance without
any adjustments other than making sure that the overall orientation is the
same.  Therefore, it would appear that these errors are usually small.  But
it does seem that it is sometimes necessary to touch up the tilt of the
1/4 waveplate in order to produce the best mode purity in addition to
optimizing the waveplate orientations.  Adjusting a waveplate assembly from
scratch (random orientation and tilt) may be much more challenging though
since it would first be necessary to match the orientations of each
of the waveplates to a waveplate assembly to at least allow the laser
to lock.  Without a stable output, going further would be virtually
impossible.
<p>
So much for hand waving. :-)  One might think that a good source for
information relating to Hewlett Packard's metrology laser technology
would be patents.  But so far, patent searches have turned up almost nothing
of relevance.  If anyone has knowledge or references related
to the waveplate issue or anything else of relevance, please contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
The only actual waveplate fine tuning procedure to maximize the F1/F2
separation and achieve optimal orientation I've ever seen for one of
the early HP-5500 lasers with built-in interferometer optics.  The goal
then is to minimize any return of the component that is supposed to
be transmitted.  It simply says something like:
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Rotate the 1/2 waveplate to get a minimum reading."
<li>"Rotate the 1/4 waveplate to get a minimum reading."
<li>"The outer plate (tilt) may need to be rotated to get a minimum reading."
<li>"Repeat all three adjustments to obtain a minimum reading."
</ul>
<p>
But there is no explanation as to why this procedure is the way it is.
And they don't mention the tilt adjustment on the 1/2 waveplate for
some reason.
<p>
I did tests of WavePlate (WP) sets from three HP-5517 lasers using a linearly
polarized HeNe laser.  The results are as follows:
<p>
<PRE>
                     <--------- Orientation ---------->
    ID#    Laser     Input    1/4 WP    1/2 WP   Output
 ---------------------------------------------------------
     1   5517C 9mm    +20&deg;     +20&deg;     +32.5&deg;    +45&deg;
     2   5517B 6mm    -20&deg;     -20&deg;     +12.5&deg;    +45&deg;
     3   5517B 6mm    +20&deg;     +20&deg;     +32.5&deg;    +45&deg;
</PRE>
<p>
(I doubt that the specific type of 5517 laser or its beam diameter makes any
difference.  The accuracy of my measurements on orientation is within +/-2&deg;
for input and +/-1&deg; for output, though the latter at +45&deg; is
probably quite precise based on theory.)
<p>
The Input is the orientation required for the polarized HeNe laser to produce
a pure linearly polarized beam at the output of the WPs, and thus also of the
orientation of the optical axes of the 1/4 WP.  (Only if aligned with the slow
or fast axis of a 1/4 WP will the polarization remain linear, a requirement
for these tests.)  As expected, the output orientation is the same in all
cases since the desired output will be rotated by 45&deg; to align with
the X and Y axes.  This is a result of the conversion from circular to linear
polarization by the 1/4 WP, at 45&deg; with respect to its optical
axes.  The orientation of the 1/2 WP
was inferred from the transfer function from input to output.
Now, it's quite possible that the orientation of the 1/4 WP
was chosen at random and not actually determined for the specific tube
unless it was found that the adjusting the 1/2 WP alone would not meet
specifications.  However, I have found that it may be necessary to
iteratively tweak the 1/4 WP and 1/2 WP to achieve best purety of the
F1/F2 modes - the same result could not be obtained by adjusting only
the 1/2 WP.  Indeed, with a genuine original HP/Agilent tube that has
its WPs optimally adjusted, the purety of the F1/F2 modes is nearly
perfect.  So, perhaps they start at 0&deg; (or +/-20&deg!) for the
1/4 WP orientation and go from there.
<p>
With the Zeeman tube producing a pure two-frequency left and right circularly
polarized beam, all of these WP assemblies would result in pure orthogonal
linearly polarized outputs oriented along the X and Y axes.  This was
confirmed by placing another 1/4 waveplate in the linearly polarized HeNe
laser's beam at 45 degrees to produce pure left and right circularly
polarized inputs to the WPs.  The results were linearly polarized
outputs oriented along X and Y.  In neither WP assembly, was there
any indication that the tilt of either WP was adjusted for other
than pure 1/4 or 1/2 wave as the extinction when set for optimal
linearly polarized outputs was nearly perfect.
<p>
Experiments with common barcode scanner HeNe laser tubes inside
strong magnetic fields have also shown similar characteristics.  With
these as well, the beat frequency would come and go as the tube heated
and expanded with this effect becoming more pronounced when the magnetic
field encompassed the entire tube as it does with the HP lasers.
<p>
I also did some tests with and without the presence of the
waveplates from an HP laser.
Without waveplates, there was absolutely no indication of a
polarization preference in the output beam at any time indicating
pure circular polarization.  When the
optics were installed and aligned to the original blue paint, the
symmetry of the beat waveform, if nothing else, was polarization
dependent. In addition, just after the output beat appeared as well as
just before it disappeared, the polarizer would suppress the beat
entirely when oriented so that its axis was parallel or at 90 degrees
to the axis defined by the blue paint. These perhaps weren't quite as
dramatic as the effects I was hoping for but confirmed some of the
speculation at least.

<p>
I'm not sure what accounts for the two different wavelengths (and thus
optical frequencies) among these lasers.  There are no obvious
physical differences to account for it.  The tubes, beam samplers,
and relevant portions of the control electronics are all identical.
So, it's possible there was a change in isotopic gas-fill or pressure
or something else between 5517A/5517B/5518A/5501B lasers and those that came
after them.  The difference of approximately 12 MHz is still way
lower than the commercial-grade error spec of +/-0.1 ppm (roughly
+/-47 MHz), so it really doesn't matter.  For the Military-grade lasers,
the exact optical frequency is measured and included in the
calibration report.  But a report for one laser I saw had the
optical frequency over 10 MHz away from the spec'd value anyhow.
My contact at NIST doesn't even know whether it's an actual change
in optical frequency or simply an upgrade to the calibration
in the measurement electronics!
<p>
I've compared the optical frequency of multiple 5517 and 5501B lasers
and have found no evidence of any real difference, let alone one
averaging 12 MHz as shown in the specifications above.  Here are

<A HREF="tfiltst3.gif">Diagram of Test Setup for HP/Agilent Laser Optical
Frequency Comparison</A> shows the way these measurements were made.
<A HREF="tfiltst3.jpg">Photo of Test Setup for HP/Agilent Laser Optical
Frequency Comparison</A> shows how ugly it really is, but the scope on
the right is displaying the actual beat signal of a pair of 5517Bs.
For later measurements, two external HeNe laser power supplies (the white
boxes and the Variac) were added to eliminate the FM introduced by the
switching noise/ripple of the internal HeNe laser power supplies, but
they weren't used for these tests and wouldn't have affected the
results since the high frequency FM would be averaged out.
<p>
The 5517 lasers were enclosed in standard cases (non-vented for all except
the 5517E) and allowed to reach equilibrium (2 hours minimum).  (Removing
the cover may significantly change the optical frequency once equilibrium
is reached.)  The lasers in the photo don't have any cloths on, but, well,
that's another matter! :)  The 5501As were run naked so that the "Photodiode
Offset" adjustment could be performed.  (More below.)  It might be best to
do this via a hole in the cover as they do drift significantly with the
cover in place.  But I wasn't *that* enthusiastic!
<p>
Laser 3, the first and healthiest 5501B to be tested,
was chosen arbitrarily to be the reference for optical frequency.
The Balanced Frequency Difference is the frequency of the mid-point
between F1 and F2 for the subject (ID) laser minus the frequency of
the mid-point between F1 and F2 for Laser 3. There's still a +/-1 MHz
or more uncertainty due to variations in the specific
lock point of the two lasers being compared during any given run.
<p>
The three 5501As are very well used and weak, but it was easy to obtain
a beat between them and the 5517A, Laser 10 (which happened to be the
5517 laser tested and thus conveniently left in place!).  5501As have a
"Photodiode Offset" adjustment, which moves the lasing line on the split gain
curve.  It's the square pot (R4) on the Lock Reference PCB, clockwise rotation
decreases optical frequency.  I could have set them all to have a 0 MHz
difference frequency, but this would have resulted in grossly unbalanced
mode amplitudes for these high mileage lasers.  So, they were adjusted
according to the HP procedure - maximizing the F1-F2 REF frequency, which
centers the lasing line between the split neon gain curve.  Before doing
this, it wasn't even possible to see the difference frequency with Laser 13
likely because it was too high for my instrumentation.  This was probably
because parts of Laser 13 had been swapped, including the tube, without
making any adjustments.  The Photodiode Offset adjustments on the other
2 5501As were quite close to optimal.  However, this is a single turn
pot which adjusts the mode ratio from 1:2 to 3:2, and thus the optical
frequency varies significantly with very small changes
in its position - possibly 50 MHz or more end-to-end.  Going only by
the REF frequency - which isn't perfectly stable - it's quite likely that
there will be an uncertainty of 5 or 10 MHz.  So, best would be to
adjust this pot (make it a 10 turn pot!) through a hole in the cover
after the laser has reached thermal equilibrium.  And if what you want
is a precise optical frequency and don't mind some possible mode
imbalance, adjust it with respect to a reference laser like an iodine
stabilized HeNe laser instead of for maximum REF frequency! :)  And,
although the optical frequency changes with the cover installed, the
Photodiode Offset adjustment could still be optimal if the change is
due to the tube temperature, and thus the gas pressure increasing.
That would still maintain the same mode balance.
<p>
Laser #17 was rebuilt by a company other than HP/Agilent.  (I'm not at liberty
to reveal the company name.)  It is believed to have had its original laser
tube removed from the magnet/optics assembly and replaced with a laser tube
that is not from Agilent.  This explains the large offset in optical
frequency, which could result from any number of factors.  (See below.)
The offset is probably of little practical consequence as long as it
remains relatively constant.
<p>
Aside from laser #17, based on these data, there is really no consistent
difference in average optical frequency based on laser type and if anything,
it goes the wrong way!  And note the change resulting from the swap of the
beam sampler.  Beam Sampler 1 was originally on Laser 2 and was resulting
in the optical frequency dancing around, then swapped with Beam Sampler 2
which resulted in a large frequency offset, then with a third Beam Sampler
which was finally well behaved and now remains in that laser.  I have no
reason to suspect anything is wrong with either Beam Sampler 1 or 2 and did
test them for basic functionality with a voltage source and polarizer.  All
beam sampler assemblies I've checked regardless of what laser
they came from have exactly the same part number though it's
possible that the optics inside differ in some subtle way
depending on laser type.  There are at least two versions of the housing -
one with a small aperture for 6 mm optics and another with a large aperture
for 9 mm optics, but beyond that I don't know of any differences.  Lasers 3
through 7 definitely have their
original beam samplers.  Though I don't have minimum specs for the 5517E,
Laser 4 is probably relatively high mileage.  And lasers 5 and 9 are
high mileage as evidenced by their low (below spec) output power.
Even though the output power of Lasers 6, 7, and 8 is well within spec,
they are also definitely high mileage lasers being extremely slow start
and unable to run on the normal 3.5 mA discharge current.
This in itself shouldn't have a large effect on optical frequency
unless the tube actually runs hotter (in which case the optical
frequency should <i>increase</i>, more below).  But the lock point
temperature adjustment has not been changed on these lasers, so
the equilibrium bore temperature should be similar to that of the
others though the equilibrium laser tube envelope and laser temperature
will be slightly higher.
<p>
So, the actual optical frequency may be dominated by the amount of
use (number of hours on the tube) which also tends to correlate with
a decline in output power.  This may overwhelm any real or fictitious
optical frequency offset found in the specifications.  While I
don't know what the original output power was for most of these lasers,
those with 400 &micro;W or more start very quickly or instantly and are likely
relatively young (usage-wise).  Laser 1 is known to have been taken out of
service due to a bad LCD in the beam sampler, so it could have seen
relatively little use.
<p>
There has been research showing
that the neon gain center frequency tends to decline with use due to
a drop in tube pressure and other factors.  Helium has an effect on
lasing center frequency of about +22 MHz/Torr, so a loss of He due to
gas entrapment on the tube walls or cathode, leading to a drop in
its partial pressure, can easily account for these large frequency
differences.  (Loss of He due to diffusion through the tube walls
would also result in a decline in its partial pressure, but this
loss mechanism should be minimal.)  Major factors include:
<p>
<PRE>
      Cause             Sensitivity       Comments    
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Helium Pressure      +22 MHz/Torr       Pressure of He decreases with use
  Neon Pressure        -25 MHz/Torr       Pressure of Ne decreases with use
  Neon Isotopic Ratio  +10 MHz/% of <sup>22</sup>Ne   Ratio of <sup>22</sup>Ne:<sup>20</sup>Ne Decreases with use
  Temperature          +280 kHz/&deg;C        Affected by specific lock point
</PRE>
<p>
Both He and Ne partial pressures descrease over the life of the tube but
because the fill ratio is between 5:1 to 9:1 of He:Ne, the decrease in
He pressure dominates and a frequency drift downward of several MHz/year is
quite reasonable.  If not filled with a pure Ne isotope, the Ne isotope
ratio also will change slightly as the
<sup>22</sup>Ne will be trapped at a slightly a higher rate than
<sup>20</sup>Ne.  Note the strong dependence on the Ne isotope ratio,
a 1 GHz range!  So, just over a 1 percent change in the ratio at the time of
manufacture could account for the 12 MHz difference in nominal frequency
specifications.  And, for any given measurement, there is uncertainty
in the actual lock point as the laser warms up but that's probably only
a maximum of +/-1 MHz or so.  The 280 kHz/&deg;C is for a tube about
8-1/2 inches long - similar in length to most of the HP/Agilent tubes.
However, note that for the HP/Agilent lasers, the temperature of the
tube envelope is not controlled, only the mirror spacing rod for the
5501B and 5517s, and not at all for the 5501A.  So, the temperature
of the interior of the laser may have a significant impact on the optical
frequency.  This differs from many other stabilized HeNe lasers where
a large portion of the tube is wrapped in a heater.
<p>
The above has been distilled from the paper:
"Frequency stability measurements on polarization-stabilized
He-Ne lasers", T. M. Niebauer, James E. Faller, H. M. Godwin, John L. Hall,
and R. L. Barger, Applied Optics, vol. 27, no. 7, 1 April 1988, pp. 1285-1289.<p>
So, it's quite possible that any differences in the optical frequency of
these lasers when they were new is totally swamped by changes due to use.
For example, if a laser has been run 24/7 for 3 years (middle age for these
lasers!), its optical frequency could have gone down by 10 to 15 MHz due to
the decline in gas pressure and isotope ratio changes.  But the ultimate
conclusions may be that (1) it's not worthwhile to assume anything about
the nominal optical frequency on used HP/Agilent lasers, but if the optical
frequency can be measured (or compared to that of a new laser), (2) the
frequency shift may be a means of estimating how many hours or years they've
been on! :-)
<p>
Despite all these potential source of variability,
for an application requiring an accurate stable optical frequency reference
like calibration of a wavementer, a healthy 5517 laser (any version) is
probably a better choice than a laboratory stabilized HeNe laser like a
Spectra-Physics 117A.  The reason is that the design of the 5517
inherently locks to a balanced mode state, with no adjustments and little
in the electronics to drift with age to change this.  Lasers like the
SP-117A have separate photodiodes and pre-amps for the two mode signals
as well internal adjustments that can affect the lock point.  Furthermore, the
optical frequency specifications of all HP/Agilent lasers are known (even if
there is an unexplained discrepancy of 12 MHz going from the 5517B to 5517C).
This is not the case for many other stabilized HeNe lasers.  And,
if needed, the laser can easily be packed up and sent to NIST or elsewhere
to have its optical frequency measured precisely without fear of it changing
either from a few bumps during shipment, or over time if turned on
periodically rather being run 24/7.  I wouldn't recommend other HP lasers
like the 5501B simply because healthy ones are becoming
harder and harder to find.  And the 5501A uses a different locking
design which is similar to that of the other (non-HP/Agilent) lasers.
However, a healthy 5518A or 5519A/B would also be suitable, using the
same design as the 5517.

<h4><A NAME="hstoile">Obtaining an Interferometry Laser for Experimentation</A></h4>

While most people on this planet at least
would consider an HP/Agilent laser most useful as a
door-stop, there are reasons to want one other than for use in your private
semiconductor foundry or custom optics diamond turning machine. :)
In addition to their intended metrology applications, these lasers are
also ideal as laboratory stabilized HeNe lasers and optical reference lasers.
They could certainly substitute for lasers like the Coherent 200 and
Spectra-Physics 117/A if one of the frequency components is blocked
with a polarizer and the generally lower output power is adequate.
Since the optical wavelength/frequency of the HP/Agilent 5517 laser (all
versions) is known and very stable over time, they can be used for wavemeter,
spectrometer, and optical spectrum analyzer calibration.  If ultimate
accuracy is needed, the laser can be heterodyned
with an iodine-stabilized HeNe laser.  Since the HP/Agilent lasers do not
drift much even over years if not run 24/7, such a laser will stand in
for the even more expensive iodine-stabilized laser without being tied to
one.  The split frequency is also handy for testing ultra-high finesse
interferometers (another thing everyone needs!)  And, it would also be
possible to use one of these lasers as the basis for a seismometer
or the ultimate laser microphone. :)
<p>
So, if you're salivating for an HP/Agilent laser and can't live without one,
they cost somewhere between $8,000 and $12,000 new depending on options!
Used (or "previously owned" - which would be classier!) HP/Agilent lasers
can be had much cheaper but caveat
emptor.  The only ones most people can afford for personal use would be found
on eBay.  But most of these lasers that end up being resold are taken out of
service because they have an end-of-life tube.  Interferometry lasers used for
metrology are often run 24/7 from the day they are installed until they
die.  Even though the lifetime of the special HeNe laser tubes used
in these lasers may be 50,000 hours, that's still only about 6-1/4 years.
And guess where they then end up? :) If the seller hasn't powered the
laser head (or doesn't admit to it) and lists the laser "as-is" with no
returns, chances are excellent that it will serve as a nice door stop
but not much else, at least not without some effort.
Unfortunately, except for the 5519A which plugs into a standard wall socket,
these lasers require +/-15 VDC for power with a Military-style connector
that you won't find at Radio Shack.
It's easy to "hot wire" power from inside, but unless the seller is familiar
with this sort of thing or has the mating power supply and cable, it may be
better to just get a DOA warranty in writing and accept that you may have
to pay shipping both ways if the laser is only good as a door stop.
<p>
These lasers also show up at surplus dealers but they tend to ask higher
prices than would be considered acceptable for basic tinkering and many
seem content to simply have the laser gathering dust than to let it go for
a realistic price if untested.  But I've also heard of at least one instance
where such a laser was found at a garage sale.  That price was almost certainly
right!
<p>
Also, note that when looking for lasers like this on eBay or elsewhere,
the clothes these lasers wear are of little importance.  Newer Agilent OEM
5517 lasers (which are mostly what show up as late model surplus in 2010)
tend to have a thin cheaply made gold-ish (alodined)
aluminum shroud rather than the beige or gray two piece case of most older HP
lasers.  It has a feeble attempt at a rubber gasket all around to seal it but
this really doesn't work well and only makes reassembly a royal pain.
What's inside is the same, though lasers built after the early 2000s
will likely have the newer Digital Control PCB rather than the analog Control,
PCB but they are otherwise identical and functionally equivalent.
And in the trivial triviality department, Agilent's only concession to style
seems to be in the color of the front and back plates: Beige for 5517Bs,
silver for 5517Cs, and gold for 5517Ds! :)  But this is only true of some
samples and there doesn't appear to be any way to predict which ones.
<p>
Regardless of who is selling the laser, if they are able to power it, the
three most important things to ask of them would be:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a good stable output beam that doesn't sputter, flicker, or cut
 out and restart at any time over the next few minutes?  And if so, how
 long does it take to appear?
<p>
 "Yes" and "a few seconds or less" means the HeNe laser tube and power
 supply are probably good and happy working together.  A laser that
 takes awhile to start may still be fully functional, but it can be
 annoying to wait 10 minutes for a beam, and associated equipment may
 expect the laser to be ready within a fixed amount of time.
<p>
 Note that the 5501B is the one exception where the laser tube isn't
 turned on until near the end of the locking process.  Thus a beam
 that doesn't appear immediately on the 5501B is a feature, not a bug. :)
 This was probably done in the design to minimize the DC current consumption
 during warmup to be backward compatible with the 5501A.  My preference,
 where this isn't an issue, is to bypass the transistor switch and enable
 the tube immediately as with all the other lasers.
<p> 
<li>Does the READY indicator come on and stay on (solid, not flashing) in about
 10 seconds for the 5501A; 4 minutes for most of the common 5517s, 5518A, and
 5519A/B; and 6 to 9 minutes for the 5501B?
<p>
 A "yes" answer to this question alone is usually sufficient to confirm
 proper operation with usable power for many purposes.  However,
 cold start to READY on solid may be over 10 minutes and up to 20 minutes
 for a few lasers like the 5517E, 5517FL, or 5517G, and some other 5517s
 using the Newest Digital Control PCB, but these lasers are almost
 non-existent surplus.  Any 5517 laser from before the year 2000 - which
 will be most of those found on eBay even in 2010 - should come ready in
 the typical 4 minutes.  A slightly longer time like 5 minutes is of no
 consequence, but if a pre-2000 laser takes several minutes longer, it's
 probably very low power and requires the extra time for the power to
 increase enough as the tube warms up for the laser to be convinced there
 is enough power available.  However, such a laser could still be useful.
<p>
 However, some types of data processing systems like the HP-5508A Measurement
 Display will produce a hard error if the laser takes more than 10 minutes to
 become ready.  (Power cycling the 5508A once the laser is ready will generally
 get around this even if it powers the laser, as it's likely to become ready
 much quicker once warmed up.)
<p>
<li>What is the output power once the READY indicator comes on solid?  The
 HP/Agilent specification for minimum power is 180 &micro;W for most of these
 lasers except the 5501A and 5517B, which are both 120 &micro;W.  Note that
 the locked output power is generally at or near the minimum
 of the power as it varies due to mode sweep during warmup.  So, simply
 measuring output power before then may result in an overly optimistic
 reading and may even be more than double the locked output power for a
 high mileage laser.
<p>
 For many applications, much less than spec'd minimum power is quite
 sufficient.  Even if the seller is unable to measure the output power,
 as long as READY comes on solid, it is probably at least 80 &micro;W for all
 the lasers except the 5501A, which will lock at much lower power - down to
 40 &micro;W or less.  Even this is sufficient for a single axis system.
</ol>
<p>
Where the laser passes these tests, it will probably be more than adequate
for an experimental, demo, test, educational, or research system which doesn't
have many measurement axes and isn't run continuously for years.  However,
before considering such a laser for installation in a semiconductor wafer
stepper producing next generation multi-core processors, many additional tests
would need to be performed to determine its present health and life
expectancy.  In some installations, the laser is swapped out after a
fixed number of hours, like fluorescent lamps! :)  While in others, they
are replaced at the point where they are at the hairy edge of meeting
HP/Agilent specs.  Either of these approaches makes sense where where
the cost of down time is extremely high.  So, even though they may
start instantly, run reliably, and have decent output power much
greater than the HP/Agilent minimum, if their REF frequency is found
to be at or above the range for that model laser, they may be
flagged for replacement during preventive maintenance.  (REF frequency
tends to increase with use and is related to the decline in output power.)
An example would be a 5517B outputting 500 &micro;W with a REF frequency
of 2.6 MHz.  The spec'd REF frequency range of a 5517B is 1.9 to
2.4 MHz.  Details are beyond the scope of this presentation,
but there may be a writeup in the future.  Stay tuned.
<p>
(If anyone has an HP/Agilent laser and has a record of the output power and
REF frequency when new either from measurements, the label, or
original paperwork, and what they are now, and if possible, an
estimate of how much it has been run, please contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.  This will aid in my attempt to more accurately
estimate previous use and life expectancy for these lasers.)
<p>
Even if the laser plays dead, it could just be a blown fuse or something
else that's easily repaired.  Or, it could be *really* slow start.
<p>
For details, see the section: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517p">Common
Problems with HP/Agilent 5517 Lasers</A>.<p>
<p>
And even if the HP/Agilent laser tube is certifiably dead, it is possible
to install an inexpensive barcode scanner tube in its place that results in
a usable system, at least for experimentation or demos.  This isn't for the
casual user, but if you're up to a modest challenge and have some basic
mechanical and electronic skills, see the section:

And, if you do come across one of these lasers at a garage sale, just
splurge, pay the $2 they're asking, and take the risk. :-)

<h4><A NAME="hstmmhp">Maximizing the Life of HP/Agilent Metrology Lasers</A></h4>

Although the spec'd lifetime of the special tubes used in these lasers
is around 50,000 hours or slightly over 6 years, with a sticker price of
something like $10,000, it still pays to do everything reasonable to
maximize their usable life.  (And, there is some evidence that newer
lasers typically run only 3 to 4 years before going outside Agilent
specifications.)  Many if not most semiconductor fabs and other
similar production facilities keep these lasers powered continuously regardless
of whether they are actually being used.  This may be based on the belief
that (1) they take a long time to reach the required wavelength accuracy,
(2) stuff tends to fail when powered cycled, and (3) HeNe lasers like to
be run.  None of these is particularly valid for these lasers.  But
even so, keeping them on 24/7 still may be most
cost effective where minimizing any unscheduled downtime is more critical
than replacement costs.  However, for educational institutions and general
research and development applications, there is no reason to do this.  Power
up the laser an hour or so before the system is needed and power it off
when not needed for several hours or more.  Here some comments on each
issue:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wavelength accuracy:</b> For a laser with a reasonably healthy tube,
 as soon as READY comes on solid, the wavelength will virtually always be
 within 0.02 ppm of its final value, and most will be shifted by less than
 0.01 ppm.  This is equal to or better than the spec'd stability over the
 laser's lifetime.  A change in temperature of 1 &deg;C or
 a change in pressure of 2.5 mm/Hg results in a 1 ppm change in
 wavelength - 50 times greater!  So, the heat generated by the laser may
 be a much larger factor than the actual optical frequency drift as it
 warms up!  In principle, the laser tube itself could be switched off
 and the built-in heater in lasers like the 5501B and 5517 would maintain
 approximately the same temperature
 with the same power dissipation so that the environmental impact of then
 turning the laser tube back on would be minimized.  All this may take is
 a $1 switch, though I have yet to implement this modification. :)  Where
 the laser is buried inside a machine and not readily accessible, a remotely
 controlled relay could serve the same purpose.  (I have seen photos of
 HP lasers with added switches or other modifications, so perhaps that's
 what they were for.)
<p>
<li><b>Stress from power cycling:</b> These lasers do not run Windows. :)
 So power cycling is not like rebooting a PC where anything can and will go
 wrong!  The electronics is very reliable, especially the older Analog Control
 PCBs.  Component failures are extremely rare and with the exception of two
 aluminum electrolytic capacitors that may dry up after 20 years and
 require replacing, a quarter century old laser should perform essentially
 the same as a new one.  (And those capacitors dry up faster when the laser
 is on and hot!)  I've heard that some machines even keep the laser running
 when the rest of the system is turned off.  This is even sillier -
 something else in the complex system is more likely to fail when power
 cycled than the laser!
<p>
<li><b>HeNe lasers like to be run:</b> This is more along the lines of an
 urban legion which applied to some old soft-sealed HeNe laser tubes that
 outgased contamination and/or leaked.  Modern hard-seal tubes - and this
 includes the tubes in every HP/Agilent laser ever built - can remain
 on the shelf for 15 years and perform like new.  All running does for them
 is use up some of their life!
</ul>
<p>
So, in short, the laser itself won't function any better if run continuously
compared to being turned on at most 90 minutes before needed as long as it
doesn't affect the environment in such a way as to change the calibration.
(90 minutes is HP/Agilent's spec for warmup to full accuracy on an unvented
laser, only 45 minutes on one with forced air cooling).  And for less
critical applications, simply waiting until READY comes on solid may be
adequate.  It should be possible to test for the overall effect by making a
measurements of a known length in each axis when the laser comes READY,
after 90 (or 45) minutes, and after 24 hours.  If any differences found
are acceptable, there is nothing to be gained by continuous operation.
<p>
Where the laser might be used for a few hours a week, as in a diamond
turning machine at a custom optics house, this should effectively extend
the life of the laser to infinity.

<h4><A NAME="hstinhl">Installing Newer HP/Agilent Metrology Lasers in Older Systems</A></h4>

As time passes, locating functional 5501A and to a somewhat lesser
extent, 5501B lasers to repair an older system is becoming
increasing difficult.  While it's sometimes possible to find a 5501A laser
from 1981 that has a like-new tube, the vast majority of them are good
for little more than door stops or high tech sculpture.
<p>
(The following deals with retrofitting systems using 5501A or 5501B lasers.
For really old systems using 5500A/B/C lasers, a few more issues are
present since the 5505A Measurement Display is more tightly coupled to
the laser and somewhat more is involved to keep it happy.)
<p>
It is often possible to install a more modern 5517 laser in place of a 5501A or
5501B.  5517 lasers are still in production and used working units are also
readily available at very reasonable cost.
<p>
Only a few relatively minor differences need to be accommodated.
With only a bit of resourcefulness, the total cost (excluding the laser and
labor) for this type of conversion will be under $100 in most cases:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Physical configuration:</b> All 5517 lasers except (unfortunately)
 the 5517A are the same size with the same mounting (foot location) as the
 5501A/B.  So if, for example, a 5517B would be acceptable based on other
 requirements, then installing it would not be a problem.  The 5517A is
 much larger and might not fit in a cramped space.
<p>
<li><b>DC power supplies:</b> The 5517 lasers require up to 2.3 amps at
 +15 VDC, much more than the 5501A/B.  But they require much less current
 at -15 VDC.  If the existing power supply is not adequate, a low cost
 replacement can be substituted.  There is nothing really special about
 the DC power supplies.
<p>
<li><b>Cable connections:</b> As long as the "Diagnostic Connector" (only
 present on the 5501A) is not being used, then this simply means replacing
 the Power and Reference connectors on the cable to the 5501A/B with the
 single connector that mates with the 5517.  If there is no desire to ever
 go back, then the respective cables can be cut and spliced.  The only
 connections are those for power (+15 VDC, -15 VDC, Common) and reference
 (REF, ~REF, and shields).
<p>
<li><b>REF (split) frequency:</b> If the larger 5517A can be shoe-horned
 into the available space, its REF frequency specifications are the same as
 those of the 5501A/B - 1.5 to 2 MHz.  If not, then the 5517B is the next
 best choice.  Its REF frequency range is 1.9 to 2.4 MHz.
 Normally, the higher REF frequency is desirable since it allows
 for a greater maximum speed of motion.  However, this is probably irrelevant
 for a retrofit and some measurement processing
 electronics may either not work correctly, or flag a REF frequency above 2.0
 MHz as being out of range.  So, this would need to be checked, preferably
 before committing to the conversion!  In some cases, even higher REF
 frequencies (such as from a 5517C or 5517D laser) will work fine but
 these would need to be confirmed either  based on published specifications
 or testing.  However, note that HP/Agilent specifications may be overly
 conservative, especially where the speed of motion is limited to that
 of the original system 5501A/B.
<p>
<li><b>F1 and F2 orientation:</b> For some reason probably known to absolutely
 no one on the face of this planet, the F1 and F2 axes are interchanged between
 the 5501A/B and all later HP/Agilent lasers.  The only practical consequence
 of this is that the sign for each axis will be flipped when the 5517 laser
 is installed, so there needs to be some means to change the sign for the
 direction of motion.
<p>
<li><b>Beam diameter:</b> This is not really a difference between the 5501A/B
 and other lasers, but simply a specification that probably should be the same
 for the replacement laser.  The most common is 6 mm, but 3 mm and 9 mm
 optics are sometimes installed.  These can be swapped.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="hstrohp">Repair of HP/Agilent Metrology Lasers</A></h4>

The custom tubes at the heart of these lasers are what will dominate
the cost of repair in most cases.  Electronics problems are relatively
uncommon, and generally minor when they do occur.  Where the tube is
found to be unusable, a replacement
tube will be needed.  New tubes are only available from Agilent and I
wouldn't even want to think about their cost but figure 75 percent or
more of the cost of a new laser.  And they probably wouldn't even
sell a tube without insisting on doing the installation as well
(at an additional charge).  One company that refurbishes tubes
for precision HeNe lasers is <A HREF="http://www.evergreenlaser.com/">Evergreen
Laser Corporation</A>.  But I do not know if they will deal with
HP/Agilent tubes, and rather doubt it due to the additional issues of
gaining access to the glass tube itself buried inside the
magnet assembly.  And even if they will, the cost of a
refurbished tube would probably exceed the cost of a complete guaranteed
full spec laser on eBay!  Another company I contacted who does repair
these lasers said candidly that their success in refurbing tubes was
spotty at best - and I think that was being overly generous.  One
company that does seem to claim a complete overhaul capability is
<A HREF="http://www.hongren.48h.tw/">Hong Ren Technology Co., Ltd.</A>
but I have no idea of their reliability.  But keep in mind that for
any of these, you're talking thousands of dollars, not garage sale
or even eBay prices!  From photos on their
Web site showing a non-standard tube mount, it appears as though they
may actually build their own tubes or provide tubes that are not from
Agilent.  Non-genuine tubes could have subtle differences in beam
profile, wavelength, stability, and lifetime.
<p>
However, even a tube deemed to be dead by Agilent due to low power
or an inability to stay lit, may often be made usable for many applications
(especially where only 1 or 2 measurement axes are required), for a test or
educational system, or as an emergency spare, with at most some relatively
minor low cost modifications to the laser, or possibly even simply an
adjustment.  But if the output power is so low that the beam actually
disappears periodically while warming up, there won't even be a beat
signal and such a tube is only good as a high tech paperweight with
built-in magnetic paper clip holder. :)
<p>
Assuming the tube is usable, except for late model Agilent 5517 lasers based
on digital Control PCBs, all of these lasers are very serviceable as far as
the electronics are concerned.  Pre-2000 lasers - most of what's found
surplus even in 2010 - will certainly have the
older Analog Control PCBs.  For these, even most of the HP house-numbered
ICs have standard equivalents available from major electronics
distributors, and none of the other electronic parts are special.  Operation
and service manuals are available which include detailed adjustment and
troubleshooting information and complete schematics.  And parts units
can be obtained on eBay at low cost.  Except for a blown fuse of my
own doing, dried up electrolytic capacitors on really old
lasers, a blown line driver chip, and bad REF photodiode, I've yet to see an
Analog Control PCB with any serious problems including defective
proprietary HP ICs.  However, on a
5501B, the heater driver transistors and main fuses were blown
as a result of dried up electronic capacitors on the Connector PCB.
So, for 5501B lasers, it's probably good preventive maintenence to
replace all 4 large electrolytic capacitors on the connector PCB
on a laser more than 10 or 15 years old as a precaution.
This is the only situation I know of where a high ESR/low uF capacitor
will result in actual damge to other components.
For more on the 5517 laser in general and the digital Control PCBs
in particular, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517l">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Construction</A>.
<p>
Now, if you're independently wealthy and would like to have Agilent repair
your laser, I've heard that an evaluation is about $500.  Essentially, they
confirm that it's an HP or Agilent laser and then tell you how much it will
cost to repair, if they are willing to repair it at all.  For a single
failure, the cost is a flat rate between $1,500 and $2,000, but the evaluation
fee will be applied toward that, thank goodness. :)
A "single failure" probably includes a blown
fuse, broken resistor, dried up capacitor, or bad IC.  I don't know whether
something like a degraded LCD in the beam sampler or blown HeNe laser
power supply would qualify as a single failure, or if two dried up
capacitors would be charged (no pun....) for separately.  And, it's
almost certain that if you read the fine print, the flat rate would
exclude a weak or dead HeNe laser tube that required replacing the tube
assembly even though it is technically a "single failure".  In that
case Agilent would simply return the laser after collecting their
evaluation fee.
<p>
For amusement, go to <A HREF="https://onlinestore.tm.agilent.com/Agilent/en/US/direct/onlinestore;jsessionid=75643567E240F4D29B7FBD47B347BDC0?cmd=eFAPHomePageDisplay&selectCountry=2300">Find-A-Part: Agilent's Test and Measurement Parts
Catalog</A> and enter a laser model like "5517D".  If you're not independently
wealthy, you better be sitting down when viewing the prices.  For example,
(in 2009) the cover is $344, the Control PCB is $1075, the HeNe laser
power supply is $496, and a small screw is a bargain at $1.24 each.  However,
prices for the operation and service manuals are not totally ridiculous -
$28.44 for the 5517A and $42.67 for the 5517B/C.  But the exact parts
available for each model laser seem to be somewhat random and forget about
even being able to order a new tube assembly (or parts).  They are
listed as: "Not orderable, contact Agilent for repair service".  Right. :-)
<p>
And before doing something silly, getting inside HP/Agilent lasers is
trivial.  On the large lasers (5517A, 5518A, 5518A/B) it's just a matter
of removing the 4 tiny screws on top and gently levering up the cover using a
knife blade.  On the small lasers (5501A/B, 5517B/C/D), rotate the front
turret so the large hole is at the bottom.  That will expose a slotted
head screw - a 1/4 turn fastener.  Push in and rotate 1/4 turn
counter-clockwise and the front plate will pop off.  The covers or shroud
can then be removed.  The only reason I've gone to this level of detail
is that I had an academic type ask me if that screw was for tuning the
laser frequency! :)

<h3><A NAME="hst5500a">Notes on the HP-5500A Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 5500A (or a substantially identical laser that had no model
designation) is the original Hewlett Packard metrology laser and was
unique compared to all that followed in having the interferometer
optics built-in.  Thus, the only required external optic required for
a single-axis system was a retro-reflector (cube-corner).  In fact,
the 5505A might have been considered as an option to the 5505A Measurement
Display as the only actual part number on it is: C01-5505A, though the
decorative strips do say 5500A.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube in the 5500A/B is generally similar to the one in
the 5500C and 5501A, but isn't quite identical and thus is not interchangeable,
at least not without some work.  The original patent for
the 5500A/B laser tube is: U.S. Patent #3,771,066: Gas Laser.
The most notable obvious differences between the 5500A/B tube and the one
in 5500C and 5501A are in
the PZT connector at the rear which is a ring (rather than a center
terminal) that allows the waste beam
from the HR mirror to escape, and the optics assembly at the front
of the tube assembly which only has the beam expander - the waveplates
are mounted externally (though strictly speaking these aren't part of the
tube itself).  And the glass tube is simply clamped to the mounting feet,
which are not part of the tube assembly.
<p>
Rather than using a portion of the main beam for feedback, there's a shielded
can with a photodiode behind a 1/4 waveplate and motor driven
rotating polarizer that
samples the waste beam from the back of the tube.  The photodiode signal
is used in a feedback loop to lock the laser so the modes are of equal
amplitude.  (See: U.S. Patent #3,701,042: D.C. Motor Circuit for Rotating
a Polarizer and Providing a Detector Synchronizer Signal
for a Laser Stabilizing System.)  Ironically, this
is actually closer in function to the LCD optical switch of the 5501B and
later lasers, than the polarizing beam samplers of the 5500C and 5501A
that followed the 5500A.  Since the 5500C/5501A tube has no waste beam
exiting the laser tube, duplicating this function would be a bit of a
challenge.
<p>
The 5500A is in the same size case as that of the 5500C.
The main difference between the 5500A and 5500C is what's at the front
of the laser.  The 5500A has interferometer optics and detectors for both
REF and MEAS within the case.  The 5500C has two channels of optical
receivers but no interferometer optics.  However, it was
possible to install linear interferometer optics inside the 5500C
to give it 5500A functionality.
<p>
The 5500A is also unique among HP lasers since it is the only one
with a run-time (hour) meter!
<p>
There are photos of a 5500A in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser
Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 2.49 or higher) under "Hewlett
Packard HeNe Lasers".
<p>
For several original articles introducing HP's interferometer-based
measurement system using the 5500A, see the
<A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1970-08.pdf">Hewlett
Packard Journal, August 1970</A>.
<p>
Also see <A HREF="http://www.n4mw.com/hp5526/hple.htm">Dave Meier's HP
Laser Interferometer Evolution Page</A> which includes a links to the
early HP catalog pages.
<p>
I have a 5500A laser (see gallery pages, above) which appears to be from
around 1970 based on the date code found on a 74H10 TTL IC in the optical
receiver.  Except for the shape of the beam expander mount and color of the
ballast resistor cover, my 5500A appears identical to the laser shown on the
last page of the August 1970 HP Journal.  An external HeNe laser power supply
was used to perform initial tested before being connected to a 5505A
Measurement Display.  The laser tube starts and runs flawlessly with
a raw output (after the beam expander but before the waveplates)
of at least 370 &micro;W and possibly as high as 450 &micro;W.
(The power varies with temperature as the tube warms up if not feedback
stabilized and I didn't run it long enough by itself to determine
the actual maximum power.)  Even the low end of 370 &micro;W would be
considered excellent power for a much newer 5501A tube.  The output power of
the laser is between 106 and 150 &micro;W (again depending on the temperature
as it's not locked).  If the locked output is anywhere near the higher end
of this range, then it's basically like it was when it was last serviced.
There is a note inside the laser saying: "120 &micro;W August 1978".
Perhaps the tube was also replaced at that time.
The reason for the large difference between tube output power and laser
output power is that the waveplates cut the power by 15 to 20
percent, and the internal interferometer optics suck up approximately half
of the remainder since most of the F1 frequency component doesn't exit the
laser.
<p>
When first attached to a 5505A, the laser powered up and locked instantly,
and within a couple minutes, I was able to make sub-micron measurements!
But, then at some point while my back was turned, the original HeNe laser
power supply inside the laser head failed.  Hard to believe!  Not like
the thing has probably been turned on for the first time in 20+ years! :)
I don't know if the failure was in the two transistor
driver, or inside the potted HV module, which is beautifully made in clear
semi-flexible plastic with no obvious damage.  But there could be a shorted
turn in the inverter transformer or a capacitor breaking down.  The driver
transistors passed ohmmeter tests and were getting equally warm, but the
output was only going to around 1 kV and then dropping to 0 V, never lighting
the tube.  So, I replaced it with a small brick power supply from a barcode
scanner, installed inside the original aluminum can to preserve authenticity.
Unless one knew exactly where to look, there would be no way to tell that it
wasn't totally original.
<p>
One thing that's probably only of curiosity value is that both the HeNe laser
HV power supply and the PZT HV power supply are driven from a common oscillator
which must be running for the PZT tuning to work.  Without tuning, the
5505A readout may still function, but the RESET button will keep flashing.
Newer versions of the 5500C, as well as the 5501A use independent
self-oscillating inverters in ugly bricks made of hard tan potting
compound for these two power supplies.  The earliest 5500Cs are probably
similar to the 5500A.
<p>
It's extremely easy to align the interferometer with my home-built authentic
replica of the retroreflector mount shown in the 1970 HP Journal article.  As
long as it adjusted so the return beam enters the optical receiver aperture
or even the tiny alignment holes in the laser head turret, the system is happy.
<p>
And here is the genuine imitation authentic setup hot off my time machine:

<h3><A NAME="hst5500c">Notes on the HP-5500C Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 5500C is one of the earliest of the HP metrology lasers (or
"Laser Transducer" in HP-speak), only preceeded by the 5500A (described
above).  Thus, the 5500C is somewhat
similar to a 5518A or 5519A/B in that it has an internal optical receiver
for the return beam.  This is actually comprised of 4 photodiodes wired
as two pairs with lenses surrounding the laser output aperture.
The aperture wheel may select either the horizontal or vertical pair.  Thus,
two independent optical receiver channels are actually available.  The "A"
channel is fed from the top and left photodiode, and the "B" channel fed
from the left and bottom photodiode.  Thus, with suitable interferometer
optics, a pair of measurement axes may be handled by the 5500C.  The 5518A
and 5519A/B only have a single optical receiver, but the assumption by the
time of their introduction was that the smaller 5501A/B and 5517 lasers
with external optical receivers would be used for multiple axis machines.
<p>
There are photos of a 5500C in
the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 2.48
or higher) under "Hewlett Packard HeNe Lasers".
<p>
Also see <A HREF="http://www.n4mw.com/hp5526/hple.htm">Dave Meier's HP
Laser Interferometer Evolution Page</A> which includes a link to the
early HP catalog pages.
<p>
The 5500C uses a HeNe laser tube with PZT tuning that appears
identical to the one in the 5501A, though the part number differs.
(The 5500A has a very similar, though not identical tube.  See the
description and patent reference in the previous section.)
The beam sampler for the feedback stabilization is of the common
modern polarizing beam-splitter variety with the control loop
driving the PZT of the laser tube to adjust cavity length.  But,
unlike the 5501A which only requires DC power supplies,
the 5500 requires the mating 5505A Measurement Display to even turn on and
stabilize since its HeNe laser power supply and PZT power supply
are controlled by the 5505A.  Although the HeNe laser power supply could
be run open loop with a variable DC voltage, this would not
provide current regulation.  However, the PZT power supply of later
5500Cs which appears to be a potted module inside more potting,
can be used as a stand-alone PZT, PMT, or other variable HV low
current power supply since its output is fairly linear with
respect to input from 0 to 15 V, which is multiplied
approximately by somewhere between 100 and 200 to produce the
output voltage.  (Although I have not seen it specifically stated,
the PZT power supply appears to be capable of more than 2 kV based on
the 5501A schematics.)  Both HV Control and PZT Control are really just the
power input to a self oscillating inverter.  (Very early versions of
the 5500C and the 5500A
have the inverter transformers and other high voltage components potted inside
metal cans with the driver circuitry on separate PCBs fed from a
common oscillator.)
<p>
The pinout for the self contained PZT power supply module is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pinkish purple: -15 VDC.
<li>Black: ground.
<li>White/red: PZT CON (-15 to 0 V for 0 to 1,500 V or more out).

If constructing your own cable, the wires to pins B and N should be shielded
twisted pair, shield to pin A, and the wires to pins K and M should be
shielded twisted pair, shield to pin L.  The shield probably isn't critial
for relatively short cables, but use the twisted pair.  Size the voltage
(+5 and +15) and Gnd wires to handle a couple amps.  HV Control may also
need to supply some current.

<h3><A NAME="hst5501">Notes on the HP-5501 Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 5501 is the successor to the 5500.  However, the
5500C and 5500A had optical receivers for a return beam built-in.
(Two in the case of the 5500C.)  The 5501 requires an external
optical receiver for each axis, but thus has no limitation on the
number of axes other than there being adequate beam power.
<p>
The 5501B is a functional replacement for the 5501A.  Locking of the 5501B
typically takes 5 to 9 minutes compared to 10 seconds or so for the 5501A,
but this is of no consequence for machines that are run for hours or years.
In terms of optical characteristics, and power requirements and
reference signals (including connector pinouts),
they are equivalent.  However, the 5501B lacks the Diagnostic (J3)
connector of the 5501A, so other system components may not be happy
and some substitutes may need to be provided.
Going the other way doesn't have this issue, but if a 5501A is installed
in place of a 5501B, it may be necessary to press the Retune button from
time-to-time whereas there is no such button or need on the 5501B!
This may be anywhere from a few hours to never, but it would be a good
idea to do this periodically at convenient times between measurement
runs, at least until the system has reached thermal equilibrium.
Performing a Retune cycle does not compromise the accuracy in any way.
Once the Retune LED goes out, it's ready to go again.
Even from a cold start, a laser may go 12 hours or more without requiring
a Retune.  After that, once a day may be more than sufficient.
<p>
Operation and service manuals for the HP-5501A and HP-5501B may be found on the

<h4><A NAME="hst5501a">HP-5501A</A></h4>

The 5501A, 5500C, and 5500A appear to be the only models that use a
special HeNe laser tube which has its cavity length fine tuned by a PieZo
Transducer (PZT).  (The 5501B and all successors still use a special HeNe
laser tube but it has an internal heater for fine cavity length control
rather than a PZT.)  The OC (front) mirror and PZT with the HR (rear)
mirror inside the laser tube are held in place by a spring against a spacer
tube (the actual bore of the HeNe laser) made of Zerodur, a special very low
thermal expansion coeffient glass/ceramic developed by the
<A HREF="http://www.us.schott.com/english/">Schott Glass</A>.
In fact, longitudinal mode cycling is virtually non-existent with these lasers.
<p>
Compared to the 5500C, the 5501A is in a much smaller lighter
case with simplified optics and totally different electronics.  See
<A HREF="hp5501-1.jpg">Interior of the HP-5501A Laser Head - Left Side</A> and
<A HREF="hp5501-2.jpg">Interior of the HP-5501A Laser Head - Right Side</A>.
The HeNe laser tube dominates the interior space in both views.  The high
voltage piezo driver power supply brick is visible under the magnets at the
center of the tube.  The HeNe laser power supply brick is underneath the
output end of the tube.  The piezo driver electronics circuit board at
the far right end of the right side view.  The optical sensor circuit
board is at the far left of the left side view.
<p>
The naked tube is shown in <A HREF="hp5501at.jpg">HP-5501A Laser Tube
Removed From Magnet and Output Optics Assembly</A>.  The normally enclosed
part is really just a very think walled fine-ground bore inside an outer glass
envelope.  A spring (visible through the glass at the left) at the rear holds
the PZT, HR mirror, bore, and OC mirror in place.  No adjustment is possible.
There are distinct multiple spots on the card because the output window is at
a slight angle and not AR coated.
<p>
Both the HeNe laser power supply and piezo power supply run off
the -15 VDC power supply.  An interlock switch (easily defeated)
prevents operation with the cover removed.  In the 5500A and 5500C, these
power supplies are regulated by the 5505A Measurement Display.
In the 5501A, the potted power supply bricks have no inputs
other than power.  Rather, current and voltage regulation are accomplished
by controlling the input current.  For the HeNe laser
power supply in the 5501A, as well as later versions of the 5500C,
while the passive HV components are buried in potting compound, the
two 2N5192 driver transistors are mounted on the outside of the brick
and are replaceable.  However, from my experience, when the transistors
blow, there is probably a fault in the potted section so replacing them
doesn't help,  I've successfully replaced the 5501A HeNe laser power
supply with a common barcode scanner brick, the Laser Drive model 103-23.
This has an input rance of 21 to 31 VDC at less than 0.5 A, and an output
of 1.1 to 1.5 kV at 3.5 mA (fixed).  The 3.5 mA is a bit higher than
the labeled current on most 5501A tubes, but seems to be acceptable and
actually beneficial for some high mileage tubes that like to run at
a slightly higher current.  But, adjustable versions of these supplies
are readily available.  I connected the supply between the HV Control
(white/green wire) and -15 VDC (purple wire) with the pot set fully CCW
(max current).  This assures that the 5501A current regulator will
not attempt to compete with the brick's internal regulator.  However,
with some HeNe laser power supplies, it may be possible to use the 5501A's
regulator to *reduce* the current in a stable manner.  This is left as
an exercise for the student as it may not work in general.
<p>
The output of the laser tube is passed through a quarter wave plate to
convert the circular polarization to orthogonal linear polarization
components, and then through a half wave plate to rotate the linear
polarization by an arbitrary, but fixed angle to line the two linearly
polarized components up with subsequent optics.  These waveplates are
adjustable with respect to orientation around the optical axis of the
laser as expected.  But the angle of each waveplate along one of its
principle axes with respect to the optical axis of the laser is also
adjustable - presumably to optimize the 1/4 or 1/2 wave performance.
They are both very thin and may be zero order waveplates, possibly
made of optical grade mica.  The beam is then expanded
and collimated and passed through an angled partially reflecting plate
located just beyond the collimating lens on the laser tube assembly.
This deflects about 20 percent of the beam to a polarizing beamsplitter
which sends each component to its own photosensor to provide the frequency
control feedback.  A control loop uses these signals to adjust the PZT,
and thus resonator length, so that the two signals are of equal amplitude.
The difference of the two signals is the frequency/phase reference.
<p>
The laser stabilization control algorithm is actually dirt simple: The
voltages from the photodiodes corresponding to the two polarization
components are compared in an integrator which maintains the PZT voltage
at a level so they are equal.  (There is an adjustment to
compensate for slight differences in amplitude resulting from beamsplitter
ratio and photodiode sensitivity.)  While crude and simple to implement, this
approach is adequate to achieve the needed stability.
The electronic reference signal is derived from the slight residual
difference frequency present in one of the polarization components.
<p>
While the spacer rod has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion, it isn't
exactly zero, so as the system heats up (over hours), the cavity
length will still change slightly.  Eventually, the PZT voltage may
be unable to compensate.  The PZT voltage is compared with fixed upper
and lower limits which are well within the range over which locking
is assured.  When either limit is passed, the "Tune Fault" flag is set
turning on the "Retune" LED and asserting the "Retune_Status" signal.
The laser may be retuned via a pushbutton or external
TTL signal).  This clamps the PZT control voltage at its lowest
value for a short time and then releases it to ramp up to the lock point.
Requiring external intervention (whether manually or by computer) assures
that a measurement will never be made when the laser isn't stable, nor
will one in progress be interrupted due to the laser relocking unexpectedly.
<p>
The 5501A laser head requires +15 VDC and -15 VDC for
power.  (There is also a +5 VDC pin but it is an output according to
the manual.)  The two voltages (and common) are all that is needed to
operate the laser head but an interlock switch (on the right side at the
rear of the case) must be depressed to turn on
the laser tube.  I haven't yet looked at the output with a photodiode
or scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer but after a few seconds, the "Retune"
LED goes off, similar to if the "Retune" button is pressed.  And then
there is a stable reference signal.  I have since
acquired an operation and service manual for the HP-5501A laser head which
confirms the information above.

<h4><A NAME="hst5501b">HP-5501B</A></h4>

The 5501B uses a very different HeNe laser tube of more conventional
contruction but which has an internal heating coil for cavity tuning.
It is also physically similar to the tube in the 5517B/C/D/E lasers.
The 5501A and 5501B are in the same size case and look very similar
externally.  See <A HREF="hp5501-3.jpg">Interior of the HP-5501B Laser
Head - Left Side</A> and <A HREF="hp5501-4.jpg">Interior of the HP-5501B
Laser Head - Right Side</A>.  See <A HREF="hp5517t1.gif">Internal Structure
of Hewlett Packard/Agilent 5501B and 5517B/C/D Laser Tube Assemblies</A> for
the anatomy and <A HREF="5517b-t1.jpg">Tube Assembly Used in HP-5501B and
HP-5517B/C/D Two-Frequency HeNe Lasers</A> for the a photo of the beast.
The actual glass laser tube is shown in <A HREF="hp5517g1.jpg">Hewlett
Packard/Agilent 5501B and 5517B/C/D HeNe Laser Tube Removed from Magnet/Optics
Assembly</A>
<p>
Like the 5501A, the 5501B also requires only +/-15 VDC to power up.
There is no case interlock on the laser I have, though one is shown in the
manual so I assume this is either an addition or deletion depending on
version.  When power is applied, at first, only the
+/-15 VDC power LEDs come on.  After 3 to 6 minutes,
the "READY" LED begins to flash at about a 1 second rate.  After another
1.5 minutes or so, the "Laser On" LED comes on and the beam appears.  Finally,
a minute or so after that, the READY LED comes on solid and remains that
way.  Note that this method of turning on the laser only after the
temperature set-point has been reached is unique to the 5501B.  All the
other HP/Agilent lasers turn on the laser with power-on.
Specific times for one test beginning from a cold start at an ambient
temperature of about 65 &deg;F were: (min:sec) 3:15, 1:35, and 0:48.
The first of the times is called "preheat" and is determined by how long
it takes for what HP calls the "laser rod" to reach operating temperature.
The laser rod is the large glass bore of the laser tube to which the
mirrors are clamped at either end.  It thus controls cavity length.
The temperature is sensed by disabling
the heater drive and measuring the resistance of the heater coil every
25.6 seconds.  The warmup is much shorter if the laser is restarted
after having been running: 1:00, 1:20, and 0:50.  Only after the READY
LED is on solid, do the reference signals appear.  The 5501B
adjusts the cavity length so that the two polarized components of
the beam (the Zeeman split longitudinal modes) have equal power.
Interestingly, there is only one photodiode
sensor which is alternatively switched between beams using a liquid
crystal polarization rotator.  A sample-and-hold then outputs to the
error amplifier of the optical mode control feedback loop.
<p>
There are two outputs of about 5 to 6 V p-p (centered about 0 V), 180
degrees out of phase.  For this laser, the reference frequency is
about 1.80 MHz.  There is no need for a "Retune" button as with
the PZT based system of the 5501A.  Also unlike the 5501A, there
are no other signals to or from the 5501B (no large connector),
only the +5 VDC output on the power connector, and a fused +15 VDC
output on the reference connector.
<p>
Although the control board inside the 5501B looks similar to that of
the "small" 5517 lasers, it is not interchangeable with them as some
functions like the heater drive have are on the small "connector PCB"
at the back-end of the case.
<p>
There were two problems with the first 5501B I acquired that I had to deal
with.  The first was that the tube wouldn't stay on stably at the 3.5 mA
setting (fixed) of the power supply but works fine at 4 mA.  Such a condition
is usually due to the tube having been run for
a long time, which wouldn't be surprising with a surplus 5501B laser head.
Since the existing power supply has no current adjustment, I needed to find
a similar size HeNe laser power supply brick
(1"x1.5"x4" or smaller) that will run on 15 VDC to replace it that can be
set for 4 to 4.5 mA.  The tube seemed healthy enough otherwise.  I installed
one that runs the tube at 4 mA but draws more DC input current than the
original, and possibly for that reason, the controller aborts and resets
after about 1 second when it turns the laser on.  For now, to get around
this, I have connected the HeNe laser power supply directly to the raw
-15 VDC and added a transistor to drive its enable input when the original
laser power turns on.  That appeared to work fine.  But after replacing the
cover, the laser tube wouldn't come on. :(  I discovered that it needed the
room light to start!  I had thought this to be a relatively rare malady for
HeNe laser tubes, but more common for neon lamps and glow-tube fluorescent
lamp starters.  However, it turns out that a decent percentage of
HP/Agilent HeNe lasers start more quickly when illuminated.
So, there is now a decorative red LED shining on the back of the tube
which is lit when the laser is powered.  An HeNe laser power supply with
a higher starting voltage would probably make this kludge, oops, feature,
unnecessary.  But no one will ever know about it. :)  While many of these
higher mileage HP/Agilent lasers can benefit from this addition, since the
5501B turns the laser on and expects it to come on quickly, it is more
critical than with the other lasers like the 5517s that really don't care
whether the laser is outputting a beam or not, until they actually try to
lock.  However, in either case, if the laser takes too long to lock,
associated equipment like the 5508A Measurement Display may flag it as
a failure.

<h3><A NAME="hst5505a">Notes on the Hewlett Packard 5505A Measurement Display</A></h3>

The HP-5505A is a part of the HP-5525A/B and HP-5526A Laser Measurement
Systems, which are designed for very precise single-axis measurements in
a machine tool environment.
<p>
The HP-5525A was used in the original HP interferometer introduced around
1970 and includes the HP-5505A Measurement Display and the HP-5500A
two-frequency HeNe laser head.
The 5500A laser has the interferometer optics built-in and
thus only requires an external retroreflector (cube-corner) on the
moving part to be mesaured.  The HP-5525B upgraded to the 5500C laser
head which requires external interformeter optics but allows for two
axis measurements (with a pair of 5505As!).  The 5526A seems to have
added a variety of options and but it's not clear how it really differs
from the 5525B.
<p>
The 5525A/B and 5526A can be set up in the field with relative
ease with a minimum number of individual components and no need for
a control computer as its basic functions are built-in to the HP-5505A.
It provides for the stand-alone precise measurement of position and
velocity.  But straightness and angle are not directly supported.
<p>
The 5505A implementation of the display function is all done in MSI TTL
logic with a pair of 36 bit counter/registers for REF and DOPPLER (same
as MEAS for other HP lasers), with a decimal adder/subtractor
to generate the result.  This is all on multiple PCBs and while there is
one labeled "Program", there is no actual microprocessor controlling the
system.
<p>
The 5525A, 5525B, and 5526 all require the 5505A display but differ in the
laser and options. (There may be some
minor changes required to convert an older 5505A to be used in a 5526A system.)
The following is from the
<A HREF="http://www.n4mw.com/hp5526/hp5526docs.htm">N4MW HP 5526A
Documentation Page</A> which also has links to the actual HP catalog pages
for each system.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>HP-5525A:</b> Laser head with internal linear interferometer.
 This was the 5500A laser head but originally had no model number.
 Options were limited to error plotting, recording, automatic compensator
 and a beam bender.  Basic linear interferometer system price: $11,500.
<p>
<li><b>HP-5525B:</b> 5500A laser head with external interferometer.
 Options included the 10552A Resolution Extender (10X) and the 10510A
 automatic compensator.  Basic linear interferometer system price: $13,950.
<p>
<li><b>HP-5526A:</b> 5500C laser head with external interferometer.  Additional
 options included angular and straightness optics, a single beam
 interferometer, second axis add-on and plane mirror conversion kit.
 A printer was available, but no computerized system yet. Basic linear
 interferometer system price: $12,400.
</ul>
<p>
5500Cs have also been showing up with internal linear interferometers like
the 5500A.  I haven't seen any reference to this as a standard product though.
I wonder if they were retrofits for customers who found their original
5525A configuration adequate or whined when their 5500As went bad and
wanted an exact replacement.
<p>
The HP-5525A/B and HP-5526A are very obsolete, but many are still in
use.  5505As show up on eBay, often for next to nothing.  To non-interferometer
geeks, the set of Nixie tubes is probably more valuable than a working unit!
However, being so old, they often have problems, and at least some of the
ICs like the Nixie tube drivers are proprietary parts and no longer available.
<p>
For info (or lack thereof):

<li>The Agilent Web site doesn't appear to have anything useful on any of
 these systems.  Hard to believe! :( :)
<p>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.n4mw.com/hp5526/hp5526docs.htm">N4MW HP 5526A
 Documentation Page</A> has a variety of info on the 5526A, though not
 detailed service information.  The most useful is probably
 the "05526-90068 Operator's Handbook".
<p>
<li>The
 <A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1970-08.pdf">Hewlett
 Packard Journal, August 1970</A> introduces HP interferometers with the
 5500A laser and 5525 display. and <A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1971-12.pdf">Hewlett Packard Journal, December 1971</A> on the
 remote interferometer and the 5525B.
</ul>
<p>
The laser connector on the back of the 5505A is the same type and has the same
pinout as that on the 5500A and 5500C heads.  
The 5508A supplies +/-15 VDC power for the laser head.  It also controls
both HeNe laser power supply current regulation and PZT laser tuning.
<p>
To use the 5505A with a 5500A, all that's required is a 05500-60025 cable
and a retroreflector (cube-corner) as shown in
<A HREF="hp5525a1.jpg">Original HP-5525A with HP-5500A, HP-5505A, and
Retroreflector - View 1</A>.  (Additonal photos can be found in the
section above on the 5500A laser.)  It's straightforward to make a cable.
The connectors are standard and everything is wired 1:1 at both ends.  To
use the 5505A with the HP-5500C laser also requires external interferometers
optics.  All of the standard configurations that have separate outgoing and
return beams should work.
<p>
To use the 5508A with other HP laser heads will require a custom
cable and possibly a separate optical receiver which can be any version
of the 10780 (A, B, C, F, U).  However, some circuitry may need to be added
to the 5505A to keep it happy by making it think it still has control
of PZT tuning.
<p>
FWIW in the "well that's interesting department", here is the board set from
another 5505A.  This is a rather vintage sample, Serial Number: 2016A01966,
which puts its manufacturing date around 1970:

<h3><A NAME="hst5508a">Notes on the Hewlett Packard 5508A Measurement Display</A></h3>

The HP-5508A is a part of the HP-5528A Laser Measurement System, which
is designed for very precise single-axis measurements in a machine tool
environment.
<p>
The HP-5528A includes the HP-5508A Measurement Display, an HP-5518A
two-frequency HeNe laser head on heavy duty tripod, a variety of
interferometer optics, and optional environmental sensors, and other
stuff. :)  So, this system can be set up in the field with relative
ease with a minimum number of individual components and no need for
a control computer as its basic functions are built-in to the HP-5508A.
It provides for the stand-alone precise measurement of position,
velocity, angle, and straightness by using the appropriate
interferometer assemblies.
<p>
The 5508A implementation of the display function consists of X16 frequency
multipliers for REF and MEAS, which are then applied to
separate 16 bit up counters.  These initiate a non-maskable
interrupt to the microcontroller when either exceeds the half way
point (the MSB gets set).  They are then stopped while separate
small "swallow counters" absorb pulses occurring while the
interrupt is processed and the position is updated.  The microcontroller
is kept rather busy, but since it doesn't have all that much else do
do, should be quite happy. :)
<p>
Although the HP-5528A is considered obsolete by Agilent, it's still
very useful and surplus systems or components are now much cheaper.
The Agilent 5529A Dynamic Calibrator is the replacement for the 5528A.
Rather than a dedicated display, it requires a PC (not included).
But aside from the slightly higher REF frequency of the 5529A laser head
(generally irrelevant in these types of typically slow speed applications),
the precision is no better than that of the 5528A.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Agilent Web site has links to two large documents on the 5528A.
 But either of these is probably much more than you probably need or want
 unless you are actually attempting to operate or maintain a complete system:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The
  <A HREF="http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/05528-90022.pdf">5528A
  Laser Measurement System User's Guide</A> (416 pages, 17 MB) goes into more
  detail than you could ever want on this thing.  But what the manual appears
  to lack are any detailed specifications or troubleshooting and repair info.
<p>
 <li>However, the <A HREF=
  "http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/05528-90023.pdf">HP-5528A
  Measurement System User's Manual</A> (494 pages, 77 MB) contains even
  more about this system and its components.  In addition to
  installation, setup, and operating instructions, it has optics and
  circuit descriptions and principles of operation, troubleshooting,
  and complete schematics for the 5518A laser, 5508A Measurement Display,
  and more.
 </ul>
<p>
  (Both of these are also accessible directly from
  <A HREF="http://www.agilent.com/">Agilent</A>.  Search for "5528A".)
<p>
<li>The
 <A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1983-04.pdf">Hewlett
 Packard Journal, April 1983</A> may be more useful with several articles
 providing an overview of the 5528A system with the 5517 and 5518A lasers,
 and 5508A Measurement Display.
</ul>
<p>
The laser connector on the back of the 5508A is the same type and has the same
pinout as that on the 5517 and 5518A laser heads.  The one "No Connect" pin
on the 5517 connector (pin A) is used to drive the MEAS beam level indicator
on the front of the 5508A.  The meter reading seems to be proportional to the
current flowing out of this pin, from an internal +5 VDC source, with
approximately -2 mA being full scale.  Pins B and C that are also unused
on the 5517 lasers now get ~MEAS and MEAS.  (They are connected to line
drivers on the 5517 lasers but only used for testing.)  The 5508A supplies
+/-15 VDC power for the 5518A laser head.
<p>
There are several other connectors on the rear of the 5508A for various
environmental sensors (temperature, pressure, etc.) and even a remote
control.  (I'd like to see that!)  There is also a IEEE-488/GPIB/HP-IB
interface for control and data acquisition.
<p>
To use the 5508A with a 5518A, all that's required is a 10793A/B/C cable,
which is wired 1:1 at both ends.  To use the 5508A with other HP laser
heads will require a custom cable, and possibly a separate optical
receiver which can be any version of the 10780 (A, B, C, F, U).
Except for ~MEAS and MEAS, all signals are wired 1:1 for 5517s.
However, I'm not sure whether all versions of the 5508A will work
over all velocities with any of these except the 5517A.  The 5517B/C/D
have REF frequencies, and result in possible MEAS frequencies, that may
be too high, at least under some conditions.  It is also possible
to use the 5508A with the 5501A/B lasers, but the connectors
are totally different.  For the 5519A/B laser, these same issues apply.
The connector of the 5519A/B provides only the REF and MEAS
signals as this laser head has an internal power supply that plugs into
the AC line.  To use the 5508A with 5500A/C lasers would require additional
circuitry to provide the HeNe laser current control and PZT tuning.
<p>
One way to get around the REF frequency issue is to build a divide-by-two
circuit for REF and MEAS that goes between the laser and 5508A.  This is
simply a dual differential line receiver, a pair of D flip-flops, and a
dual differential line driver.  Add a switch to select straight through
or divide-by-two if desired.  Of course, measurements values will now
be halved unless a plane mirror interferometer is used, in which its
doubling will be exactly offset by the halving in the divider!
<p>
The only thing that won't work when using laser heads other than the 5518A
without additional effort is the beam level meter on the 5508A front panel,
fed from pin A of the laser connector.  This seems to require a
current of 0 to 2 mA to Ground from an internal +5 VDC source.  The
test-point on the outside of all 10780 receivers generates a voltage
related to signal level, but simple voltage to current converter
circuit (1 transistor and a few resistors) is then needed to
interface to the meter input.  If you're not a purist, this can just
be ignored as it is not used anywhere and its only purpose is to
aid in optical alignment and confirmation of adequate signal.  But
the 10780 test-point services the same function.
<p>
In summary:
<p>
<ul>
<li>To use a 5517 laser with the 5508A, all pins on the 18 pin connectors
 except B,C,D and E,F,R get wired 1:1 with #22 hookup wire.
 Use twisted pairs for B,D and C,D and connect to the MEAS output of
 the 10780.  Use twisted pairs between the laser and 5508A connector
 for pins E,R, and F,R for REF.  Or, hack a 10793A/B/C cable. :)
<p>
 To use a 5501A/B laser with the 5508A, wire the REF signals from the laser
 into E,R and F,R of the 5508A connector with twisted pairs, and the MEAS
 signal from the 10780 into pins B,D and C,D of the 5508A connector with
 twisted pairs.  Power (or at least -15 VDC) for the laser may have to come
 from a separate supply as I do not know if the 5508A has enough capacity
 on the -15 VDC output for the 5501A/B lasers (more than 1/2 A) since the
 5517 lasers require only 20 mA.
</ul>
<p>
I've attached my 5508A to my measurement test setup and initially have been
using a 5517D laser head with it.  I'm a bit surprised that this even works
with the 5508A as it has a REF frequency almost double the maximum of even
the later versions of the 5518A laser.  I don't know if it will run at
full velocity, but for modest speeds, the readings seem to be fine.  But
I intend to add the divide-by-two circuit as insurance.

<h3><A NAME="hst5517">Notes on the HP/Agilent 5517 Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

There are several versions of the HP (now Agilent) 5517 series.  All are very
similar to the 5501B in terms of the physical characteristics of the HeNe
laser tube and the control electronics.  Except for the 5517A, all versions
are also in the same small rectangular case as the 5501B.  However, the
5501B has a pair of connectors, one for power and the other for the
reference signal; all 5517s have a single connector for power and signals.
(Pinout below.)  For the 5517s (and 5518A and 5519A/B), F1, the lower frequency
output is horizontally polarized and F2, the higher frequency output
is vertically polarized.
<p>
When warming up, the difference frequency only appears for perhaps 10
percent of the time during mode sweep  - only when the Zeeman
modes are near equal amplitude on the split neon gain curves.
The difference frequency is maximum and the output power is minimum at
the center of this region, which is also where it will eventually lock.
This is normal behavior for these lasers based on what is shown in
<A HREF="zeemode1.gif">Axial Zeeman Split HeNe Laser Mode Behavior</A>.
Note that while there may be some other longitudinal modes present,
at least one of the other pairs is too weak to lase and thus there
will be no beat except from the main pair, and then only when very close
to being positioned symetrically on the Zeeman-split neon gain curves.
In fact, only the main F1/F2 mode is present when locked.
While other rogue mods would not produce any beat signal, they would
result in problems in the interferometer and possible transient errors.

<h4><A NAME="hst5517s">HP/Agilent 5517A/B/C/D</A></h4>

The 5517A is in the larger case with a trapezoidal shape but does not
include an optical receiver with an external input like the physically
similar 5518A and 5519A/B.  Converting a 5517A into a 5518A is simply a
matter of installing the internal optical receiver PCB and replacing or
removing the shutter assembly on the front of the laser.
Of all the 5517s, it is the only one to have a tube
that might appear to be of lower manufacturing quality, and is larger than the
the tube in the others, and the tube in the 5501B.  But the real
reason may be that it is cast with precise locating pegs so that a tube can
be swapped without requiring even minimal alignment.  And the 5517 tube is
physically nearly interchangeable with the 5518A and 5519A/B.  (For
installation in a 5519A/B, there is a small piece of metal that needs to be
removed to provide clearance for the 5519's internal DC power supply.)
More below.  <A HREF="hp5517-1.jpg">Interior of the 5517A Laser Head</A>
shows the major laser/optics components of the Hewlett-Packard 5517A
laser.  The actual HeNe laser tube is inside the gray
cylindrical housing which also has a cylindrical magnet for Zeeman splitting
the HeNe laser lines to create the difference reference frequency
in the interferometer application.  See the previous sections for
more information on these two-frequency lasers.  It's very well
made but not particularly unusual except for a heater coil wrapped
around the bore <i>inside</i> the HeNe laser tube, used to control
cavity length very precisely.  Here are some photos and a detailed
diagram of the internal construction:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="hp5517ta.jpg">Tube Used in HP-5517B Two-Frequency HeNe Laser -
 View 1</A> and <A HREF="hp5517tb.jpg">Tube Used in HP-5517B Two-Frequency
 HeNe Laser - View 2</A> shows a typical sample.  This one is from a
 5517B, but the 5517A and other 5517s, as well as the 5501B use glass laser
 tubes that are virtually identical, at least physically.
<p>
<li>For example, see <A HREF="hp5517t1.jpg">Tube Used in HP-5517D
 Two-Frequency HeNe Laser</A>.  The only obvious difference is the
 lack of any backing disk behind the HR mirror.
<p>
<li>Another tube from a 5517B taken to bits (this is rather gory) is shown
 in <A HREF="hp5517tx.jpg">Individual Parts of HP-5517B HeNe Laser Tube</A>.
 (This laser tube was already physically broken <i>within the magnet
 assembly</i> when I received it, so no sacrifices to the gods of dead
 lasers were needed before taking it apart.)  The only things missing
 from this photo are a "few" pieces of glass that didn't survive the
 ordeal. :)  The fat glass bore simply appears to "float" within the outer
 glass cylinders at each end of the tube.  Its position is fixed by the
 balance of force from the two springs applied via the backing disks
 and mirrors.  Only a very precise fit of the bore within the portion
 of the outer cylinder at the anode-end (left) assures that the discharge
 goes through the central capillary and doesn't sneak around it to the cathode.
 The coatings on the HR and OC mirrors (sitting next to their respective
 backing disks) show up as blue in the photo due to the angle of the
 lighting, but have the normal gold in reflection and blue in transmission
 for 633 nm HeNe mirrors.  Although not apparent in the photo, the
 OC (on the right) is highly curved with a Radius of Curvature of about
 140 mm - quite short for a HeNe laser.  This results in a nearly
 hemispherical cavity as determined by the length of the bore ("mirror
 spacing rod") with a length of 127 mm.
<p>
<li>The 5517B/C/D (and subsequent HP/Agilent lasers) are in a smaller
 case with a slightly different tube assembly as shown in
<A HREF="hp5517l1.jpg">HP/Agilent 5517B/C/D Laser Transducer - Left Side
 View</A>.  It is electrically compatible but cannot be made to fit even
 with a big hammer. :)  And removed from the body in
 <A HREF="5517b-t1.jpg">Tube Assembly Used in HP-5501B and
 HP-5517B/C/D Two-Frequency HeNe Lasers</A>.
<p>
<li>The major electronics, the Analog Control PCB, is shown
 in <A HREF="hp5517r1.jpg">HP/Agilent 5517B/C/D Laser Transducer - Right Side
 View</A>   This, too, is nearly identical electrically but not physically.
<p>
<li>A detailed diagram that applies to all of them except for the frame/feet is
 shown in <A HREF="hp5517t1.gif">Internal Structure
 of Hewlett Packard/Agilent 5501B and 5517B/C/D Laser Tube Assemblies</A>.
 The only difference for the 5517A, 5518A, and 5519A/B is in the mounting of
 the tube, magent, beam expander, and waveplates in the cast base metal frame
 instead of a machined aluminum optical assembly with separate base metal feet.
</ul>
<p>
Unlike most other internal mirror HeNe laser tubes, there are no mirror
adjustments.  The mirrors are held in place against the thick glass bore
(or mirror spacing rod as HP calls it) by spring pressure alone.
So, the ends of the bore and mirrors
must be ground to a precision sufficient for alignment to be near perfect.
The distance between the mirrors is 127 mm in the 5517B corresponding to an
FSR or longitudinal mode spacing of about 1.18 GHz.  The purpose of having
multiple glass backing disks
behind the OC mirror is not really known.  But along with the appropriate
length spacing rod, these would provide a means of selecting cavity length
by using a variable number of them without having to manufacture multiple
(glass) tube designs.  So, everything could be identical
except for the spacing rod and number of backing disks installed behind
the HR mirror and in front of the OC mirror, and perhaps the length of the
associated spring(s).  Having at least one backing disk may be desirable
to reduce stress on the mirrors from the springs, but some tubes don't
have any behind the HR mirror.  So backing disks may simply be present to
accomodate different spring sizes so the bore is properly positioned.
I do not yet know if other model lasers have different cavity lengths.
Visual examination of 5501B, 5517A, 5517B, 5517D, and 5519B tube assemblies
from the front after removing the beam expanders and waveplates has been
inconclusive.  And the glass tubes from 5517B and 5517D lasers appear
physically identical in all dimensions that matter from the outside -
I have yet to smash a 5517D tube to go deeper!
I was expecting the low REF frequency 5517A to have some
obvious difference compared to the high REF frequency 5517D,
like only a single backing disk behind the OC and maybe a shorter
spring, but this does not appear to be the case.  So, if they are
all the same, what is the purpose of the extra space in front with
5 backing disks and the extra length spring?  If anyone has
taken more of these tubes to bits or X-rayed them, or can measure the
non-Zeeman difference frequency between longitudinal modes (and
thus the FSR yielding the cavity length), and can thus shed some coherent
light on this topic :), please contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
In terms of cavity length, the 5517 tubes are very similar to typical 1 mW
barcode scanner HeNe laser tubes.  Their relatively low power - always
under 1 mW and often much less - may be accounted for by the combination of
the magnetic field, precisely specified OC mirror reflectance, and
possibly isotopically pure helium and neon and fill pressure, to
achieve the desired Zeeman beat frequency range for each model
of the 5517.  This is consistent with the generally lower output power
for higher REF frequency lasers - 5517Ds almost always have much lower power
than 5517As when new.  The heater connections with red and purple wire stubs
sticking out can be seen at the left of the tube.  The purple one
also attaches to the cathode via a piece of springy sheet metal,
no welds.  The anode connection goes through the
outer glass envelope but there does not seem be a glass seal into the
bore, but simply a hole drilled in it to coincide with the anode
location.  Even after totally disassembling a tube,
it's not clear what prevents the discharge from bypassing the
bore unless there was some other sealant present that got lost in
the process.  But there are no traces of any, nor anything visible
in two other tubes.  The fit between the bore and surrounding glass cylinder
is quite close but even this wouldn't normally guarantee that the
discharge goes through the bore, especially on hard-start tubes.
The magnet is a single piece cylinder of what looks
like AlNiCo with an inner diameter a few mm larger than the tube.
It extends at the left and right ends of the tube to exactly where
the discharge begins and ends.
<p>
I have measured the tube+ballast voltage on one 5517B laser to be about
1,675 V at 3.5 mA.  This may be a bit greater than typical since the tube
was high mileage, though with normal start and run behavior.  The ballast
was 100K so the actual voltage across the tube was 1,325 V,  This is still
somewhat greater than expected for a laser with a power output of less
than 1 mW.  Part of the reason may be that the magnet probably
slightly increases the tube voltage.
<p>
Here are the 5517B HeNe laser tube parameters as best I have been able
to determine them so far, compared with typical short barcode scanner HeNe
laser tubes.  Except for tube voltage (which I haven't measured and am only
estimating) and tube current (which is always spec'd to be 3.5 mA),
the parameters for the 5517B are for one very healthy sample.  The total
length, planar HR mirror, divergence (without beam expander), and beam
diameter are similar or identical for other models.  The parameters
for the barcode scanner tube are for a range of typical models.
The divergence for a particular model barcode scanner tube is
usually achieved by either the specific curvature of the outer
surface of the OC mirror glass or with an external lens glued
to it, but the cavity design including the OC RoC (radius of
curvature) is the same for all.

<p>
Of note here is the relatively low OC reflectance of 98.5 percent.  This
is one of the primary parameters that determins the REF frequency.  All
other factors being equal, reducing the reflectance increases cavity
loss which increases the REF frequency.
<p>
<A HREF="hp5517m1.gif">Plot of Hewlett Packard Model 5517C Stabilized Laser
During Warmup</A> shows how a typical 5517 laser behaves.  This is a
5517C rather than a 5517A but the locking algorithm is the same.  Note that
the entire warmup period from laser on to locked is only around 3.5 minutes
because of the internal location of the heater for the active mode as noted
above.  A laser with the more common external heater could take 20 minutes or
more to lock.  The control algorithm is a bit more sophisticated than
used on some other stabilized lasers, checking periodically for the status,
and switching from "Warmup Mode" to "Optical Mode" about half way through
the warmup period, at which point the READY LED starts flashing.  A short
while after it locks is when the READY LED comes on solid.
<p>
<A HREF="hp5517m2.gif">Plot of Hewlett Packard Model 5517C Stabilized Laser
Near End of Warmup</A> shows the 5 mode cycles just before locking  
and the final transition to the locked state.  The peculiar shape of these
Zeeman-split modes is clearly evident in this expanded view.
<p>
The beat frequency is shown for the last 5 cycles and after locking
in both these plots.  This is the actual measured frequency captured along
with the vertically and horizontally polarized modes and total output power.
(Showing the frequency plot earlier would be a mess.)  The beat only appears
for a small percentage of the mode cycles with some variation during the time
it is present, peaking when the F1 and F2 amplitudes are equal, and only when
F1 is falling with increasing temperature.  There is no beam when F1 and F2
are equal but F2 is rising with increasing temperature.  The reason for this
becomes evident from the simplified diagram in
<A HREF="zeemode1.gif">Axial Zeeman Split HeNe Laser Mode Behavior</A>,
or more accurately in <A HREF="zeemode2.gif">HP-5517 Zeeman Split HeNe
Laser Mode Behavior</A>.  The second diagram has been specifically crafted
based on the mode plots, above, and thus more accurately represents the
actual mode behavior of the 5517.
Both show 5 snapshots of most of a mode sweep cycle starting with
the cavity being 1/4 wavelength too short at the top and ending with
being 1/8 wavlength too long.  (The case of 1/4 wavelength too long
would be the same as the first, 1/4 wavelength too short).  Only when
the longitudinal mode is centered between the Zeeman-split neon gain
curves will there be a beat.  In addition, the mode amplitudes
are changing rapidly as the cavity expands at those high slope
locations on the gain curves.  When the cavity
length changes (longer or shorter) by 1/4 of the lasing wavelength
of approximately 633 nm, the amplitudes are again equal, but the two
separate longitudinal modes are oscillating far apart and there is
no beat.  Note that the red and blue plots include the F1 and F2
amplitudes, but also may have contributions from other longitudinal
modes derived from the same split gain curve which thus have the
same original circular polarization.
<p>
Note that as the tube ages with use, the gain declines and the width
of each gain curve that is above the lasing threshold decreases.
Eventually, with a really high mileage tube, there may be no overlap
at all and the beam will probably disappear for a part of the mode
sweep cycle.  But it is exactly at that point where the Zeeman beat would
be generated, so it will also disappear entirely.  Lasers are generally
taken out of service long before this happens, but I recently found one
whose output power was so low that this behavior was present - or absent
depending on your point of view!
<p>
Here is how the article "An Instant-On Laser for Length Measurement"
by Glenn M .Burgwald and William P. Krugein describes the operation of
the laser tube in the <A HREF=
"http://hparchive.com/Journals/Low-Resolution/HPJ-1970-08-Low-Resolution.pdf">
Hewlett-Parckard Journal, Aug., 1970</A>.
<p>
<blockquote>
"If an axial magnetic field is applied to a laser which is free from
 polarization anisotropy in either the mirrors or the plasma tube, the
 output splits into two frequencies of left and right circular polarization.
 First-order theory predicts that the frequency splitting is
 proportional to magnetic field strength and to the ratio of line Q to cavity
 Q. In the new laser, magnetic field strength is adjusted for a difference
 frequency of about 2.0 MHz. Line center is virtually midway between the
 displaced lines, so proper cavity tuning can be assured by adjusting for
 equal intensities of the lines."
</blockquote>
<p>
And they show a gain curve diagram even simpler than the one above.
See that article for more details.
<p>
The reason for the peculiar shape of the mode plot is not
clear.  It is probably due to a combination of Zeeman modes and normal
longitudinal modes.  However, the gain profiles need to be asymmetric
to account for it.  The simpified explanation of Zeeman splitting
rarely takes into account the actual profile of the magnetic field
which no doubt stretches and distorted the gain profiles.  So, 
drawing a pair of nice bell-shaped gain curves really isn't accurate.
Near the ends of the tube, there will be little magnetic field and the
gain curve there will not be shifted very much.  In the center, the
field will be maximum and the gain curves will be shifted by
a large amount.  Thus, the neon atoms will see a variation in
magnetic field along the bore - a summation or integral of
gain curves varying with frequency.  This is depicted in
<A HREF="zeemode2.gif">HP-5517 Zeeman Split HeNe Laser Mode Behavior</A>.
Here, the gain curves have been modified so that the results would
be roughly similar to what was in the plots, above.
And <A HREF="hp5517m3.gif">HP-5517 Zeeman Split HeNe Laser Mode Behavior Versus
Mode Position on Gain Curve</A> shows one complete mode cycle along with
little split gain curves.
<p>
Note that the locked mode amplitudes are not equal and that the locked
beat frequency varies a bit after locking and does not stay at its maximum
value as would be expected if the stabilization was optimal.  This is
not a quirk of the particular laser I'm using for these experiments
as I've tested dozens with similar behavior.   So, they aren't as perfect
as we might hope! :)
<p>
Also note the two smaller modes on the tails of the gain curves in the
diagrams.  They aren't present in all of these lasers.  But if they are
and align with the X and Y axes, then the only effect will be to slightly
decrease the MEAS or detected REF signal level with respect to laser
output power.  However, if the are not aligned with the X and Y axes (e.g.,
at 30 degrees), they will cause level changes in the envelope of the
signal from the optical receiver's photodiode due to self-interference
in the interferometer.  This is similar to what would happen if the primary
Zeeman modes were misaligned, or not pure.  The consequences could be
transient position errors but only during motion.  The end-points would
be accurate.
<p>
Some later versions of the 5517 lasers have a totally redesigned electronics
board with more digital circuitry.  I don't know exactly when this changeover
took place, or whether it's simply a special option, but several 5517Cs and
5517Ds from before 2000 had the old style and a 5517C from 2005 had the new
style.  So, perhaps Agilent insisted on reinventing the wheel. :)
<p>
The glass 5517A HeNe laser tube itself is similar or identical to that of
the 5501B.  However, the tube's enclosure appears to have been
cost-reduced: It is a base metal casting rather than being constructed
from precision machined parts.  (This is also true of the 5518A and 5519A/B.)
All the other 5517s use tube enclosures that
are physically similar to that of the 5501B.  (Perhaps newer versions of the
5517A have the higher quality construction.)
<p>
The output optics consists of
a beam expander/collimator (the black and silver object just to the left
of the power supply danger label) and an additional optical assembly to
the left of this whose front and rear halves contain what appear to be
AR coated optical quality mica pelicles oriented at slight, but
different angles.  The front and rear sections can be rotated independently
and they were sealed with blue paint once the perfect orientations were found.
The two mica (or whatever) pieces of the optics assembly (just after the
beam expander) are adjustable waveplates.  The first one is a 1/4 waveplate
to convert the circular polarization of the Zeeman split output of
the HeNe laser tube to linear polarization and the second one is a
1/2 waveplate to rotate the resulting linearly polarized components
to be aligned along the horizontal and vertical axes.  These can then be
separated out with a polarizing beamsplitter at the detectors.
<p>
The HP/Agilent lasers do not employ any sophisticated method of stabilization
such as locking the Zeeman beat frequency (which chances slightly depending on
where the modes are on the neon gain curve) to a crystal reference.
They simply use the amplitudes of two orthogonally polarized signals
in an analog feedback circuit as is common with most other stabilized
HeNe lasers.  However, here, the two polarizations are of the two Zeeman split
components of the single oscillating mode rather than two separate
longitudinal modes.  The error signal is the difference between their
amplitudes, which is forced to zero by temperature tuning of
the cavity.  And, in fact, there is no real need to have
the frequency be precisely known or even constant over the long term,
as long as it is stable over the short term.  More below.
<p>
The warmup/locking algorithm is straightforward, though just a bit different
than used in many other stabilized lasers.  When the laser is first
turned on, it is in "Warmup Mode" and the heater, which is wrapped around the
internal bore of the laser tube, is driven to reach a fixed temperature (set
by the only pot on the electronics PCB).  The temperature is sensed by
periodically measuring the heater's resistance.  This is done by disabling
the heater driver, passing a small fixed current through heater wire
(for 2.56 seconds out of each 25.6 second period), and storing the
resulting voltage in a sample-and-hold.  Since
the heater wire changes resistance with temperature, this eliminates the
need for a separate temperature sensor inside the tube.  Once the
temperature set-point is reached (the voltage from the pot approaches
the voltage on the sample-and-hold), the feedback switches to Optimal Mode
and alternately samples the two polarized Zeeman split
sub-mode signals with their voltage difference being the error signal in the
feedback loop, which is driven to zero by adjusting the temperature,
and thus cavity length.   In fact, from the relative shapes
of the red and blue mode cycles, it can be seen that from
about the last half dozen mode cycles till just before locking, the tube
is actully steadily cooling rather than heating.
With the heater located inside the laser
tube, the time from power on to a locked condition is typically
only about 4 minutes and should also be less susceptible to
ambient conditions.  In fact, from the relative shapes
of the red and blue mode cycles, it can be seen that during most of
the time from power on (a cold start) to lock, the laser tube is heating
(about 75 cycles), but it switches to steady cooling (about 6 cycles) just
before locking.

<h4><A NAME="hst5517e">Agilent 5517E/F/G</A></h4>

The primary evidence of the existence of a 5517E is that I have one. :)
Actually, I've also seen options lists for the 5517E and 5517FL,
and have heard that there is also a 5517G!  None of these are documented
on the Agilent Web site and all the major Web search engines
including Google come up empty-handed.  This laser is in the gold
case, so perhaps it is only available as an OEM or "military calibrated"
product?  It runs at 6.3 MHz so the listed range above of 5.5 to 6.5 MHz is
just a guess based on the only spec I have for the 5517E - 1.6 m/s maximum
velocity.  This is much higher than the 5517D's maximum of 4 MHz resulting
in over a 50 percent greater velocity measurement capability.  I didn't
even think it was possible to build a Zeeman laser at much more than 4 MHz.
The tube assembly looks almost identical to all the others except that it
is about 0.75" shorter up front beyond the section with the magnet and the
glass tube itself may be as much as 1.5" shorter - 6.5" compared to 8".
The shorter tube suggests a shorter cavity length needed to suppress
rogue longitudinal modes.  This likely means the magnetic field is stronger
and thus the total extent of the Zeeman-split neon gain curve is wider.
The back-end is enclosed in a plastic cover, reason unknown.  Another
anomoly is a lack of a label on the tube, so Agilent can deny any knowledge
of its existence. :)
<p>
Several views of a naked 5517E are shown in
<A HREF="5517e-c1.jpg">Agilent 5517E Laser Head With Cover Removed</A>.
<p>
The 5517E has the most incredibly complicated Control PCB of any HP/Agilent
laser I had see before finding this laser, even compared to the newer
digital Control PCB (see below).  (I've since found a similar control PCB
in a recent vintage 5517D.)  It includes
a SHARC DSP, two Lattice FPLDs, and a lot of other digital
circuitry, purpose unknown.  They also seem to have gone back to PWM
for the heater drive since there is no power transistor on a heatsink,
as with the original analog and first digital Control PCBs.  However,
that collection of inductors visible in the lower left of the photo may
be there to clean up the drive to the heater and remove the high frequency
switching noise.  Since the locking should be basically the same as
for the other lasers, this level of complexity is perplexing unless this
particular unit was designed to have much better stability -
perhaps the "military calibrated" version.  Unfortunately, the new Control PCB
lacks all the familiar jumpers and the temperature set-point pot, and adds a
couple of micro DIP-switches and connectors, purpose also unknown.  Aside from
the unknowns, everything else is obvious. :)
<p>
Here are a pair of closeup photos of the overall laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="5517pcb3.jpg">Agilent 5517E Laser Digital Control PCB</A>.
 This is basically the view from the right side.
 The 4 status LEDs are just above and to the left of the Lattice part.  A quad
 micro-DIP switch is just above them.  There is another QFP of similar
 size to the Lattice part on the back side of the PCB, along with many
 more SMT ICs and discrete components.  I have since found an identical
 Control PCB in a 5517D-C29, manufactured in 2004.  This was from a wafer
 fab, apparently used interchangeably with 5517Ds having analog control
 PCBs.  Unlike in the 5517E, only the Control PCB was different, everything
 else was physically identical to that of the normal 5517B/C/D.
 So, again, no clear justification for the extreme complexity,
 other than to make non-Agilent servicing more difficult.
<p>
 High resolution scans of the front and back of a similar digital control
 PCB can be found linked from the section:
 <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517l">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Construction</A>.
<p>
<li><A HREF="5517e-ls.jpg">Agilent 5517E Laser Head - Left Side</A>.  Note
 the slightly shorter tube, the additional sheet metal shroud with the
 ballast resistor tied to it at the top, and the aluminum cover under
 the tube - which doesn't seem to have anything inside of it but does
 raise the tube a mm or so which is consistent with the difference in
 height between the normal and "L" versions of these lasers.  So this
 should be a 5517EL, not 5517E!  The reason is not known but
 it might have something to do with channeling air-flow as the HeNe laser
 power supply is also raised slightly off the baseplate and there were
 ventilation holes and an obvious location for a fan in the cover as with
 the "L" versions lasers.
<p>
 There is also an additional resistor in series with the tube heater in
 the wire bundle, apparently as an afterthought since it is part of a
 cable extension.  The heater and resistor each measure just under 5 ohms
 cold.  The heater of other 5517 tubes measures about 8 ohms cold, so at
 the same current, this shorter tube which must have a shorter heater gets
 only slightly over half the heater power.  I originally thought that this
 might be why it takes longer to stabilize, but then found that this was
 true of "normal" 5517 tubes with the fancy digital Control PCB.
 That shroud above the tube would make tube
 swaps much more tedious, as the Control PCB on the opposite side would
 need to come off to remove it.  Then, the cable ties would have to be
 cut to free the wiring and tube.  But  at least the connector PCB is
 identical to the ones in the 5517B/C/D lasers, and even includes the
 usual appendix - the HeNe laser current adjust pot that is no longer used!
<p>
<li><A HREF="5517e-t1.jpg">Agilent 5517E Laser Tube Assembly - Rear View</A>
 The anode connection is to the metal cylinder with hole attached
 with a glass-to-metal seal.  Compare this with the lsaer tube found in the
 5517A/B/C/D such as <A HREF="hp5517ta.jpg">Tube Used in HP-5517B Two-Frequency
 HeNe Laser - View 1</A>.  They all have glass at the end with a spring to
 keep the mirror in place, and the anode connection in a side feed-through
 an inch or so forward.  The only explanation for this change is to
 get bore discharge as close to the rear mirror as possible to extract
 every last bit of gain from what must be a very short tube.  This also
 explains the plastic cover - an insulator for the high voltage!
<p>
 With no label on the tube assembly and that unusual plastic rear cover,
 for awhile I was suspecting that this might not even an HP/Agilent tube.
 But that style of glasswork at the back is clearly HP/Agilent even if it
 does differ slightly from the normal design.  And everything else is
 normal HP/Agilent including the beam expander, HeNe laser power supply
 wiring/ballast, and the Newest Digital Control PCB, which, as noted, has
 turned up on a late model 5517D.  However, there were some mica washers
 under the tube presumably as shims to fine tune the vertical position
 of the beam, so this may have been a prototype or pre-production model.
 While there is no manufacturing date on the laser, date codes on the ICs
 suggest that is from around 2003.  Rework in the area of the REF out
 circuitry may mean this was an early version of the Newest Digital Control
 PCB.  This is not present in my other sample.
<p>
 And a further note about disassembly: To get this photo required almost
 totally removing the tube since the rear plastic cap was held in place by
 three screws with nuts and it would have been almost impossible to replace
 the nuts without being able to access behind and under the magnet assembly.
 That's when I discovered the shims.  Hopefully, I got them back more or less
 in the proper locations.  Must maintain specifications! :)
</ul>
<p>
Functionally, the 5517E behaves more or less like the other 5517 lasers.
The user LEDs are the same but there are 4 LEDs on the control board that
I'm sure provide a wealth of information if one knows how to interpret
them.  My sample takes over 5 minutes for READY to start flashing.
READY also stops flashing once or twice for a couple minutes, before
it resumes flashing, and then locks after about 9 minutes.  Whether these
long times and peculiar flashing behavior are normal or indicate some
problem, is also unknown.  However, with a similar Control PCB and heslthy
5517B tube, the behavior is similarly strange.  More on this in the sections:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517w">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Control PCBs and
Locking Sequence</A> and <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517r">Agilent
5517 Laser RS232 Communications</A>.
<p>
The tube is somewhat low power compared to what's normal for other
5517s - about 120 &micro;W locked.  But I have no specs
on 5517E minimum output power, so with the shorter tube and likely
stronger magnetic field, that might be acceptable.  Once locked,
it's quite stable with minimal drift in REF frequency.  Given the
huge amount of computation power available, it may count mode sweep cycles
instead of using a temperature set-point (or in addition), and might
also adapt automagically to a replacement tube - or require a factory
upload of tube parameters via one of those unlabeled connectors!
<p>
The high REF frequency of 6.3 MHz works fine with my home-built SGMD1
measurement display, but comes up as "Laser Fail" on a 5508A.  This isn't
all that surprising since 6.3 MHz is almost twice the maximum REF frequency
of the 5518A for which the 5508A was intended.  However, the same type of
control PCB with a 5517B tube locks fine but also fails keep the the 5508A
happy, so it is more likely due to wimpy line drivers or something like
that. :)

<h4><A NAME="hst5517l">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Construction</A></h4>

The following also applies to the 5518A and the 5519A/B, though I rather
doubt that they have equivalent digital Control PCBs like the 5517s.
<p>
These lasers consist of the laser tube assembly, potted (brick) HeNe laser
power supply, beam sampler, connector PCB, and Control PCB. mounted on a
an metal chassis.  Any of the parts can be replaced in under 5 minutes
using common tools, with only minimal or no adjustment or alignment.
<p>
<b>Laser tube assembly:</b>
<p>
All of these consist of the actual glass HeNe laser tube potted with some
sort of rubbery material inside its
Zeeman magnet, beam expander, and adjustable waveplates.  The heater/cathode
is attached via a 2 pin plug while the anode has its own single pin high
voltage connector.  The HeNe laser tube ballast resistance of about 100K
ohms is conformal molded into the silicone insulated HV cable.  The
bifilar-wound heater inside the laser tube has a typical resistance (cold)
of 8 ohms on all tubes except the 5517E.  When at operating temperature,
the resistance is spec'd to be 1.285 times what it is when cold.  For
the 5517E (and possibly the F and G models as well), the resistance
(cold) is around 4 ohms.
<p>
Only 4 screws hold the tube assembly to the chassis for lasers in the
small cases (all the 5517s except the 5517A, as well as the 5501B).  One or
two will be flat head screws which provide either a fixed axis for horizontal
(pan) alignment, or self alignment (no adjustment permitted).  All of these
tube assemblies appear physically identical, except for the 5517E (and probably
5517F/G) which are slightly shorter.  (They, of course, differ with respect
to the REF/split frequency.)  The larger tube assemblies found in
the 5517A, 5518A, and 5519A/B mount with 3 bolts and have machined alignment
pins so no adjustments are needed or possible.  They, too, are physically
identical except for one small area of the casting that needs to be cut
away if installing a 5517A tube into a 5519A/B laser.
<p>
<b>HeNe laser power supply:</b>
<p>
Very old (perhaps roughly pre-1990) lasers used
<A HREF="http://www.laserdrive.com/">Laser Drive</A> model 111-Adj-1
HeHe laser power supplies which had adjustable current via a pot on the
laser connector PCB.  At least most of them did.  I did find one that
had the same part number but no third wire.  All later versions use
<A HREF="http://www.voltagemultipliers.com/">VMI</A> power supplies with
a fixed current of 3.5 mA.  However, the pot is still present on the connector
PCB even on lasers made after 2006 (and probably to the present day),
but does nothing.
<p>
There are three versions of the VMI power supplies used in these lasers.
The two older ones (VMI PS 148 and VMI PS 217) have the same HP part number
of 0950-0470.  The switchover came around the year 2000.
The newest one (VMI PS 373) has an Agilent part number
of 0950-4459 and is found on all recent lasers, at least since 2004.
I know that going from the 148 to the 217 reduced the
residual current ripple from over 3 percent to less than 1 percent because
I measured it.  I do not know what changes were made in the 373,
nor what other differences there may be between these models.
VMI claims it is proprietary information.  Can you believe that? :)
However, I have de-potted a dead model 373 and have reverse engineered
its schematic.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscvmi1">VMI 373
HeNe Laser Power Supply</A>.
<p>
With few exceptions, the only defective power supplies I've ever found in HP
lasers were nearly all Laser Drive 111-Adj-1s.  And one type of failure may
result in the adjustment pot having no effect with the power supply pumping
way excessive current (like 6 or 8 mA) through the tube.  With luck, the
ballast resistor catches fire and explodes before the tube is damaged. :( :)  
One exception was a VMI PS 148 that had excessive ripple, so something in
its output filter had blown.  But if I hadn't been checking ripple on a bunch
of these power supplies, it probably would have gone unnoticed, since as
long as the tube stays lit, performance of the laser probably wouldn't be
affected in any significant way.  However, the additional ripple would make
the effective dropout current go up, so a reasonably healthy tube might start
sputtering on that supply.
<p>
<b>Beam sampler:</b>
<p>
These consist of a first non-polarizing angled plate to sample a portion of
the output beam and a second non-polarizing angled plate to take this and
split it between the LCD switch, and reference photodiode.  The LCD switch
attaches to the Control PCB via a 4 pin connector - 2 pins for the LCD
drive and 2 pincs for the photodiode behind it.  The reference photodiode
is actually mounted on the Control PCB and simply pokes its head into the
beam sampler assembly.  Beam samplers for all model lasers appear to be
identical and interchangeable.
<p>
<b>Connector PCB:</b>
<p>
Aside from the Mil-style connector to the outside world and the 24 pin
connector to the Control PCB, this has some filter capacitors; fuses
for +15 VDC and -15 VDC; and the Power, Laser On (really same as Power),
and READY LEDs.  The one pot does nothing except for really old lasers
with the Laser Drive 111-Adj-1 HeNe laser power supply brick.
<p>
Very old lasers had a case interlock switch to disable the laser tube from
being power if the covers were removed, and a service switch to override
this. :)  Both of these switches have been eliminated, though the PCB pads
and wiring for them are still present, but bypassed.
<p>
<b>Control PCB:</b>
<p>
Since the introduction of the 5517A laser through the early 2000s,
all the Control PCBs in these lasers were based on simple TTL logic
for timing and an analog feedback loop.  The one in the 5517A
is physically larger and not interchangeable with
those in the small lasers, but is nearly identical electrically.  The main
functional difference is the additiona of circuitry and a connector so it
can also be used in 5518A and 5519A/B lasers.  There had been virtually no
change in the design over 15 years or more, except that a modification to
the internal REF receiver makes newer lasers require somewhat higher
optical power to lock than older ones.
<p>
But since sometime after Agilent was created, at least two versions of a
Control PCB with much more complex digital circuitry appeared.  These still
have a substantial number of analog parts like op-amps and comparators,
but FPGAs/FPLDs and/or a reasonably high performance microprocessor or DSP
have replaced discrete logic.  If one wants to count transistors, I bet
the digital Control PCBs have 1000 times the
number of transistors as the Analog Control PCB!
The PCBs are also almost entirely surface mount, with parts on both
sides (at least for the newest version).
<p>
The first of these digital Control PCBs (which I call the "newer digital
control PCB) is electrically and physically
interchangeable with the older Analog Control PCBs.  It
is based on a Xilinx FPGA and should be very reliable.
But a failure for any reason other than an obvious problem like a blown fuse
bad DC regulator with no underlying cause would likely render it
non-repairable except by Agilent or an authorized service center since
it's then just a black box with no real way to easily troubleshoot.  A
service manual may exist but I've never seen one.  And even if it did,
sophisticated test equipment and a surface mount rework station
would be required to have any chance at repair.  However, this version
has all the same jumpers and temperature set pot, so normal testing and
adjustment is similar to that of the Analog Control PCB.  The solution
would then be to simply swap in a known good board (either version).
<p>
It's not clear what, if anything, the digital controller adds to the laser,
other than to make it more proprietary and difficult to service.  After all,
features are not being constantly changed or added, nor will there be
security issues due to computer viruses - it doesn't run
Windows! :)  So, periodic firmware upgrades and bug fixes really aren't
required.  Whether this digital Control PCB is now used for all
Agilent 5517B/C/D lasers or only for those with "military calibration"
or OEM or special requests, I do not know.  Swapping in an analog
Control PCB resulted in no obvious differences in performance, which
would be my suggested method of repair unless there were special
requirements.  And now (2009) 5517B lasers with these digital Control PCBs
have been turning up from 2004, 2005, and 2006, probably removed from
service in wafer fabs after degrading to the edge of Agilent specs
for REF frequency, or a specific number or hours of service.
<p>
All the jumpers and their approximate locations are identical and the time
spent in the major states and time to lock (READY on solid) are about the
same as with the Analog Control PCB.  The behavior while warming up and after
locking is indistinguishable from that of the Analog Control PCB so it really
isn't even possible to determine which one is inside the laser without removing
the cover.  The only obviously similar electronic component common to the
two is the large white film capacitor for the feedback integrator, and
perhaps the heater driver transistor.  It's possible that the objective
of this redesign was simply to eiliminate all the older SSI/MSI TTL
logic and other obsolete through-hole parts, but that it is
functionally identical to the Analog Control PCB with
essentially the same logic inside the Xilinx FPGA and linear circuitry in
SMT ICs.
<p>
More recently, another type of digital Control PCB has appeared.  I first
found one in a 5517E (this model laser isn't documented anywhere) and thought
it might be unique to the -E version.  But I have since also seen one in a
5517D-C29, manufactured in 2004.  (And one of the other type of Digital
Control PCB also in 2004.)  This "Newest Digital Control PCB" seems to
be a total redesign, with no effort made to be at all similar to the
Analog Control PCB with its jumpers and test points.
<p>
Here are the three types of Control PCBs used in the 5517B/C/D/E lasers.
<p>

 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
(As noted, the one in the 5517A differs slightly and as far as I know,
only comes in the original analog version.)
<p>
The Analog Control PCB and the Newer Digital Control PCB function in a
virtually identical manner, requiring about 2 minutes for the READY LED to
start flashing, and another 2 minutes to come on solid.  And as noted, they
also have more or less the same jumpers and testpoints, as well as the
temperature set-point pot.  The Newer Digital Control PCB may in fact
simply be essentially an emulation of the Analog Control PCB using an
FPGA and more modern surface mount parts.
<p>
There are no useful indicators on the Analog Control PCB.
<p>
The third type of control PCB is not at all similar to the others.  It
has none of the same jumpers and several different testpoints, no pots, an
RS232 port no doubt for setup and testing and almost certainly a
digitally-maintained run-time meter, another unused connector, and a
large unpopulated header.  There are also a pair of micro-DIP switches -
and a pushbutton, which I fianally dared to push, and as expected,
seems to be master reset. :)  There are many SMT
parts on the back side of the PCB, including another
Lattice FPLD.
<p>
For more, on the Control PCBs and their operation, see the sections:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517w">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Control PCBs and Locking
Sequence</A>, <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517e">HP-5517E/F</A>, and
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517r">Agilent 5517 Laser RS232 Communications</A>.
<p>
The entire purpose of redesigning the controller more than once is somewhat
perplexing.  Doing it the second time with such complex digital hardware
seems totally nuts, unless it was actually done for some custom high
performance application, and it was simply convenient to use in late
model 5517 lasers.  (Given the likely relatively high cost of components
including the SHARC processor and Lattice FPLDs, I
find this rather hard to believe though.  And it's a multilayer PCB with
components on both sides, additional connectors, and other stuff.)
The same very limited inputs (a pair of photodiodes sensing the
modes through the relatively slow speed LCD switch and another photodiode
behind a polarizer generating the REF signal) and outputs (tube heater
current) are used in all 5517 lasers so it wouldn't seem to be possible
to implement a significantly higher level of frequency accuracy or
stabilization no matter what sort of control scheme is used.  About
the only thing that might be done is to actually compute the REF
frequency from the REF photodiode signal and fine tune the lock
position to maximize it once the basic stabilization using
mode balance has been achieved.  The peak of the REF frequency
function optical frequency may be a more accurate means of locating
the Zeeman-split gain curve center.  But except for NIST-level precision,
the analog method is really just fine, so even if this scheme is
implement, it's not clear what customers would require it.  And from
my observations of the REF frequency while locking, it doesn't seem to
make any effort to maximize it, but stabilizes at a point much lower than
the peak, with the same sort of slow variation once locked as the analog
Control PCB.
<p>
So, a combination of several explanations make the most sense:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Components used on the Analog Control PCB were likely becoming obsolete
 so that some (though likely trivial) redesign would have been needed
 in any event.
<p>
<li>Basing the controller on a digital platform makes it easy to set up
 and test in the factory.  Those extra connectors must have a purpose!
 (And we now know that one is for the RS232 port.)
<p>
<li>Basing the controller on a digital platform makes it virtually impossible
 for anyone other than Agilent to repair or adjust (such as when a laser
 tube is replaced).  The RS232 port is no doubt part of this, though the
 unidentified connector next to it probably provides additional status
 information.  Of course, with the amount of computing power on this
 thing, it should be able to determine the relevant parameters of any laser
 tube without any need for calibration (and predict the weather at the same
 time!).
<p>
<li>Digital anything is "in" and the complex appearance helps to justify
 the five figure price tag. :-)

<h4><A NAME="hst5517w">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Control PCBs and Locking Sequence</A></h4>

The stabilization technique used with 5517 lasers is really dirt simple: Start
by heating the "mirror spacing rod" to a set-point temperature, fine tune the
temperature, then switch to optical feedback which forces the two orthogonal
Zeeman-split polarized modes to be equal.  However, the details vary slightly
depending on the specific Control PCB used in the laser.
<p>
<b>Locking sequence with Analog Control PCB:</b>
<p>
This also applies to the 5518A and 5519A/B since they all use the 5517A
Analog Control PCB.  It is also generally applicable to the 5501B though
some details differ slightly.
<p>
From power-on to READY takes around 4 minutes for most 5517 lasers -
all those NOT using the Newest Digital Control PCB.  Even on the original
Analog Control PCB, a state machine based on counters, flip-flops, and
gates determines the timing.  This may be true of the Newer Digital
Control PCB as well, except that the state machine would be inside a
Xilinx FPGA.  Who knows how the Newest Digital Control PCB with its
SHARC CPU implements this algorithm (which tends to take much longer
than 4 minutes, reason unknown)!  The following is paraphrased
from the 5517A manual, which assumes the Analog Control PCB
implementation.  (All timing is approximate as the main clock
is a 555 timer on the Analog Control PCB!):
<p>
<ul>
<li>When power is first applied, the laser enters "WARMUP" mode where the
 heater wrapped around the mirror spacing rod inside the laser tube is
 turned full on for 23.04 seconds out of each 25.6 second period.  The
 temperature of the rod is sampled during the remaining
 2.56 seconds by disabling the heater and applying a fixed current through
 the heater coil so that its resistance can be determined by sensing the
 voltage drop.  The set-point is where the resistance has increased by
 a factor of 1.285 compared to its value at the ambient temperature at
 which it was initially adjusted.  I don't know the composition of
 the heater wire but it is magnetic and soft, so possibly iron.  It's
 temperature coefficient of resistances is 0.005866/&deg;C
 resulting in a temperature rise of about 49 &deg;C.  The time
 in WARMUP mode is typically
 90 seconds but will be affected by the actual ambient temperature and
 temperature set-point.  It is somewhat longer for the 5501B and 5517 lasers
 using the Newest Digital Control PCB.
<p>
<li>When the rod temperature gets close to the set-point temperature,
 the state machine enters "HEATER QUALIFIED" mode.  The READY LED starts
 flashing.
<p>
<li>The state machine delays 100 seconds to allow adequate
 time for the temperature to be fine tuned to match the set-point
 temperature.
<p>
<li>The laser then enters "OPTICAL" mode and switches control of the heater
 to the optical feedback loop using the difference in mode amplitudes from the
 LCD and its subtracting sample-and-hold.  The actual time to the point
 where the laser is actually locked to a particular pair of modes and
 reasonably stable may occur as early as within a few seconds of entering
 OPTICAL mode, but could take much longer due to the low speed sampling
 of the LCD.  If the modifications described in the next section are
 implemented, it will be very short.
<p>
<li>The state machine waits 50 seconds and then enables the reference output
 (REF).  If the difference frequency signal is present and of sufficient
 amplitude that REF is generated as indicated by "REFON" being asserted by the
 internal optical receiver, the laser enters the "LOCKED" state and the READY
 LED turns on solid.  If no REF output is present, the READY LED goes
 off for 1.28 seconds, and the laser returns to "WARMUP" mode to try again.
 External equipment like the 5508A Laser Measurement Display use the presence
 of REF to indicate that the laser is ready.
</ul>
<p>
Thus, under normal conditions, the laser will be locked and ready to make a
measurement (approximately) 150 seconds after the READY LED starts flashing.
Note that the only check to make sure the laser is locked is that the REF
signal is present.  Since this only occurs for a small percentage of the
entire longitudinal mode sweep cycle, REF will not remain on for long without
active feedback, so this is a reliable test.  The laser will in fact continue
to repeat the above sequence forever if REFON is not detected.  Typically,
this will occur when the output power from the laser tube has declined to
below the REF detection threshold of the internal optical receiver after
years of hard work.  However, some marginal lasers will go through the
sequence several times when powered up as the output power from the laser
tube gradually increases with warmup until the amplitude of the difference
frequency signal exceeds the REF detection threshold.
<p>
<b>Locking sequence with Newer Digital Control PCB:</b>
<p>
The Newer Digital Control PCB has 3 yellow state LEDs near the top
right corner of the large Xilinx chip.  These provide some information about
where the controller is in the warmup process and they have a 1:1
correspondance with the major modes of the Analog Control PCB.  I'm not sure
the times in each state are identical for the two but they are close.  Here
is a rough chart of their behavior for a normal 5517C laser:

            The previous two entries repeat approximately 9 times.

   3:58      ON     000     (LASER READY)
</PRE>
<p>
The blink rate for READY is about 1.5 Hz.
<p>
<b>Locking sequence with Newest Digital Control PCB:</b>
<p>
The Newest Digital Control PCB seems to go through many more gyrations during
warmup than either of the others, including several times where READY flashes
multiple times separated by a period of inactivity, and then finally flashing
READY continuously for two minutes until it locks - the latter being
similar to what the Analog Control PCB does.  The entire process
consistently takes much longer than the 4 minutes typical of a
laser with the Analog Control PCB, up to 10 minutes or more.  The
behavior is not obviously different whether a weak (but functional)
laser tube, or one that greatly exceeds minimun output power specs
is used, though it may take slightly longer with a below-spec tube.
After all this, the end result seems to be exactly the same.
<p>
Here is a chart of the typical startup behavior for a very healthy
5517B tube installed in a (previously) 5517D laser with this newest digital
Control PCB:

<p>
The State refers to the 4 SMT LEDs above the upper left corner of the
Lattice chip near the center of the PCB.  The MSB is green while the
three LSBs are red.  All times are approximate.  "Flash" is just
the briefest pulse of light.  "Flash n" denotes "n"
flashes at a 1 Hz rate with a 50 percent duty cycle
The duration for the 1110,0000 state changes in each "Flash n" sequence
is relatively short (perhaps 100 ms for each of the two states).
The minimum value for "n" seems to be 5, but it tends to increase
as the laser warms up.  (I'm not positive it's monotonically increasing
though.)  Once the REF frequency can be sustained by the feedback loop,
it continues flashing for 32 seconds, and then switches to state 0111
for 96 seconds prior to becoming READY.  Until
that time, the READY LED and the MSB state
bit track each other almost perfectly.  But then, the MSB state
bit (1000) continues to flash (but now at about a 1.2 Hz rate)
while the READY LED remains on solid,  And there is just a hint
of the 0100 state bit flickering dimly, possibly
the actual feedback loop in operation. :)
<p>
Multiple runs from a cold start may differ slightly in the number of
"Flash n" sequences and the values of n, as well as other details,
but always take much more than 4 minutes (typical of the analog
Control PCB).  The very healthy tube will lock in 7 to 9 minutes while
a weak but usable one might take 11 minutes or more.  In all cases
where the laser successfully locks, the last two minutes will be
identical in behavior to that of the other two Control PCBs with READY
flashing continuously until it stays on solid.  A tube that is
very weak or with no detectable beat (REF) frequency will result
in only occasional very short abortive flashes,
and no conclusion (at least not in 15 or 20 minutes).
<p>
One annoying difference between this Control PCB and the others is that
the signal level for REF and ~REF seems to be much lower - about 2 V p-p
open circuit and less than 1 V (maybe as low as 0.5 V p-p) terminated, instead
of more than 5 V p-p, and the 5508A display apparently doesn't accept
this as a valid signal.  So even if the laser comes READY within 10
minutes (the maximum allowed by the 5508A), it still comes up as "Laser Fail",
which isn't recoverable without power cycling the 5508A (which means
the laser as well if it receives DC power from the 5508A).
However, my home-built SGMD1 display has no problemss. :)  I wouldn't
be at all surprised to learn that the signal levels are programmable -
somehow.
<p>
Here is a chart of the typical startup behavior for the 5517E with its similar
Newest Digital Control PCB.  The tube is probably below the Agilent spec for
minimum power, but locks without problems so the sequence of event is
probably not affected singificantly:

The last part of the sequence is essentially identical to that of the other
laser, but the initial behavior differs significantly.  This one appears
to keep track of the mode cycles, or at least flash the State LEDs
in response to them! "Mode n" denotes "n" times where the Zeeman beat
is on, at least momentarily.  Also note that
the READY LED only tracks the MSB State bit near the end.  I assume that
the AM29F040B (4 Mbit flash memory) is the firmware NVRAM but there is
no version number so I don't know that they differ, but they must as
everything else on the two digital Control PCBs appears identical
including the DIP-switch settings.
<p>
For more on the 5517 laser Control PCBs, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517l">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Construction</A>.

<h4><A NAME="hst5517o">Improving the Frequency Stability of HP/Agilent 5517
 Lasers</A></h4>

The following also applies directly to the 5518A and 5519A/B, which are
virtually identical to the 5517s.  It could also be used with the 5501B,
but additional modifications would be needed since these have additional
issues.
<p>
While HP/Agilent lasers are very good for their intended metrology
applications, they can't compare to the best
stabilized HeNe lasers like those from Laboratory For Science,
Spectra-Physics, and others.  There are issues with both short term variation
in optical frequency as well as long term frequency drift.
The 3 most significant are probably:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>HeNe laser power supply ripple:</b> This shows up as a frequency
 modulation of the optical frequency at 30 to 50 kHz (and harmonics) with
 a deviation of up to 1 MHz or more.
<p>
 Replace the HeNe laser power supply with a low noise/low ripple type or
 add an external ripple reducing circuit to its output.  The older VMI 148
 had particularly high ripple, but even the VMI 217 can stand improvement.
 I have not tested the older Laser Drive 111-Adj-1 or the newest VMI 373
 for ripple.  But the VMI-373 already has a ripple reducer built in.
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdrrns">Reducing Ripple
 and Noise in a HeNe Laser Power Supply with a Switchmode Regulator</A>.
<p>
<li><b>LCD beam sampler and sample-and-hold voltage decay:</b> This shows
 up as a sort of "hunting" behavior with a period of around 2.56 seconds,
 resulting in a variation in optical frequency of 50 kHz to 1 MHz or more.
<p>
 (I'm assuming modifications to the common Analog Control PCB.  I do not
 know if it's possible to do this easily to either of the digital control
 PCBs.  At the very least, cuts and jumpers would be much more difficult
 on the dense surface mount PCB.  And, since there are so many of the
 older Analog Control PCBs available, why would you want to!)
<p>
 Remove the LCD panel and its photodiode.  Drill a hole in the beam sampler
 PCB and mount a polarizing beam sampler (e.g., polarizing beam splitter
 cube and a pair of silicon photodiodes) on top of the PCB.  (It might
 even be possible to build this into the plastic housing instead.)
<p>
 The schematic for one possible modification is shown in
 <A HREF="hplm1sch.pdf">Upgraded Electronics for HP-5517 Lasers 1</A>.  This
 references the part numbers found on the 5517A/B/C/D Analog Control PCB,
 and probably the 5518A and 5519A/B as well.
<p>
 The dual trans-impedance preamp for the photodiodes generates separate
 S and P mode signals.  These feed the "Subtracting-Sample-and-Hold" circuit
 modified so that when in "Optical Mode" under feedback control, it passes both
 straight through - no holds allowed!  During "Warmup Mode",
 it must pass the normal heater drive signal.  The added preamp can be
 made from any stable dual op-amp mounted on a little circuit
 board perhaps stuck on top of U12, the LF13331D quad JFET analog switch,
 and attached to the photodiodes via twisted pairs.
 A 1M ohm pot in parallel with a 1 nF capacitor should suffice for the
 op-amp feedback, providing enough gain for all but the weakest laser tubes.
 The op-amp, U101, isn't critical - something like an LT082 would suffice.
 A few cuts and jumpers will be required, but on the wide open through-hole
 layout of the Analog Control PCBs, that shouldn't be too difficult.
 An alternative would be to remove the LF13331D and install an IC
 socket in its place.  Then, build a little PCB that plugs into that
 with the LF13331D and preamp circuitry on it.  Add
 an offset pot and it will then be possible to fine tune the optical
 frequency.  It may not end up pretty, but should work great!  It may
 be easiest to do the modifications in two stages: First replace the
 LCD and its PD with the polarizing beam sampler and preamp, and confirm
 that the correct polarizations are selected - the system should lock
 normally.  Then disable the LCD selection logic so that both signals
 are passed at all times.
<p>
 I later implemented a simpler set of modifications as shown in
 <A HREF="hplm2sch.pdf">Upgraded Electronics for HP-5517 Lasers 2</A>.
 This should produce similar results but with a wee bit less flexibility:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The LCD and the original photodiode PCB were removed and replaced with
  a polarizing beam-splitter cube and a pair of photodiodes.  However, rather
  than adding separate pre-amps for each PD, they were wired in parallel
  with opposite polarity and connected to the same pins as the original PD.
  The resulting signal is then proportional to the difference in photocurrent.
  A two pin connector was installed so that the polarity of the PD signal
  could be determined by experiment rather than trying to figure it out
  based on theory. :)  This would also enable a 5501B tube assembly to be
  easily tested, as it would require opposite polarity due to the
  swap of the F1/F2 axes.
<p>
 <li>Three cuts and jumpers reconfigured the subtracting sample-and-hold.  All
  could be done without removing any ICs:
<p>
  <ol type=i>
  <li>The upper PD input switch (U12D) was disabled (pin 16 tied to ground).
  <li>The upper grounding switch (U12C) was permanently enabled (pin 9
   tied high through a 10K ohm resistor).
  <li>The lower PD input switch (U12A) was enabled by having pin 1
   tied to "-WARM UP" (U3-5).
  </ol>
<p>
  Wiring of the lower "POWER AMP DRIVE" switch (U12B) was unchanged
  (enabled by "DISABLE").
<p>
 <li>A circuit for offset was added so the mode balance could be fine tuned.
  This can vary the net photocurrent by approximately +/-7.5 uA.  If I'm
  ambitious, I'll even drill a hole in the cover so the pot can be twiddled
  without affecting the thermal environment.  As it turned out, the response
  of the two photodiodes was close enough that the laser locked fine and was
  very close to optimal with zero offset.  But the control would enable the
  optical frequency to be moved a few 10s of MHz one way or the other.
<p>
 <li>Pin 4, the RESET input of U10, (LM555, main clock) was isolated from its
  direct connection to +5 VDC and jumpered to "-REF ON" (U1-1).  This turns
  off <i>all</i> the digital circuitry once the laser is locked (READY on
  solid) to eliminate control PCB-originated digital noise.
 </ul>
<p>
 See <A HREF="hplm2p1.jpg">Modified Beam Sampler and Offset Adjust Circuit for
 HP/Agilent 5517 Laser</A> for a photo of these modifications.
<p>
 The first two sets of changes were implemented first.  These worked fine
 with the locking characteristic after warmup, total time-to-lock, uncertainty
 in REF frequency, and slow oscillation in REF frequency appearing
 very similar to the behavior of an unmodified laser.  This is actually a
 rather surprising and unexpected result, so more study will be required. :)
 A discrete time system has been converted into a continuous time system
 without doing anything to the loop parameters and there were no dramatic
 changes the system response.  Interesting....  However, later I did confirm
 that actual locking to the modes occurred almost immediately after the laser
 entered "Optical" mode (about 100 seconds after READY starts flashing).
 I also confirmed that if the photodiode polarity was incorrect, it would
 repetitively pass through the lock point at a rapid rate but never stabilize
 there.  I had expected it to lock to the opposite crossover point of the
 two modes, but apparently the slope there is so much different that it
 never latched on, so to speak.  Or, possibly it would have locked there
 eventually but I did not wait long enough.
<p>
 For the record, the laser first tested with these modifications was
 a somewhat high mileage 5517C with a
 power output of around 240 uW and a REF frequency of around 3.3 MHz, the
 latter being outside the spec'd range for the 5517C (2.4 to 3.0 MHz).
 The uncertainty in REF frequency may be 200 Hz or more.  The variation
 starts out with a period of around 16 seconds and deviation of around
 0.003 MHz.  Over a few hours, it slows down and finally stops (or becomes
 so long as to not be obvious).
<p>
 Some tests:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The "Power Amp" jumper was pulled off which prevents the optical
  signal from affecting the short term stability.  The integrator is good
  enough that the lock-point will remain nearly constant for many seconds.
  Both the randomness and slow frequency variation in REF frequency were
  essentially unchanged.  The heater driver (Power Amp) could still
  be acting in a peculiar way though this doesn't seem all that likely.
<p>
 <li>The main clock was disabled after the laser locked
  by grounding pin 2 of U10, the 555.  This made no detectable
  difference in anything, indicating that these anomalies aren't an issue
  of either some digital signal still affecting the feedback directly or
  digital noise being picked up by the analog electronics.  EVen though
  there was no detectable in behavior, modification (4) was
  installed just for insurance as it was easy enough.
<p>
 <li>A 2M ohm resistor was added in series with the Power Amp input.  (The
  normal input is approximately 2.15M in parallel with 0.22 uF).  This made
  no difference (not surprising given the previous result).
<p>
  Then a 220K ohm resistor placed in parallel with the 2.15M ohm resistor.
  This also had no detectable effect once locked.  But, while the time-to-lock
  didn't change that much, the locking behavior was more rapid after the
  initial warmup.
<p>
 <li>A low ripple low noise linear HeNe laser power supply (modified SP-248)
  was substituted for the original VMI-148.  This also made no significant
  difference.
<p>
 <li>An adjustable HeNe laser power supply was also installed to see if
  running at slightly higher current would have any effect.  There may have
  been a very slight decrease in the randomness but nothing conclusive.
  At the normal current, this tube does have some amplitude ripple that
  disappears at higher current, so that may be related.
<p>
 <li>The PBS cube was mounted at a slight angle to reduce the possibility
  of back-reflections but this also had no obvious effect.  The remaining
  (original) optics of the beam sampler still have perpendicular surfaces
  that could produce back-reflections, but these are still present when
  used in the normal way with the LCD and may be worse, since the LCD
  has several additional perpendicular reflective surfaces.
 </ul>
<p>
 Later, I installed the modified control PCB and beam sampler in a certifiably
 healthy low mileage 5517B (510 uW, 2.32 MHz).  Locking was fine and both the
 randomness and periodic variation in REF were still present, though subtly
 different.  The amplitude of the randomness was slightly lower - perhaps
 averaging 50 Hz compared to 200 Hz.
 The period started at about 10 seconds and the deviation was about 0.0045
 MHz.  However, running this laser with its original Newer Digital Control
 PCB resulted in essentially identical behavior.  However, the deviation as
 well as the amplitude of the randomness also appear to be affected by
 exactly which longitudinal mode pair (i.e., exact temperature) at which
 the laser locks.  A later power-on cycle resulted in a deviation
 of almost 0.01 MHz.  Turning my offset control too far (accidentally!)
 resulted in the laser losing lock and then reaquiring it after the offset
 was turned back toward center.  But the behavior had changed!  The deviation
 in particular had dropped from 0.01 MHz to 0.004 MHz or less.  Nothing else
 was different other than (presumably) where it locked!
<p>
 The detailed character of these artifacts remains a mystery.
 The randomness may in fact be a faster but lower amplitude oscillation
 in REF frequency superimposed on the larger slower one but it's hard to
 tell without actually recording it, which I'm not sure I am eager to do. :)
 Since other evidence suggests that there isn't a corresponding variation
 in optical frequency to go along with the variation in REF frequency, this
 peculiarity may be a fundamental characteristic of the Zeeman laser and
 have nothing to do with the stabilization at all.  Or, they may be the
 result of some sort of etalon effect.  The time constant of the
 slow down in the periodic variation in REF frequency is too long to be
 anything but thermal in origin.  HP/Agilent laser tubes
 have at least 4 planar uncoated glass surfaces outside the laser cavity and
 these are not wedged or set at an obvious angle to minimize back-reflections.
 In addition, the optics of the beam expander telescope and beam sampler have
 several optical surfaces.  Since the structures these are mounted on are all
 mostly temperature independent of the controlled thermal environment of the
 mirror spacing rod, it's possible that one or more are forming some sort
 of external resonator with its longitudinal modes interfering with the
 normal lasing process very slightly.  Maybe.
<p>
 And eventually, I will have to set up the dual laser setup to check the
 optical frequency stability.
<p>
<li><b>Thermal effects due to ambient conditions:</b> While the laser
 cavity itself is well thermally isolated from the environment, the
 outside of the tube and electronics are not.  Variations in the temperature
 of the overall tube assembly can affect gas pressure inside the tube, and
 thus the optical frequency.  Changes in the temperature of the
 electronic components can also affect the location where the optical
 frequency is locked.  One simple way to remedy this might be to add
 a small fan forcing air through the case, with a sensor to control
 its speed based on interior temperature.  Then, put the entire laser
 in a box to minimize air currents.  A more sophisticated scheme
 could use a heater or TEC(s) to actively control the case temperature.
</ol>
<p>
A second order effect is external magnetic fields, but this really
shouldn't be significant unless other Zeeman lasers are living
nearby, or you want to run this inside an MRI machine. :)  And for
the purist, air pressure and seismic activity also affect optical
frequency, but the three modifications described above should reduce
the short and medium term (up to days, probably not years) variation
by more than an order of magnitude.  Long term drift of optical
frequency will be dominated by changes in the laser tube gas pressure
and fill ratio from use, and this can't be easily controlled.  But
periodic diddling with the offset pot can compensate for those. :)

<h4><A NAME="hst5517r">Agilent 5517 Laser RS232 Communications</A></h4>

The following likely only applies to the Newest Digital Control PCB.
I haven't poked around on the Newer Digital Control PCBs yet
but there doesn't seem to be a connector that's obviously
suitable for RS232 on that one.
<p>
And, no, there is nothing labeled "RS232 Port", even on the newest digital
Control PCB.  But, there was a header a with a suspiciously appropriate
number of pins (10) near the SHARC chip, so I started looking at voltages,
and sure enough, pin 3 on the header had -9 VDC on it, and was occasionally
pulsing to 0 V.  So, I made up a cable to my ancient Kiwi laptop, and sure
enough, there was ASCII being spit out at 9600 baud! :)

       9           5      Ground
</PRE>
<p>
The "DB9 Pin" is the result of using an IDC cable wired directly to a
DB9 connector.  These may be salvaged from old PCs as they are
often used to attach the mainboard to the rear panel.  The pin
numbers will be the same on the PC (not swapped).  It's 9600 baud
and full duplex (the laser echos characters typed).  I have no
idea about start and stop bits and parity, but suspect they don't
much matter.
<p>
The few interesting things I've discovered so far are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The 5517D with the bad tube sends out: "Step 0, Step 1, Step 2, Step 0,
 Step 1,,,," repeatedly at somewhat random intervals, with an occasional
 "Step 5" thrown in for good luck.  My guess is that it's never detecting a
 Zeeman beat (REF/split) so cannot proceed.
<p>
<li>The 5517E which locks isn't much more exciting.  Before sending anything
 out the RS232 port, it goes through 25 or 30 repeated fast
 sequences of States taking a couple minutes.  Then it stays in State 0100
 and sends out "Step 0, Step 3, Step 5, Step 0, Step 3,
 Step 5, Step 0, Step 3, Step 5" spaced a couple seconds apart, a short delay
 and then it enters state 0101 and sends out: "LASER", and after several
 minutes: "READY".  The tube heater seems
 to go on coincident with LASER since mode changes speed up dramatically.  This
 is some time after it enters State 0101.  But this digital Control PCB behaves
 slightly differently than the physically identical one in the 5517D with
 respect to the State LEDs: While heating the tube but before the READY LED
 starts flashing, it flashes State 1110 singly 16 times, then doubly 10 or
 11 times, both of these being coincident with the appearance of the Zeeman
 beat suggesting that it may be counting modes
 (but the READY LED does not flash).  Once READY starts flashing continuously,
 this behavior ceases, and the State simply sits at X110 (with the "X"
 tracking the READY LED), then X111, then when "READY" is sent and the
 READY LED is on solid, the State is X000 flashing as with the 5517D.  If
 the path before the beam sampler is momentarily blocked, it sends: "Fop",
 resets to the beginning, and starts over, going through more or less
 the same set of steps, with exactly the same messages as from a cold start.
<p>
 The complete sequence of what's sent from the RS232 port with a working
 tube (for either controller) from start to finish is:

<p>
That's it!  See, I told you it wasn't very exciting. :)
<p>
<li>A ";" returns "FFFFFFFF", but this number can be changed by inputting
 something like "1234:", whereupon, ";" will then return "00001234"
 (only the lower 4 HEX digits can be affected in this manner, the rest will
 be 0s).  So, perhaps the format for loading a register or memory location
 is something like VALUE:ADDRESS;, but without knowing what I'm doing,
 loading random numbers isn't likely to be all that productive!
 It will reset to "FFFFFFFF" on its own at some point if something else
 is loaded.  Other values do pop up as well, but so far they don't seem
 to correlate with much.
</ul>
<p>
Perhaps flipping one of those DIP-switches will put it into Verbose mode,
but picking the wrong one might erase the Universe, so I'm not willing
to risk that - just yet. :)
<p>
At the very least, the runing time is probably maintained in NVRAM and it
would be nice to know how to access that!

The 5517 laser head connector looks like a standard MIL-style bayonet lock
type but apparently is special built for HP by Amphenol.  The part number
may be PT06A-14-18PZ but this has not been confirmed.  It's possible
the mate to these is available direct from Amphenol or a distributor,
but probably not a standard item at an electronics distributor.  It's
actually the same connector as used on the 5500C laser head (PT06A-14-18P),
but the keying is rotated 270 degrees, not that that helps much.  I did
check a Mouser catalog and indeed, the standard connector has the keying
rotated by 270 degrees like the 5500C.  One mating connector from an original
HP cable is labeled: 97 USA/CTI 26SOU 851-06P14-18PX50-44.  Searching for
any of these part numbers only seems to result in non-stock items with no
listed prices - "Ask for Quote".  You know you're in trouble when this is
involved! :)  Used cables for the 5517 are available for around $100 from
various surplus dealers and often on eBay.  But the standard cables may be
10 or 20 feet long and much more than is needed if the other parts of
the interferometry system aren't being used.  For power
and the reference signal, the mating connector and a few wires should
suffice.  It would be a pity to chop up an expensive high quality cable simply
for the connector.  However, it is possible to modify a standard PT06A-14-18P

<h4><A NAME="hst5517p">Common Problems with HP/Agilent 5517 Lasers</A></h4>

Here are some of the faults that typically occur with the 5517A/B/C/D lasers.
Those found in the 5501B, and the 5518A/B and 5519A/B should be
similar since the tube design and electronics are virtually identical.
The comments with respect to tube issues also apply to the
5501A and 5500C lasers, though the details of the remedies will be
slightly different.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>No power:</b> Check the +/-15 VDC outputs of the DC power supplies
 feeding the laser.  Assuming these are present and corrent, there may be
 a blown fuse inside.  If someone applied incorrect power voltage or polarity,
 one or both of the main internal fuses may have blown.  These are 3AG
 types on the 5517s (only one for +15 VDC on the 5517A) and micro (very
 expensive) types on the 5501B.  This would be
 indicated by one or both of the power LEDs being off.  For the 5517, replace
 fuse(s) and test.  For the 5501B, check the capacitors and transistors
 on the Connector PCB before replacing the very expensive fuses.
 Of course, more serious damage may have resulted but fuses
 sometimes do blow for reasons only known to them!  A blown +15 VDC fuse
 (inside the laser) can also mean that the HeNe laser power supply is
 defective, especially for the 5517, where that is the only thing that
 is fed via the internal fuse!  On the 5501B, the HeNe laser power
 supply is fed from the -15 VDC supply (along with other stuff).
 There is also a tiny SMT or picofuse soldered onto most versions
 of the control PCB to protect the logic/analog circuitry.  It's
 very rare for that fuse to blow, mostly due to using incorrect
 power, applying +/-15 VDC before ground, or a power surge.  
<p>
<li><b>No output beam:</b> Check the +15 VDC supply even if its LED on the
 back panel of the laser is on as the voltage could still be low.  This is
 used by the HeNe laser power  supply so if the voltage is low, it will
 produce proportionally lower output voltage and a marginal tube may not
 start.  If the LED is off and the supply is good, check the internal fuse.
 Where the HeNe laser power supply is receiving power but the tube doesn't
 light up, the supply or tube could be bad, or the tube could be very hard
 start.  But if this condition developed suddenly, it's more likely a bad
 supply than a bad tube.  Tubes don't generally just go bad, though if this
 is the first time the system has been power cycled in years, it's possible
 the tube's characteristics have changed.
<p>
 A missing or low -15 VDC supply will not prevent the tube from operating
 but the laser will never lock.
<p>
 The tube and HeNe laser power supply in the 5517, 5518, 5519, (and 5501B)
 can easily be tested using a 15 VDC power supply without powering the rest
 of the laser.  The power supply must be regulated and capable of a current
 of at least 1 amp:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Remove the laser cover.
<p>
 <li>If your power supply is adjustable, set it to 15 VDC +/-0.25 V before
  making connections.  Then turn it off.
<p>
 <li>Unplug the 3-pin power connector for the HeNe laser power supply.
  (The center position will be empty unless the HeNe laser power supply
  has adjustable current as in older 5517As.  The latter is best tested
  tested while connected to the laser.  See the procedure below.)
<p>
 <li>Do NOT unplug the 2-pin tube connector or the ballast and fat
  white anode wire to the tube.
<p>
<li>With power OFF, attach the black wire of the 3-pin power connector
 to the negative output of your DC power supply AND to the bare aluminum
 shroud or chassis of the laser.  If it is desired to check tube current,
 a mA meter may be inserted between the negative of the HeNe laser power
 supply and the laser chassis.
<p>
 <li>Connect the red wire of the 3-pin power connector to the positive output
 of your DC power supply.
<p>
 <li>Apply power.  The tube should light up immediately if it is very healthy,
  but some may take a few seconds or longer.  There should also be an expanded
  laser beam out the front that is continuously on - not flickering or
  sputtering.  Alow it to run for 1/2 hour or longer and make sure it
  continues to remain on continuously.
</ol>
<p>
There still can be problems once power is applied to the heater inside the
tube but at least this test proves that the tube isn't dead.  Also note that
if output power is measured in this unlocked state, it may be 50 percent
or more greater than once locked.
<p>
<li><b>Low power but locks:</b> This is likely the most common ailment.
 Metrology lasers are often run 24/7 from when they are put into service
 until the fab or whatever is decommissioned or the laser fails to meet
 minimum specifications during preventive maintenance.  The rated life
 of the laser tubes is typically 50,000 hours, but the power does decline
 over this time.  This is often *why* they become available on the surplus
 market!
<p>
 There is no practical way to boost output power from a weak tube.  But note
 that the power may increase 10 percent or so with an hour warmup compared to
 what it is just after locking.  So, the situation may not be quite as bad
 as it appears initially.
<p>
 However, a laser with power below the 180 &micro;W HP/Agilent specifications
 may still be very usable, especially with simpler interferometer setups or
 fewer interferometer axes.  The optical receivers are quite sensitive and only
 a few &micro;W is sufficient for a stable beat frequency signal.  With my
 crude setup using a 10780A optical receiver at its default threshold setting,
 12 &micro;W from the laser resulting in 8 &micro;W at the receiver is
 sufficient power.  Adjusting the 10780A's threshold setting or using a
 10780C optical receiver which is more sensitive would require even less
 power.
<p>
 But a low power laser may have other problems.  See below.
<p>
<li><b>Low power and does not lock:</b> The symptoms are that the laser goes
 through its normal warmup routine but just when you expect the READY LED to
 come on steady, it goes out for about 1 second and then starts flashing
 again.  Somewhere below about 120 &micro;W of beam power, there is
 insufficient power available to the internal optical reference receiver for
 it to generate the logic signal that tells the state machine there is
 a valid reference signal.  So, even though there is plenty of power
 to be useful, the state machine that controls locking thinks that there is no
 reference signal and the laser fails to stabilize.  On a laser with marginal
 power (around 100 to 120 &micro;W), it may abort once or twice or a few times
 until the output power creeps up above the detection threshold, and then
 lock as though there is no problem.  Some 5517s (possibly 5517Bs which
 seem to have a lower minimum power rating for some reason) will lock
 down to 80 &micro;W or less.  Installing the Control PCB from one of those
 lasers should then allow another type 5517 laser to lock at a lower power
 as the Control PCBs are otherwise interchangeable.  The difference seems
 to be in the values of two parts near pin 1 of U17 (the reference receiver
 IC):
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Low threshold Analog Control PCBs have only a 0.1 uF capacitor below pin 1
  and a 61.9 ohm resistor next to it.
<p>
 <li>High threshold Analog Control PCBs have a series combination of a 0.1 uF
  capacitor (labeled 104) and 4.7 uH inductor (silver, yellow, gold,
  violet, silver) installed in place of the 0.1 uF capacitor approximately
  below pin 1 of U17 and a 195 ohm resistor (brown, white, blue, black)
  next to it.
<p>
  All Analog Control PCBs made after somewhere around 1990 are wired this
  way yet the PCB artwork was never updated.  I don't know whether
  this modification was done to prevent locking where the REF signal is
  so low that it might be corrupted by amplitude ripple resulting from HeNe
  laser power supply current ripple, or simply to sell more lasers since they
  will fail to lock sooner. :)
<p>
 <li>Moving the "REF" jumper to the "LO" position will enable the laser to lock
  but there may not be a REF signal out of the laser.
<p>
 <li>To modify an Analog Control PCB to be low threshold,
  simply install a 62 ohm resistor (none of this has to be precise!)
  in place of the 195 ohm resistor, and if this alone isn't sufficient,
  remove the 4.7 uH inductor.  Or, even easier: Solder a 100 ohm resistor
  between the junction of the capacitor and inductor and the top of the
  195 ohm resistor, which seems to work just as well.
 </ul>
<p>
 For late model 5517s, the Newer Digital Control PCBs will lock below
 25 &micro;W if the "REF" jumper is set to "LO" and they will generate
 a REF signal, though it's not known what threshold is needed to operate
 normally.  The corresponding parameters for the Newest Digital Control
 PCBs are not known at all.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hst5517l">HP/Agilent 5517 Laser Construction</A>.
<p>
 There are two other work-arounds for an inability to lock due to low power
 where you don't want to modify the Control PCB:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>If the electrical reference signal from the laser is not needed, then
  moving the "REF ON" jumper (JMP2) inside the laser from the "NORM" to the
  "LO" position (second from the right, low is the asserted condition,
  contrary to what's in the manual) will force the state machine to think
  there is an acceptable reference and locking will occur normally.  Of course,
  there will likely be no reference signal from the laser (though it might
  appear awhile later when the output power has increased slightly).  So, the
  reference will have to be generated externally by an additional beamsplitter
  and optical receiver, if none was present originally.
<p>
 <li>If the electrical reference signal from the laser is needed, it would be
  possible to replace the main beamsplitter at the output of the laser with
  one that has a higher reflectivity.  It's a 45 degree plate that can be
  removed and replaced with something from Melles Griot or other optics
  supplier.  Of course, this will further reduce the available beam power,
  but so would the external beamsplitter required in (1) above.
 </ol>
<p>
 The first of these is probably preferred as it doesn't require permanent
 modifications to the laser.  An external 5 or 10 percent beamsplitter and
 optical receiver are required but the beamsplitter can probably just be
 a microscope slide at 45 degrees and any of the optical receivers would be
 suitable for generating the reference since it operates at a fixed
 frequency not greater than 4 MHz regardless of the laser model.  The
 obsolete 10780A or 10780B can be obtained very inexpensively.
<p>
 It may also be possible to change a component in the reference detection
 circuit but I have so far been unable to obtain a datasheet for the actual
 IC that is used there - HP part number 1826-0775 or the manufacturer's
 part number 1DA7Q (assuming this isn't simply some random collection of
 characters that was never updated since Google has no clue about it!).
<p>
<li><b>Hard start but runs fine:</b> This means it takes a long time for a
 beam to appear, but the laser operates correctly and reliably once it does
 start.  There is no built-in delay so the tube should start nearly instantly,
 but some may take many seconds or minutes to light up.  (Do not confuse this
 situation with a laser where the beam appears quickly but it takes a long
 time for READY to come on solid.  The latter could be due to low power or an
 electronic problem.  Gain access to the beam path and check for red light!)
<p>
 There is most likely nothing really wrong with the laser but the tube is
 simply high mileage or one that has difficulty starting.  Some tubes
 become like this.  Even the Ph.D. types at a major laser company really don't
 know why.  Aside from time wasted twiddling one's thumbs, a tube that takes
 a long time to start is hard on the HeNe laser power supply, but the ones in
 these lasers seem tough.  Do check the DC voltages, particularly for the
 +15 VDC supply, which is what powers the HeNe laser power supply.  While
 the rest of the laser may run on 12 VDC or below, lower DC voltage means
 proportionally lower starting voltage for the tube.  And lower voltages
 may be more stressful both on the HeNe laser power supply and other parts
 of the laser, as well as being more likely to take a long time to start
 with an uncooperative tube.
<p>
 In several instances, I found that shining a light on the *back-end* of the
 tube would promote starting in an otherwise uncooperative laser.  Electrical
 discharge initiation is known to be sensitive to light and radioactivity,
 so this effect isn't entirely surprising.  A radioactive source would work
 but putting a radiation warning sticker on the laser might invite a visit
 from Homeland Security.  So, I opted for LEDs instead. :)  For some
 tubes, a high brightness red LED shining on the glass extension at
 the back of the tube is sufficient to reduce the starting time from
 a minute or more to a couple of seconds.  A blue LED seems to be even
 more effective especially for particularly uncooperative tubes.  The
 LED can be conveniently wired to the HeNe laser power supply on the back of
 the connector PCB.  I now routinely install an LED if there is any hint
 of slow start.  It can't hurt and so far, has seemed to help significantly.
 For a higher level of sophistication, add a circuit to turn off the LED
 once the tube starts!
<p>
 It's also possible that electrical leakage is reducing the effective starting
 voltage.  If there is a smell of ozone while the tube is trying to start,
 then corona is present from the anode terminal.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The back of the tube assemblies used in the 5517A, 5518A, and 5519A/B
  lasers, is filled with a block of soft foam rubber to protect the glass
  structure and electrical terminals.  As we know, old foam can
  deteriorate.  And the ozone produced by high voltage corona from a
  hard-to-start tube will accelerate such deterioration.  And rotted foam
  may attract moisture and thus not be such a good insulator.  Starting on
  humid days may be even more problematic.  So, for these
  lasers, check the condition of the foam.  If it's gooey and sticky and
  falls apart, remove the dead foam and clean out the area with cotton
  swabs and alcohol.  Then add some insulation like several coats of Epoxy
  or high voltage sealer to the area of the anode terminal and/or a sleeve
  of plastic surrounding it.  This may greatly reduce starting
  time.  On one laser, it went from many minutes or never to instant or
  a few seconds.  The dead foam probably wouldn't cause a problem on a
  tube that starts normally, but with a hard-start tube, every extra
  bit of voltage counts!  If you sent a laser with a starting problem
  like this to Agilent for evaluation, they would probably say: "Tube
  is bad.  Buy new laser.". :)
<p>
  CAUTION: Take care to avoid stressing or bending the wire connections
  to the tube terminals when removing the old foam and cleaning and
  insulating the anode, as well as reinstalling the tube assembly in
  the laser.  Avoid applying force (especially side-ways) to the cathode/heater
  terminals and their glass-to-metal seals, and avoid repeated bending
  of the anode wire since re-attaching that should it break off could be
  challenging.
<p>
 <li>It's possible that the rubbery potting compound that fills the back area
  of the tube assemblies used in most of the other 5517 lasers as well as
  the 5501B can deteriorate in a similar manner with similar consequences,
  but I have not had a chance to confirm this.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Flickering, sputtering, or inability to stay lit:</b>  This may happen
 immediately, or at some time during warmup or even after the READY LED
 comes on (and it will then start flashing).  It may take a long time for
 the initial start as well.  The most likely cause is that the tube is
 high mileage and its dropout current has increased to the point where
 it is equal or greater than the operating current.  However,
 low DC power or a bad HeNe laser power supply is also possible.
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Check and adjust the +15 VDC power supply if needed.  Also, make sure
  it doesn't drop significantly when the laser is first powered up.  If it
  does, the power supply regulation or cabling could have problems, or the
  laser may be drawing excessive current.  (Do the same tests for the -15 VDC
  supply as well but it doesn't power the laser tube and the current is
  very low.)
<p>
 <li>If the installed HeNe laser power supply is adjustable, it will have
  a power connector with three wires in the cable and is typically a Laser
  Drive brick labeled something like 111-Adj-1, but the adjustment in via a
  trimpot next to the power connector, NOT on the power supply itself.
  (Most of these lasers do NOT have an adjustable power supply.  I've only
  seen it on older 5517As, though the pot is present on all 5517s.)
  If the power supply has only two power wires and is thus not adjustable,
  an external adjustable HeNe laser power supply will have to be used.  In
  either case, it is desirable to monitor the tube current during the
  procedure.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>For the internal adjustable HeNe laser power supply, 
   remove the 2 pin laser tube connector (red and purple wires) and install
   a 1K ohm resistor between the purple wire and the pin which plugged into
   it or the bare aluminum shroud.
<p>
  <li>An external HeNe laser power supply will need to have a current range
   that includes 3.5 to 4 mA, and a voltage compliance of 1,000 to 1.500 V.
   It can be either AC or DC input since it will be powered separate from the
   laser.  Unplug the laser from its power supply.  Unplug the
   DC power connector of the internal HeNe laser power supply.  Remove the
   2 pin laser tube connector (red and purple wires) and install
   a 1K ohm resistor between the purple wire and the negative of
   the external supply.  Unscrew the black retaining ring of the
   anode connector under the laser tube and separate the power supply
   and laser tube parts of the connector.  This can probably be done
   without removing the tube assembly if you have small fingers.
   Attach the positive output of the external HeNe laser power supply
   (no additional ballast resistors needed) to the female socket with
   a suitable piece of wire.  Make sure it is well insulated
   with a generous number of layers of electrical tape, a plastic
   tube, or something similar!!!!!  WARNING: Wait at least 5
   minutes before doing this after removing power to allow internal
   capacitors to discharge!!!  To be sure, use a 100K to 1M ohm resistor
   to short the power supply anode connector to the negative of the power
   supply, and the tube anode connector to the purple wire of the tube
   connector.
  </ul>
<p>
  Attach a multimeter on DC Volts across the 1K ohm resistor.  The reading
  will be 1 V/mA.  Power up and start at the default current setting
  for the internal HeNe laser power supply of 3.5 mA.  If increasing
  the current results in a stable output, then the problem is almost
  certainly the dropout current as noted above.  The current will need
  to be slightly beyond where the laser is stable.  3.75 or 4 mA shouldn't
  hurt it or significantly reduce life expectancy.  There's no choice
  anyhow as this may be the only practical way to get these tubes to stay lit!
  If the tube is unstable even at 4 or 4.5 mA, then the problem may be the
  power supply, or the ballast resistor attached to the tube (quite unusual).
<p>
  Limited anecdotal evidence suggests that a laser repaired in this manner
  will run continuously with useful power for several months.  And, of course,
  if only turned on when needed, for much longer.
<p>
  Adding an anode ballast resistance without increasing the laser tube
  current may work in marginal cases.  But in my tests, even as much as
  35K ohms only reduced the dropout current by 0.1 or 0.2 mA.  So, it
  alone is probably not a reliable solution for a tube that doesn't stay
  lit.  But adding some modest anode ballast resistnace (10K to 20K) is
  worth doing to reduce the chance of amplitude ripple as discussed below.
 </ol>
<p>
 CAUTION: DO NOT allow a laser to continue sputtering for a long time.
 This may damage the laser tube and destroy the power supply.  I've had
 5517 lasers where the HeNe laser power supply had been blown due to unattended
 sputtering, though it's not clear if there was any damage to the tube.  But,
 on two 5501A tubes I tested, rapid sputtering as a result of a defective
 HeNe laser power supply caused the output mirror inside the tube to literally
 have a hole blown in the exact center of its coating, rendering the tube
 useful only as a magnetic paper clip holder/desk ornament or paperweight!
 One tube had a hole just about the size of where the beam would have been
 as can be seen in <A HREF="5501ax1.jpg">Hewlett Packard 5501A HeNe Laser
 Tube with Missing Coating in Center of Output Mirror</A>.  But
 the other had a clear hole in the coating over 2 mm in diameter!
<p>
 Note that in a 5501A or 5500C, sputtering may either be due to a
 defective HeNe laser power supply (probably the potted module), the
 laser current being set too low, or the tube itself being unable to
 stay lit at any current setting.  With the current setting being
 under user control, it's critical to set
 it so that the tube will stay lit.  The current should be set according
 to the recommended value on the label (if any), but subject to the constraint
 that it be at least 0.2 to 0.3 mA higher than the dropout current after
 a 1 hour warmup to assure reliable operation in the long term.
 If there is no value listed, then assume 3.0 mA or adjust for maximum
 output power when locked between 3.0 to 3.3 mA, but subject
 to the same constraint.  (The nominal operating current may range from
 2.6 to 5.1 mA, according to the 5501A manual.  But most are between
 3.0 and 3.3 mA, so if there is no value listed, it's safer to keep it
 within this range if possible.)  The current may either be measured
 by installing a mA meter between the tube cathode post (on the side
 of the large glass bulb of the tube) and its connecting wire, or by
 measuring the voltage on the laser current testpoint, which is series
 with a 390 ohm resistor to ground.  So, the current will be V/390.
 The testpoint is accessible on the left side of the rear connector PCB,
 just above the laser current adjust pot, R11.  Leave the right side
 cover in place to activate the interlock switch that enables the laser
 to turn on.
<p>
<li><b>Random dropouts:</b> This is essentially the extremely rare case of
 the flickering, etc., tube, above.  These may not even be noticeable by
 eye but only when the laser is installed in a system that actually monitors
 the REF and MEAS outputs, such as a 5508A Measurement Display.  The
 indications that such an event took place may be "Hd Error" or "SL Error".
<p>
 Aside from problems in the electronics, a very unusual cause might be an
 intermittent connection *inside* the HeNe laser tube.  Broken welds are
 possible, but what's more likely is just bad contact with respect to the
 cathode terminal, a pressed-on slide fit in the 5501B and later lasers, and
 simply a tab pressing on the through-glass terminal on the 5501A.  As the
 parts expand, the result is momentary loss of contact.  I've never actually
 confirmed this in an HP/Agilent tube though I do have a 5501B that is
 suspect.  While not that common, it does happen with conventional tubes.
 Needless to say, there is no truly guaranteed practical
 fix other than installing a replacement tube.  However, such events
 are much more likely before the system reaches thermal equilibrium.
 So, simply running the laser for awhile before use may be sufficient
 to reduce the frequency of occurrence of these glitches to zero.  And thus
 lasers run 24/7 may never experience them after the first few hours.
<p>
 One time, I was 100 percent sure that a bad internal connection was
 the problem with a 5501A.  But it turned out to be much simpler.
 The tube would drop out at random times anywhere from a few seconds to
 hours apart (generally less frequent after warming up).  The
 tube was absolutely healthy in all other respects - great power, instant
 start, and stable over the full range of laser current adjustment.  But
 the symptoms always remained with the tube when it was installed in two
 known good laser chassis.  The tube was even connected to a stand-alone
 HeNe laser power supply and then, tapping on the tube would sometimes
 induce a dropout.  However, I was suspicious of the anode contact as
 jiggling the HV wire would also tend to cause dropouts.  And, indeed, with
 the front optics assembly removed, the anode terminal was found to be only
 a short stump (probably original) flush with the glass.  And
 there were also bits of RTV Silicone stuck to it (origin unknown).
 I had tried to clean that terminal early on in this saga with no change
 in behavior, but RTV Silicone bits don't come off easily, especially if
 they were visible!  So, they were preventing the spring contact from
 seating firmly against the terminal.  Or something. :)
<p>
<li><b>Amplitude ripple:</b> As some tubes get up in use, they develop an
 instability in the discharge current resulting in plasma oscillation.  This
 produces a corresponding amplitude ripple of the laser beam, typically around
 700 kHz for the 5517 lasers.  (This also applies to the 5501B, as well as
 the 5501A, but probably at a different frequency.)  The effect of the
 ripple is to interfere with the normal beat frequency signal returned from an
 interferometer, especially if the tube is relatively weak.  As long as
 the output power of the laser is high enough such that the amplitude of
 the beat frequency signal is greater than the amplitude of the ripple, there
 should be no gross effects on measurement accuracy or repeatability
 at resolutions larger than a wavelength.  But it is possible that
 for sub-wavelength measurements, especially with a resolution extender,
 accuracy may be affected.  However, having seen this issue on many
 lasers, I really don't even know for sure if it is something that
 really matters where the output power is above HP/Agilent specs.
 But in extreme cases with a very low power laser, the amplitude of
 the ripple may exceed that of the beat frequency signal resulting
 in it being totally incorrect and fluctuating from 700 kHz to
 possibly beyond the proper value at random.  Under these conditions,
 reliable measurements are not possible at all even though the laser
 may still lock normally.
<p>
 Viewing the beat frequency from an optical receiver on an oscilloscope will
 show all edges except the one used for triggering the scope to be
 fuzzy as the bogus signal modulates the position of the zero
 crossings, rather than the clean waveform that is expected.
 (But check and touch optical alignment as poor alignment can also
 result in a fuzzy signal.)
 The oscillation itself will show up when only one polarized Zeeman mode is
 presented to an optical receiver (e.g., by blocking the return beam from the
 interferometer) or by using a photodetector and oscilloscope.  In the
 latter case, it will be seen as a sinusoidal waveform that is present
 *without* a polarizer.  With a polarizer, the beat frequency signal will
 be riding on top of the ripple.  A typical ripple amplitude is 10 &micro;W but
 this can vary greatly.  It will also appear by itself at the output of an
 optical receiver while the laser is warming up between those times when
 the normal beat frequency signal is present.
<p>
 The exact cause of the bogus signal is not known but it probably has to do
 with the tube's negative resistance.  The ballast resistor for these
 tubes is located 5 to 6 inches from the anode (which is much longer than
 the 2 to 3 inches usually recommended for HeNe lasers) and the wire between
 the resistor and tube may run close to the grounded chassis, adding
 capacitance.  So this certainly makes such problems more likely.
<p>
 For tubes that meet HP specifications for output
 power (180 &micro;W for most models), it is probably not necessary to do
 anything about this oscillation unless specific measurement issues
 can be directly tied to it.  In fact, I've seen it in lasers that
 appeared to be virtually new in all other respects, so it may
 simply be considered normal!
<p>
 There are two ways of eliminating the amplitude ripple:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The best solution is to add some additional ballast resistance as close
  to the tube as possible, but this does require splicing into tube anode wire
  and thus voiding the tube warranty. :)  A resistance of 10K ohms seems to be
  enough.  I used 20K ohms to be conservative on the first unit I repaired in
  this manner.  The added voltage seen by the power supply (35 V per 10K ohms
  at the normal 3.5 mA tube current) should not annoy it very much.  Make sure
  the resistors are very well insulated.  There can be over 10,000 V present
  during starting!
<p>
  Adding a cathode ballast resistor would probably eliminate the oscillation
  as well but this is not an option with 5517/18/19 or 5501B lasers since the
  cathode is attached to the heater used for thermal tuning inside the tube
  and it must be near ground potential.  A cathode ballast resistor should be
  acceptable on the 5501A.
<p>
 <li>The other solution, as with the case of a tube that doesn't remain lit,
  is to slightly increase the tube operating current.  But this will probably
  require replacing the HeNe laser power supply on all lasers except
  the 5501A since they usually don't have HeNe laser power supplies with
  adjustable current.  See the procedure above, for details.  But where
  the current has to be increased anyhow, the amplitude ripple problem
  may be solved as well, though I'd still recommend also adding the
  extra ballast resistance.
 </ul>
<p>
 I don't know for how long these cures will be effective or whether they
 work in all cases.  And sometimes, both will be required.  If the
 increased current is needed to fix a tube that won't stay lit, try that
 method first.
<p>
 I have found another oscillation at around 100 kHz
 with some lasers that's probably even lower level.  Adding ballast has little
 or no effect on this so it may be from some other cause like the switching
 frequency of the HeNe laser power supply.  I haven't seen a laser where
 this was of any consequence once locked though - the beat waveform is clean,
 especially with respect to the full cycle.  If the scope is triggered on the
 rising edge, then there may be some fuzz on the falling edge, but not
 subsequent rising edges.  And, it's generally very small.
<p>
<li><b>Excessive mode imbalance:</b> In principle, the H and V modes should
 be maintained exactly equal inside the laser since the LCD panel alternately
 selects them and the feedback loop attempts to make the difference 0.
 However, the beam exiting the laser goes through a 45 degree beam sampler
 and this has a polarization preference of a few percent with the H mode
 output power being slightly higher than V.
 So, even a properly functioning laser will have a mode ratio that differs
 slightly from 1:1 and I've measured up to 1.1:1 with about 1.04:1
 seeming to be typical.  The result of an internal mode imbalance will be a
 shift in the optical frequency of the lock point away from the optimal
 value.  While I don't know of any actual specifications for the mode
 ratio, The range 1 to 1.1:1 should still result in the optical frequency
 being well within the HP/Agilent specifications of +/-0.1 ppm
 (roughly +/-47.4 MHz) compared to 633 nm (about 474 THz).
 However, if you were to measure a much higher ratio - say 1.25:1 - then
 it would be worth trying to identify the cause since a total failure
 to lock might be in the laser's future.  Many factors go into the
 lock point including the response of the LCD panel and its
 drive signal, the polarization selectivity of the two 45 degree beam
 samplers (they are at 90 degrees to each-other so this should cancel
 but it might not if there was contaminatino or damage), and offset
 in the error amplifier.  See the paragraph below on the LCD panel.
<p>
<li><b>Corrupted or missing MEAS signal:</b> Where there is ample power,
 the laser locks reliably, and the interferometer optics are aligned such
 the thing should be working, one non-electronic cause of signal problems
 may be a beam expander that is way out of adjustment.  If the wavefront
 curvature of the reference and measurement beams is not close to being the
 same, the resulting MEAS signal may be degraded, possibly to the point
 where it will no longer be a function of position/velocity but rather
 just a constant frequency.  Accidental misadjustment of the beam expander
 is impossible on most of these lasers, but older ones like the 5500A/C
 and 5501A adjustable beam expanders that might have been twiddled.
</ul>
<p>
The following are causes that may produce a variety of symptoms:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bad LCD panel resulting in no lock:</b> While electronic problems are
 relatively uncommon, one that sometimes occurs and is easy to check is
 a failure of the LCD-based optical switch at the output of the laser.
 This is used to select between the horizontal and vertical polarized
 Zeeman modes applied to a subtracting sample-and-hold in the stabilization
 feedback loop.  If the LCD panel deteriorates or is damaged, everything
 will seem to work but the laser will never lock and READY will keep flashing.
 Of course, many other electronic faults can result in the same behavior, but
 LCD failure is probably the most likely.
<p>
 Variations in the beam sampler behavior even among units considered to
 be good can result in a shift in the optical frequency of 5 MHz or
 more.  In fact, from my admittedly limited tests of 3 supposedly
 good beam sampler assemblies, this may be the dominant factor
 affecting optical frequency in lasers with a similar number of
 hours on the tube.  However, I do not know if it is due
 to variations in the LCD panels, or the other optics of the beam sampler.
 While the laser will still easily meet specifications (5 MHz is
 only about 0.01 ppm), this is an annoyance in the elegance of these
 systems department. :)  But, without comparing the laser's output
 to a reference, the only symptom may be a larger than expected mode
 imbalance, though a visual inspection and electrical testing of the
 LCD panel as described below may identify marginal units.
<p>
 Some LCDs also seem to cause a continuous or intermittent hunting behavior
 of the optical frequency with a larger deviation than is normal.  All
 HP/Agilent lasers exhibit a slow variation in optical frequency with a
 period of around 2.56 seconds and a deviation of 100 kHz or so.
 The frequency deviation in some lasers may be up to +/-0.5 MHz
 or even more.  Since this amount of wobble in the optical frequency is well
 below HP/Agilent specifications, this should probably be filed under
 the "well that's interesting department" rather than considered a serious
 issue.  The only way to detect it would be to beat (heterodyne) two lasers
 together and look at the difference frequency.  The cause is a direct
 result of the stabilization loop implementation using an LCD to alternately
 select each of the two polarized modes, rather than using the more
 conventional polarization beam sampler and a pair of photodiodes.
<p>
 The LCD panel is inside the beam sampler assembly following the output end of
 the laser tube.  Remove the two screws on top holding the beam sampler in
 place and at least the two mounting screws for that end of the main PCB to
 allow it to be pushed away from the laser body slightly.  Then, it should
 be possible to pop the beam sampler off of the laser.  Working over a soft
 pad should the LCD panel fall out, remove the small PCB with the photodiode,
 and use fine tweezers to pull out the elastomer ("Zebra Stripe") connector
 padss.  Then, the LCD panel should slide out of the plastic housing.  Simply
 rotating a polarizer behind it while looking through from the front may
 reveal an obvious problem like two or more sections that have different
 polarization orientations.  The entire panel should be the same polarization.
 If this simple test doesn't turn up anything, then apply a 50 Hz AC
 (balanced) 5 p-p V squarewave across the electrodes on either side
 of the LCD panel (where the elastomer pads were pressing) while
 looking through it and the polarizer.  (It can be placed
 on top of a polarizing filter on a white piece of paper.)  When applying
 the 50 Hz signal, the density should change dramatically and uniformally.
 CAUTION: Make sure the signal is AC with no DC component of applied for
 more than a few seconds as prolonged DC current through the LCD can
 damage it.  However, momentary DC won't hurt.
<p>
 Since the elastomer may tend to stick to the LCD, even easier is to
 test the LCD in place by removing the sampler PCB and covering the
 reference PD port (side) and output window (front) with pieces of
 black tape.  Put a polarizer over the input port (back) and look
 through the sampler port (top) with the input port facing a brightly
 illuminated white surface.  Then, one orientation of the polarizer
 should show a uniform bright field while the orthogonal orientation
 should show a uniform dark field.  Apply the voltage and these
 should flip states.
<p>
 Or, just swap in an LCD panel from another laser and see if it now locks! :)
 The 5501B and all 551X lasers appear to use the same LCD panel and probably
 the same beam sampler optics assembly (the black plastic housing and the
 optics inside it), the top PCB with the photodiode monitoring the LCD
 output is larger for the lasers in the large cases (5517A, 5518A/B,
 and 5519A).
<p>
<li><b>Improper orientation of tube output waveplates causing inability to
 to lock and/or misalignment or impure F1/F2:</b> If the blue sealing paint
 on the waveplates is intact, this should be a non-issue as waveplate
 orientation won't change on its own and the tube's polarization axes
 should not change over the life of the tube.  However, if someone messed
 with the waveplates for some reason, like out of curiosity, without marking
 their original orientations, this could result in the laser never
 coming READY, and even if it does, in the polarization axes of F1 and F2
 not being properly aligned with X and Y, as well as there not being pure
 F1 and F2 signals at any orientation.  There's also a very slight chance
 that the one of the waveplate disks has popped off from its glue and is
 no longer oriented correctly.  Readjustment or repair of the waveplates is
 beyond the scope of this summary.  Email for more information.
<p> 
<li><b>Bad HeNe laser power supply:</b> A failure of the HeNe laser power
 supply brick may result in no beam, sputtering or flickering, or
 excessive ripple in the amplitude of the output.  This may be present
 immediately at power-on, or happen after components warm up.  The simplest
 way to confirm is to substitute a known working HeNe laser power supply,
 either an identical unit from another HP laser, or something that will
 provide 3.5 mA at 1,500 to 1,800 V (typical of a 1 to 2 mW laser).  See the
 information above on measuring current for hookup details.
<p>
 Where an adjustable power supply brick is found to be bad, it can be replaced
 with a fixed current supply as long as the tube was being run at the default
 current of 3.5 mA - which would be in the vast majority of cases unless
 the tube was high mileage and would only stay lit on higher current.
 I had to do this for a 5517A.  The original supply would start and run long
 enough for the laser to lock, but would then sputter a few tims and blow
 the internal fuse.  Swapping in a supply from a 5517C repaired that.
<p>
<li><b>Dried up electrolytic capacitors:</b> There may be present both on
 the Connector PCB and the Control PCB.  These lasers are often run 24/7 and
 can become rather warm inside.  So, on very old lasers (i.e., more than
 15 or 20 years), it's probably worth testing them with an ESR meter, or
 simply installing new ones (there are under 10 total and they can be
 replaced with common types).  Bad caps on the Connector PCB may not result
 in obvious symptoms except on 5501Bs (see below), but there are a pair on
 the Control PCB that may result in oscillation of the power amp driving
 the heater, with eventual loss of lock and/or mode imbalance and/or
 significant offset from the nominal optical frequency.  For 5501Bs,
 two of the electrolytic capacitors on the Connector PCB (the blue ones
 standing up if they are original) are snubber caps for the Pulse Width
 Modulation (PWM) heater
 driver transistors.  (The 5501B is the only HP/Agilent laser to use PWM
 rather than linear control for the heater.)  If these capacitors go bad,
 the driver transistors fail shorted, taking out the main fuses (if you're
 lucky) or the DC power supply (if you're not).  I blew out 4 driver
 transistors before checking the obvious. :( :)  So, simply replacing all
 electrolytic capacitors on the Connector PCB of older 5501Bs
 is a good idea.  You might as well do that on the Control PCB as well
 while you're at it.  The total cost will be under $5.
<p>
<li><b>Other electronic problems:</b> The good news is that faults in the
 logic or analog circuitry are not very common with any of these lasers.
 I've only seen a three 5517 lasers that were malfunctioning due to non-tube
 or LCD related faults.  One was a late model 5517C with a blown fuse on
 the Control PCB, cause unknown.  The laser seems to work reliably with a
 new fuse (fingers crossed).  And because it was taken out of service due
 to the blown fuse, the tube was quite healthy - quick start and near new
 power.  Another had dried up electrolytic capacitors on the Control PCB
 resulting in oscillation of the heater driver circuitry, and drift of the
 lock point.  The third had a bad REF driver IC.  All of these were trivial
 repairs.
</ul>
<p>
For detailed service information, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsthpref">Additional HP/Agilent Resources</A>.
While there is nothing on the 5517 laser specifically, the electronics
of the 5518A (part of the 5528A Measurement System) and 5517A is
identical except that the 5518A has an
additional PCB (the internal optical receiver).  And the electronics
of 5517B/C/D lasers using the Analog Control PCB is close enough
to that of the 5518A to be useful for troubleshooting and repair.

<h3><A NAME="hst5518">Notes on the HP-5518A Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 5518A is basically a 5517A with an optical receiver added for the
return beam.  It was the successor to the 5500C
intended for use in the 5528A Laser Measurement System
along with the 5508A Measurement Display.  (The 5518A has the same
REF frequency specifications as the 5517A and can be used exactly
like a 5517A laser by ignoring the optical receiver.)
The chassis, laser tube, and Connector and Control PCBs
are identical to those of the 5517A.  An additional optical receiver
PCB which plugs into the control PCB is added inside the front of the
laser, and the front bezel and shutter assembly differ for the 5518A.
<p>
There are two apertures at the output-end of the laser.  The top one is
the normal laser output, with the usual control wheel for a large opening
(normal), small opening (alignment), and closed.  It is also the return
port for straightness measurements <i>only</i>.  A second aperture below it
is for the optical receiver.  This aperture is used for all measurements
<i>except</i> straightness.  It has a control wheel for large (normal) and
closed (which then has an alignment target printed on the exposed surface).
A large Turret Ring behind the apertures has two positions: Straight
and Other.  For straightness measurements, it inserts optics in the
normal laser output aperture to direct a return beam there to the
optical receiver, and a microswitch is activated to change the
gain of the optical receiver.  (The laser output power is
also reduced somewhat in this position, so the optical
receiver needs to be more sensitive.)  There are also "Laser ON"
and "Signal" LEDs on the front bezel.  Laser On is the same as the
LED on the back panel.  Signal is lit when there is enough of a
return beam to the optical receiver to be useful.
<p>
Several photos of a 5518A laser head can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
(Version 2.42 or higher) under "Hewlett Packard HeNe Lasers".
<p>
The 5518A I have includes one additional component, not present in any
other HP/Agilent laser I've seen, and that is a shield or cover surrounding
the area of the beam expander, purpose unknown.
<p>
I have reverse engineered the schematic for the Optical Receiver PCB
shown in <A HREF="hp18orp1.jpg">Photos of HP-5518A Optical Receiver PCB</A>.  
See <A HREF="hp18rsch.pdf">HP-5518A Optical Receiver Schematic</A>.
Most of the component designations are arbitrary since very few had anything
on the artwork.  Although it performs a function similar to that of
external optical receivers like the 10780C, the circuit is considerably
simpler and nearly identical to that of the reference receiver on the
Control PCB.  The built-in photodiode can be seen below the hole through
which the output beam passes.  The two pin header attaches to the microswitch
in the current assembly that selects gain based on whether it is set
for "Straight(ness)" or "Other".  The gain is increased in Straightness
mode since the outgoing beam passes through a non-polarizing
beam-splitter and the return beam reflects off of it
<p>
I would also like to find the non-HP equivalent of the receiver IC U1,
HP part number 1826-0775, listed as 1DA7Q on the HP schematic of the 5517B
laser, which (among others) uses the same IC.  If anyone has a standard
part number and/or datasheet, please contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ Email Links Page</A>.
Of course, maybe 1DA7Q was just a random text string intended to be
replaced by the actual part number and that never happened! :)  A different
revision of the schematic shows the manufacturer part number as 1826-0075
which could be another typo.

<h3><A NAME="hst5519">Notes on the HP-5519 Two Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 5519A and 5519B are unique among all the (non-obsolete) HP lasers
in that they include an optical receiver for the return beam.  (The original
5500C also did but was considered too bulky for many applications.  The 5518A
also had an internal receiver but it has been superseded by the 5519A/B.  All
of the lasers include another optical receiver to monitor the output of the
laser but it does not have an external optical input.)  Like the 5500C and
the 5518A, the optical receiver enables them to be easily set up in
the field with only interferometer optics and a remote mirror or cube-corner
retro-reflector on a tool or other device whose motion needs to be measured.
In this regard, the 5519A/B also run on AC power, rather than the +/-15 VDC
required by the other HP lasers, so the cable to the electronics only needs
the REF and MEAS signals.  The 5519A and 5519B differ in the REF (beat)
frequency with the 5519A being similar to the 5517C and the 5519B being
similar to the 5517D.  (The 5518A had a REF frequency corresponding to
either a 5517A or 5517B depending on serial number.)
<p>
The case style of the 5519A/B (and 5518A) is similar to that of the 5517A
and the tube assembly is very nearly physically interchangeable.  The "very
nearly" means that a small piece of the tube assembly casting needs to be
cut away to provide clearance for the internal DC power supply, not present
on the 5517A or 5518A.  So, where the higher REF is not needed, a 5517A tube
assembly can be installed relatively easily.  Presumably, the modification
wouldn't be needed for the 5518A since it uses external DC power like the
5517A.)
<p>
The control electronics of the 5519A/B laser heads is functionally
the same as all the other thermally tuned HP lasers.  But the main PCB
is probably not interchangeable among the 5519A/B and the 5517A and
5518A.  The 5519A/B seems to have done away with any need for -15 VDC
unless it's generated on the main or connector PCBs as the built-in DC
power supply only provides +15 VDC.  And the 5517A may not have the
needed connections for the optical receiver of the 5519A/B.
<p>
Many photos of a 5519A laser head can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
(Version 2.31 or higher) under "Hewlett Packard HeNe Lasers".

<h3><A NAME="hst10780">HP-10780 Optical Receivers</A></h3>

There are several HP/Agilent optical receivers that are used as the detectors
for the return (reflected) beam in interferometry measurement systems.
The main differences are in their bandwidth and whether they have free-space
or fiber-coupled inputs.
<p>
The 10780A is used in interferometry systems using the 5501A,
5501B, 5517A, or 5517B laser heads. It contains a silicon photodiode
behind a focusing lens and polarizing filter oriented at 45 degrees, a
preamp, a comparator to generate a digital signal from the
heterodyne beat of the two polarized modes of the Zeeman-split
lasers, and a differential line driver.  The primary output is called
called "MEAS" and its complement "~MEAS".  There is also a Beam Indicator
LED which will be lit when there is enough power to produce a reliable
beat frequency signal.  (This threshold is adjustable.)  The
10780B appears substantially similar to the 10780A except that the
threshold pot is accessible without removing the receiver cover.
<p>
The pinout of the main connector (J1) is:
<p>

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  1 (LL,F)      1      ~MEAS (Zeeman beat signal pair from
  2 (UL,F)      2       MEAS  differential line driver.)
  3 (LR,M)      3      Return (also BNC shell and receiver case).
  4 (UR,M)      4      +15 VDC
</PRE>
<p>
The PCB pins are counted from the edge of the board.
I don't know the official designations of the pins on the funny bi-sex
4 pin BNC connector.  LL (Lower Left, etc., F for female and M for male)
reference the connector with the receiver oriented vertially - with the
optical input and Beam Indicator LED at the top.  (Rather than buying the
way overpriced mating cable, I fashioned a 2 pin female header for
power that fits only one way into the male pins, and a separate 2 pin
male header for the MEAS signal.  These were then glued into a
BNC shell.  It's not as pretty as the original but it works.  I have
not found any supplier for the mate that sounded like the cost would be
less than an arm and two legs for each one.
<p>
(Note that the 10791, one of the types of cables that is used to connect the
5517 laser heads to DC power and the measurement electronics, has a 4 pin
BNC plug like the one that mates with the optical receivers.  The REF outputs
of the laser are on the male pins with +15 VDC and GND on the female pins.
This connector should normally NOT be attached to the optical receiver!)
<p>
There is also an external test-point called "Beam Monitor" on a feed-through
pin sticking out above J1.  This is the intermediate rectified and filtered
signal used for the threshold detection.
<p>
The case should not be connected to the optical metal chassis or Earth
ground (I assume for single point grounding noise considerations).  Use
Nylon screws through the plastic insulated mounting holes at each end.
<p>
The 10780A and 10780B are now considered obsolete as they are not
guaranteed to work with 5517C/D and later interferometer lasers
over the full specified velocity range since the spec'd upper cutoff
frequency is too low (5 MHz).  However, HP/Agilent specs are often
very conservative.  A 10780A I tested using a function generator and
LED operated from below 40 kHz to over 8 MHz.
It actually would probably be usable down to around
10 kHz but the waveform was somewhat distorted below 40 kHz.  The
sensitivity as determined by the voltage on the Beam Monitor test-point
was down to about 50 percent of what it was at 5 MHz, but some of that
fall-off might have been due to my LED/driver.  The replacements are the
10780C (free space optical input) and 10780F (fiber optic input, though
some of these may actually have the 10780C model number and/or be
designated 10780U).  The 10780C
and 10780F have a guaranteed frequency range from 100 kHz to 7.2 MHz.  But for
experimental use, when using a single interferometer, or
when not requiring high velocity in one direction, the
10780A or 10780B should be fine and typically much less expensive
on eBay. :-)
<p>
Any of these HP receivers make good general detectors for optical heterodyne
beat signals within their frequency bandwidth since they will operate over a
wide range of input optical power from a few &micro;W to 1 mW or more without
adjustment.  They will also operate with similar optical pulsed signals and
work fine to detect the chopped drive of some of my LED flashlights! :)
However, note that although the 10780F/U can be used with free-space
input, to do so will require a polarizer at 45 degrees to be added, and since
there is no lens to focus the light onto the small area photodiode, the
maximum sensitivity is much lower than for the other optical receivers.

<h4><A NAME="hsthplc">Making HP Interferometer Cables</A></h4>

Rather than dedicating special and expensive genuine HP/Agilent cables
for each interferometer configuration, I am constructing adapter cables
to allow any 5517 (and 5518A) laser or 5508A display to be easily
attached to other parts of a system.  Each short adapter cable will
have the special HP circular male connector at one end and a DB25 female
connector at the other.  The DB25 will also have additional -15 VDC
pins reserved so that it could be used with similar adapters for the
5501A or 5501B lasers as well.

<p>
The Power, REF, and MEAS signals are also brought out to terminal blocks
so they can be monitored or easily attached to test equipment like a
frequency counter or oscilloscope, as well as the 5501A reference connector.
<p>
For testing 5517s (all versions) and 5518As, the 5508A is used directly with
the DB25 adapter.  For testing 5501As, a separate DC power supply is used but
with the 5508A powered and fed with REF and MEAS via the terminal blocks.
<p>
<b>5517/5508A connectors</b>
<p>
<p>
Since the circular MIL-Spec connector for the 5517/5508A is non-standard,
the connectors available from electronics distributors need to be modified.
The part number is PT06A-14-18P-SR with strain relief.  Mouser has them
for around $20 in single quanity, which is actually quite good as these things
go.  The modification turned out to be easier than I had anticipated.  The
pin block is made of rubber and can be pushed out with a piece of 1/2" copper
pipe in a drill press.  (Though a very slightly larger cylinder would be
a bit better.)  First, go around the periphery from both ends with a thin
blade which will free most of the rubber from the adhesive used to secure
it in place.  The pipe fits around the pins without mashing them and only
contacts the rubber.  Push in increments, making sure the rubber doesn't get
too misshapened or skewed in the process.  The screw-on strain relief (if
present) or some other suitable spacer with a hole in it will be
needed under the connector to allow the rubber block to be
pressed clear of the shell.  Then reinstall in a similar way after
aligning with respect to the 5517 or 5508A connector.  There will be
some damage to the rubber, but it should not affect anything unless
you're a purist.  Even without any adhesive, it's really snug enough but
won't be a Mil-Spec connector that's waterproof. :)
It would also be straightforward to fabricate a "punch" that matches
the pin pattern.  That may reduce collateral damage, but doesn't seem
to be worth the effort unless 1,000 of these connectors need to be
modified.
<p>
And a note about trying to salvage HP cables if all the required connections
aren't already present: Forget it.  The cover on the laser-end connector
consists of a thick rubber boot on top of a hard plastic conformal molded
inner core.  While the boot can be slit from end-to-end and peeled off,
I doubt it is realistic to remove the core without damage to the connector
and pins.  I gave up after seeing what would be involved since I didn't
have any TNT handy. :)  So, for example, an ET-319283 adapter cable
which has the 5517 connector at one end and a 7 pin LEMO at the other,
possibly intended to connect a 5519A/B to a 5508A Measurement Display
isn't useful to power a laser since the DC power connections are not present.
(The 5519A/B has a built-in switchmode power supply that runs off the
AC line.)
<p>
<b>5501A/B connectors</b>
<p>
The 5501A and 5501B use a pair of 4 pin circular connectors.  The
power connector is standard with a suitable mate being Amphenol
PT06-8-4P-SR.  (This is also available from Mouser, but is more
expensive than the 18 pin connector!)  The reference connector
has the keying rotated 45 degrees but a similar push out
and reinsert approach works, though more care is needed to assure
that the rubber doesn't get destroyed.  The diagnostic connector
(present only on the 5501A) mates with the standard PT06-14-18P-SR.
Unless you're into automated monitoring, building a cable for that is
probably not worth it.  See the sections on the 5501A/B, above, for
pinouts.

<h2>Laboratory for Science Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>

Laboratory for Science (LFS, now defunct) may have produced the best
commercial stabilized HeNe lasers based only on self (internal)
reference techniques - those that use feedback based on some property
of the laser itself like dual mode polarization and/or Zeeman splitting.
While higher precision lasers are available, they depend on external
devices like gas absorption cells or temperature controlled
Fabry-Perot resonators for the frequency reference.  As would be
expected, such equipment is much much more complex and expensive and
may require an engineer to be shipped along with the laser to adjust
and maintain it. :)

Scans of original product brochures for the Model 200, 220, and 260 lasers,
and html versions, as well as general desciptions and a price list can
be found at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage
Lasers and Accessories Brochures</A> under "Laboratory for Science".
The brochures include a nice description of the principles of operation
and applications considerations in addition to the specifications.
<p>
The following brief descriptions include extensive contributions from
David Woolsey (http://www.davidwoolsey.com/).)
<p>
There were three Laboratory for Science stabilized HeNe lasers known to have
been produced and sold:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Model 200 Ultra Stable HeNe Laser used basic two mode polarization
 stabilization like the SP-117A and others.  However, through clever design
 and attention to details, it substantially improved on both the short and
 long term performance compared to other commercial stabilized HeNe lasers
 by around a factor of 10 based on the specifications.
 An operation manual and note for the Model 200 can be found at
 <A HREF="http://www.ajaxelectronics.com/optics_info/manuals/">Ajax Electronics
 Laser/Optics Manuals</A> under "LFS".
<p>
<li>The Model 220 Ultra Stable HeNe Laser used the dependence of the Zeeman
 splitting beat frequency with respect to the neon gain center to set the
 lasing line position on the neon gain curve very precisely.  This improved
 on the already superb frequency stability of the Model 200 by perhaps a factor
 of 20, but by virtue of its digital synthesizer and configurable architecture,
 provided significantly greater flexibility as well.  The Model 220 was
 perhaps the highest performance stabilized HeNe laser ever available as a
 commercial product.
<p>
<li>The LFS-260 was a higher power stabilized HeNe laser which used the
 second order beat between the upper and lower longitudinal mode pairs
 with three modes oscillating.  It used the same controller as the Model 220
 but a higher voltage HeNe laser power supply and had frequency stability
 between the Models 200 and 220 but more than twice the output power.
 Gotta get me one of those. :)
</ul>
<p>
All three models had the same size power supply/control box but the laser
head for the Model 260 was longer than those for the models 200 and 220.
The user controls and general operating procedures are also basically the same
for all models.
<p>
A number of features and attention to detail set these lasers apart from
most other commercial stabilized HeNe lasers that are or have been available.
These are described with respect to each model in the following sections.
Unfortunately, clever ideas and implementation are often not the most
important factors in determining the success of a product or business.
<p>
Even with the superb technology, not many of any of these lasers were ever
sold.  The total production run for all the years of the product line from
the early 1980s to sometime in 1995 was
soemthing like: 300 for the Model 200, 60 for the Model 220, and only 10
for the Model 260.  There are references to other models ranging up to 280
in the product literature, but someone who actually worked at Laser
for Science throughout the years of ultra stable laser production
never heard of them going beyond the discussion stage.
<p>
Ironically, the extensive discussion of retro-reflections in the product
brochures may have scared off potential buyers.  Nearly half the text
in the brochures for the LFS-200, LFS-220, and LFS-260 is related to
the effects and mitigation of
retro-reflections which some people might interpret as a deficiency with
these lasers.  Retro-reflections are a problem with <i>all</i> lasers, but
especially with lasers designed to have the best stability performance.
Other manufacturers tend to simply mention retro-reflections in the
operation manual - not the product brochures! - as something to be
avoided, but even there, they don't dwell on it.
<p>
Even experienced laser jocks find it hard to understand how reflected light
with a power level 1/100,000,000 or less compared to the intra-cavity power
can have an effect on the behavior but it definitely can with these type
of lasers.
<p>

documentation for any of the Laboratory for Science lasers (or an actual
Laboratory for Science laser!) stached away they no longer need, please

<p>
The LFS-200 and LFS-220 are described in the order in which I acquired
samples.

<h3><A NAME="hstlfs220">Laboratory for Science Model 220 Ultra Stable HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The Model 220 uses a set of transverse (side-mounted) magnets to produce
Zeeman splitting of a single lasing line (at least over a range of positions
relative to the center of the gain curve).  This results in a
beat frequency in the 100 to 500 kHz range.  However, since the exact
beat frequency depends on the position relative to the center of the gain
curve of the single Zeeman-split lasing mode, a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) can
be used to park the lasing line very precisely, much more accurately than
with the common one or two mode stabilization techniques.  Even the
very expensive HP/Agilent 5501A/B (and other) metrology lasers used
the basic dual mode polarization stabilization technique, despite
being Zeeman lasers!  The approach of the Model 220 is probably about
as precise as possible short of the much more complex and expensive
ones using an iodine absorption cell or external Fabry-Perot resonator
for the reference.  None of the common stabilized HeNe lasers available
today like the SP-117A even come close.  And while that performance did
come at a price compared to a common HeNe laser, it was probably simlar
to that of other vanilla-flavored stabilized HeNe lasers.  In the early
1980s when the Model 220 first came out, the cost was under $5,000, though
a brochure from 1992 shows that the price had increased to $6,750.  But,
given the level of performance, they could probably have charged
2 or 3 times that price - and sold more of them! :)
<p>
Although LFS is now out of business, other companies do offer transverse
Zeeman stabilized HeNe lasers.  One example is
<A HREF="http://www.bluehilloptical.com/neoark.htm">NEOARK (Japan)</A>.
<p>
Among the features and attention to detail that sets the Model 220 laser
apart are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>High performance heater/transducer design using a longitudinal wiring
 configuration that assures a well behaved response and maximizes bandwidth.
<p>
<li>Custom wedge prism added to HR mirror to prevent even
 reflections of retro-reflections from entering laser cavity.
<p>
<li>Temperature regulated OC mirror to assure that there is a constant
 transmission without retro-reflection through the etalon formed by the
 mirror and AR coated front surface.
<p>
<li>Temperature regulated inner tube support frame and massive aluminum outer
 enclosure which is almost totally sealed to minimize effects of ambient
 conditions.
<p>
<li>Sophisticated tube suspension providing stress-free mounting without
 stick-slip noise.  The tube length will vary on a microscopic scale
 during regulation to compensate against external phase perturbations
 due to retro-reflection.
<p>
<li>Micrometer rotation adjustment to align tube birefringence axis with
 magnetic field.
<p>
<li>Custom HeNe laser tubes used in some versions (those made by Shasta Glass)
 with special bore support spiders that eliminate stick-slip noise due to
 expansion of the bore,
<p>
<li>Some or all tubes filled with isotopically pure gases like Ne<sup>20</sup>
 or Ne<sup>22</sup> to provide the narrowest linewidth and/or to select
 the precise line center frequency.
<p>
<li>Extensive pre-testing of all tubes to assure that mode cycling and
 Zeeman frequency changes are well behaved at all times.
<p>
<li>Specially designed low noise linear HeNe laser power supply to minimize
 power supply induced phase and amplitude noise.
<p>
<li>Self diagnostics like audio and oscilloscope monitoring of servo system
 signals to locate and eliminate sources of instability like retro-reflections.
<p>
<li>Maximum flexibility and configurability provided via a user interface
 connector to enable external modulation and control.
</ul>
<p>
The well known commercially available HeNe lasers I'm aware of implement
very few, if any of these.  And note that many duel frequency Zeeman
like the 5501A/B, 5517, and others, use simple dual polarization
mode stabilization techniques despite their being Zeeman lasers.
<p>
Scans of an original product brochure for the LFS-220 can be found
at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage
Lasers and Accessories Brochures</A> under "Laboratory for Science".
A much more compact html version is at
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/ls2br1.htm">Model 220
Ultra Stable Laser Brochure</A>.  The brochure includes a nice description
of the principles of operation and of course, the specifications.
<p>
The first Model 220 I (Sam) acquired on eBay - serial number 51 - has
IC date codes and PCB fab dates between 1981 and 1986.  But if the
serial numbers started at 1 (or even 10 as has been suggested) rather
than 50 and only 60 lasers were ever built, it may be much newer than
1986, possibly between 1988 and 1992.  So what if the chips are a bit
moldy, they haven't changed in any way other than dropping in price by
1 or 2 orders of magnitude since 1981. :) Maybe LFS bought their chips
from PolyPacks (a popular surplus outfit for cheap chips that also no
longer exists). ;-)
<p>
While the tube in this laser is weak - around 0.8 mW on a good day which
is about half the minimum power spec - this is more than adequate to provide
a stable beat frequency signal.  Originally, the laser was going through
what appeared to be normal warmup, but would not lock after the warmup
period and the Lock Level indicator came on.  The Model 220 has a headphone
jack to permit listening to the PLL error signal (as do the other models
as well) and a knob to adjust the PLL gain.  And while the knob
affected the sound in the headphones, there was little correlation with
anything else.  It was like a bad SciFi movie sound track!  I was thinking
there must be electronic problems preventing a stable lock from being
achieved.  Fortunately, all ICs are standard 4000-series CMOS and common analog
parts.  Unfortunately, it's not likely that a schematic will be available
given how few of these were probably built.  Google gas been totally incapable
of finding much of any useful information beyond the brochure for the Model
200 on David Woolsey's Web site and a few journel references citing the
use of Laboratory for Science lasers for such-an-such research.
<p>
However, a miracle happened.  Someone sent me the user manual for the Model 220
and lo and behold, that empty socket under the controller I had been pondering
since acquiring the laser needed a jumper plug to complete the internal signal
paths!  It provides access to all the critical input and outputs of the
internal architecture of the Model 220 controller with the intent to permit
the use of an external frequency reference, remote control and monitoring, and
other advanced functions.  The jumper block must have either fallen out
in shipping, or the previous owner had been using the remote hookup and
kept the cable.  No wonder it didn't work.  Nothing was connected together!
So there were electronic problems of sorts. :)
<p>
With the default jumper plug constructed and installed, *everything* started
working in a manner that actually made sense.  The Mode LED went on and off
as the modes cycled in the HeNe laser tube during warmup and the headphones
produced a satisfying chirp a couple times during each mode cycle.
When the 30 minutes or so warmup time was completed, the laser locked
instantly!
<p>
The sound from the headphones is nearly pure white noise and the
beat frequency appears rock stable on
an oscilloscope and around the 425.8317 kHz it should be based on the
PLL synthesizer BCD switch settings of 511.  (The frequency is: 3.4 MHz*m/M
where M is the switch setting and m is 32, 64, or 128, preselected based
on the laser tube to provide the maximum number of possible discrete Zeeman
frequencies.)  I intend to check it on a frequency counter but have little
doubt that will also show the correct frequency with crystal accuracy.
Unfortunately, I don't have a spectrum analyzer or an iodine stabilized
laser to check it more precisely.  The stability should increase is allowed
to warm up for longer - 90 minutes is the time to reach spec'd performance.
Originally, I thought it might not be working quite correctly due to
the sound from the headphone jack having rumbling and other non-white
noise components, but I now believe that may have been due to acoustic
feedback since I was actually listening using a stereo amp.

 uses the normal tube current for both heating and to power its circuitry.

 additional filtering in the control circuitry and careful PCB layout

 performance compared with typical HeNe laser power supplies.

<p>
<li><A HREF="lfs220c.jpg">LFS-220: PLL Controller PCB</A> The BCD rotary
 switches set the reference frequency.  It's nice that all the chips are
 common parts - CD4046 for the PLLs, other 4000-series CMOS for the rest
 of the digital stuff, and jelly beam op-amps and comparators.  And, they
 are socketed. :)  In 1981, each chip may have cost $10.  In 2006, I was
 able to order 2 to 3 times the needed quantity as spares for around $5
 <i>total</i>.  Two of the TO220 devices at the
 bottom-right are the DC power supply regulators, +/-12.5 and +22 VDC.
 The others are Darlington transistor drivers for preheat and normal
 operation of the tube heater.  During preheat, the heater
 is operated at a constant 1/2 to 2/3 max power while during
 normal operation, it is driven by the PLL to maintain lock.  The TO220
 device at the top-right provides a voltage limit (current bypass) for
 the Mode indicator light bulb which is in series with the heater so
 that when it burns out, the laser will still operate. :)
</ul>
<p>
The HeNe laser tube construction is nothing special, at least on the outside.
Like the two mode stabilized HeNe lasers, a Spectra-Physics 088-2 or similar
tube would work.  But the actual tube used by LFS was apparently custom built
though.  Some, if not all, were filled with isotopically pure Ne<sup>20</sup>
or Ne<sup>22</sup> to provide the narrowest linewidth and/or to select
the precise line center, and possibly He<sup>3</sup> as well.  Later ones
were made with a special bore support spider that eliminated the "slip-stick"
behavior during warmup of some other designs.
<p>
The waste beam from the HR-end of the tube is used for the reference
beat tone.  It has a polarizing filter between the tube and the photodiode
and a glued-on wedge to make sure the waste beam can't reflect
back into the bore.  There is an AGC circuit of sorts for the photodiode
so that a usable signal can be obtained as the tube ages regardless of
a (reasonable) decline in tube power.
<p>
The tube is rather elaborately suspended as can be seen in the photos.
The suspension provides some degree of vibration isolation and there
is even a fine thread screw (visible on the top of the laser head) to
rotate the tube by a few degrees.  The complex suspension was designed
to minimize stress in the glass envelope and eliminate stick-slip noise
due to length changes of the overall tube.  It also allowed the tube to be
rotated by a 100 pitch screw adjustment without twisting the tube at all.
This was desirable to align the tube's birefringence axis (mode orientation)
precisely with the magnetic field.
<p>
The entire laser head is thermally regulated by a
temperature controller which is the circuitry on the lone PCB inside
the head.  The temperature set-point can be adjusted via a pot accessible
from underneath the laser head.  Power resistors attached to the baseplate
on which the tube and magnet assembly is mounted provide the heating and
an LED on the rear panel of the laser head shows
the amount of power to the heater by its intensity.  The baseplate bolts
to the outer aluminum case with close-fitting end-plates.  Although perhaps
not obvious from the photos, the wall thickness is much greater than that
of most other HeNe lasers.
<p>
There is also a rather elaborate transducer attached to the tube.
While serving a similar function to the heaters on many mode stabilized
lasers, the design was optimized for fast response.  Power to this heater
is what is controlled by the PLL responsible for locking the laser.
<p>
The transducer consists of a dense "zig-zag" run of copper wire about 3.5
inches long Epoxied directly to the outside of the glass tube envelope. The  
wire is oriented (back and forth) along the long axis of the tube,  
*not* as a helix or coil (it is not an inductor).  When a current is run
through the winding the wire heats up and immediately pulls (stretches) the
glass with it. The response bandwidth is something like 10 kHz since the  
length change between the mirrors did not have to wait for the glass  
to heat up. With the wire arranged along the tube axis all of its  
change in length was in the intended direction - unlike with a the
the more common coil arrangement.
<p>
With a simple coil, the initial change in dimension when current is applied is
an increase in winding *diameter* which pulls the glass with it (expands the
tube diameter) and causes an initial *shortening* of the tube.  The
shortening is followed by a lengthening as the heat from the transducer
diffuses into the glass.  This is not a good way to make a fast feedback
loop.  Also unlike other heater schemes generally used, with the wire directly
attached to the tube glass, there is nothing in between to limit the response
as with taped on thin-film heaters.
<p>
On the anode-end of the HeNe laser tube (the front of the laser head
and output) is a collar with two LEDs on it and a trim pot.  Only the anode
wire connects to this collar.  One LED is lit when the tube is first
turned on.  Inside the collar is a temperature regulator for the output
mirror.  There is a small amount of internal reflection in the mirror
that gets back into the laser cavity and this is the way it was tamed.
There is a thermistor regulated heater in there that uses the
laser discharge current for power. The voltage drop across the heater
box will vary, but the current through it is held constant.  So, the
mirror temperature is regulated so that the etalon formed by its front
and rear surfaces has a peak covering the neon gain curve resulting in
a constant transmission without retro-reflections.  For the approiximately
5 mm thick mirror - 7.5 mm optical length - the FSR is 40 GHz, compared to
1.5 GHz for the Doppler-broadened neon gain curve.  So, the peak is rather
broad in comparison, but keeping it centered helps long term stability.
<p>
The rear mirror had a simple prism made of cover glass that was  
Epoxied onto it so that the internal reflection was removed by  
putting it off axis. The Epoxy was made to be thicker at one side  
than on the other by supporting one side of the cover glass with  
little tabs of tape.  This method couldn't be used on the output mirror.
<p>
When the output window is under proper thermal regulation both of the  
LEDs on the thermal regulator enclosure should be half lit.  The
upper one lit means heating and lower one lit means cooling.  
The pot adjusts the temperature set-point.
<p>
And note that neither anode or cathode is at ground potential!  Don't ask
how I (Sam) found this out. :( :)  This was apparently for noise suppression.
Grounding one end of the tube will risk inserting some 60 Hz hum onto the
tube current through ground loops and such.  Talk about paying attention
to every last detail!
<p>
The HeNe laser tube is driven by a linear power supply with totally exposed
components once the controller cover is removed.  Not even a plastic shield!
It is the typical voltage doubler with parasitic voltage multipler for
starting.  Four power transistors provide current regulation in the cathode
return.  While at first glance it looks similar to many other linear power
supplies of the early 1980s, it was designed to put out 5 mA at
1,200 Volts with a supply ripple of about 1 mV! That gives it a SNR of
around 127 dB. This was necessary in order to reduce the very small
fluctuations in laser power output due to supply ripple, and their
corresponding phase noise, to a minimum.  This was somewhat tricky
to do back then.  Specifically, the current regulation control circuit
has better components and additional filtering compared to common
commercial HeNe laser power supplies.  The PCB traces were also
apparently arranged to minimize pickup of hum and noise from the nearby
power transformers.  A partial schematic I traced of
the Model 200 HeNe laser power supply can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsclfs1">Laboratory for Science Model 220 Laser
Power Supply (LS-220)</A>.  I still need to determine the details of
the current regulation circuit (lower right in the schematic) but it's
diffiult to make out because the PCB can't easily be removed from the
controller case.
<p>
And speaking of details.  There are some zener diodes in the power
supply.  If they are clear glass, room light getting in via the
ventilation slots will end up modulating the power supply current,
so they should be painted or replaced!  Mine has the silver painted
variety so I guess it's OK.
<p>
The controller has two PLLs.  One is used as a frequency synthesizer to
produce a highly stable reference derived from a 3.4 MHz crystal.  The
reference frequency may be set via 3 rotary BCD switches accessible through
holes in the case.  The other PLL then locks the Zeeman beat to the reference
once the laser has reached operating temperature (about 1/2 hour).  Thus,
the reference determines the exact place on the neon gain curve where the
laser will operate.  (A little typewritten note on the unit I have states
that the center of the Ne<sup>20</sup> lasing line corresponds to a setting
of 511.)  So, maybe my laser tube is filled with isotopically pure gases.
<p>
There are 3 indicators on the front panel.  The "Lock Signal" lamp on
the right shows by its intensity, the approximate power to the heater
transducer attached to the tube.  The indicator on the left is called
"Reference" and is on all the time at relatively low intensity.  It is a
power indicator but at a reference brightness that should be similar to the
"Lock Signal" indicator when the laser is optimally stabilized.  The LED at
the top is called "Mode" and goes on and off during warmup as the modes
cycle.  When locked, it will be on at partial brightness.
<p>
A switch on the rear panel can be used to override the PLL output and select
heater at max or off, to adjust the lock temperature, either because the
tube is at too high or too low a temperature for stable locking, or should
it lock onto a "bad" point of the Zeeman frequency response function.
<p>
The headphone jack is used not only to check on the laser during warmup
and to confirm that stabilization has occurred, but also is a sensitive
detector of back-reflections, which may be a destabilizing influence.  Effects
of optics resulting in back-reflections will be heard as transient tones
in the headphones.  (The headphone output may also be connected to the "Line",
"CD", or "Tape" input of an audio amplifier.)  Waving anything in front of
the laser is audibly detectable, as are any sort of vibrations including
gently touching the laser or even the table it's on, or walking across the
floor.  If the output is piped through loud speakers, having the volume
above a very low level will result in acoustic coupling into the laser
tube and a very noticeable increase in audio level as well as a change more
toward non-white noise.
<p>
There is also a calibration jack which provides a beat frequency signal
and DC power source for the Model 225 Zeeman Beat Frequency Range Register,
whatever that is. :)
<p>

implementation quite closely, see the following patents.  (For the model

<p>
About two months after snagging the first LFS-220, I obtained another one,
also on eBay - serial number 36.  Its tube is a bit hard starting but has
slightly higher power than the first - about 1.1 mW.  After replacing 2
transistors and a diode which may have been bad or may have been killed when
I accidentally shorted the high voltage to the Mode light bulb socket (don't
ask!), it also works quite well.  Internal construction appears virtually
identical to SN 51.
<p>
At some point in the future, I plan to
combine the beams of the two LFS-220s and record and plot the frequency of
the beat signal to determine the actual stability.  I'll have to complain
to the LFS QC department if they don't meet published specifications!
<p>
I have also built an experimental setup using a normal barcode scanner
tube in a transverse magnetic field.  While turning this into a stabilized
transverse Zeeman laser is unlikely to occur, I have captured some plots of
it's behavior.  See the section: <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chndzees">Two
Frequency HeNe Lasers Based on Zeeman Splitting</A>.
<p>
I have acquired a scan of the operation manual for the Model 220 laser but
have not gotten permission to make it public as yet.  However, much of the
same technical information with respect to theory of operation can be found in
the brochures at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage
Lasers and Accessories Brochures</A> and in the patents.  In fact, the block
diagram in the operation manual is taken directly from Fig. 1 of Patent
#4,468,773.

<h3><A NAME="hstlfs200">Laboratory for Science Model 200 Ultra Stable HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The Model 200 uses the simpler and more common dual polarization mode control
technique for stabilization.  However, through innovative design and careful
attention to detail, it routinely achieves a frequency stability 5 to 10 times
better than other commercially available stabilized HeNe lasers.  At least
if one is to believe their specifications.
<p>
Among the features and attention to detail that sets the Model 200 laser
apart are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>High performance heater/transducer design using a longitudinal wiring
 configuration that assures a well behaved response and maximizes bandwidth.
<p>
<li>Custom beam pickoff assembly behind the HR mirror for the polarization
 mode signals includes an amber filter to block most tube discharge light
 from getting to the photodiodes and a quarter wave plate to prevent
 retro-reflections from the photodiodes.
<p>
<li>Temperature regulated OC mirror to assure that there is a constant
 transmission without retro-reflection through the etalon formed by the
 mirror and AR coated front surface.  (This is only present on later serial
 number Model 200s, or was added if the laser was returned for repair.)
<p>
<li>Temperature regulated inner tube support frame and massive aluminum outer
 enclosure which is almost totally sealed to minimize effects of ambient
 conditions.  This may be the most significant feature in terms of long term
 frequency stability.
<p>
<li>Sophisticated tube suspension providing stress-free mounting without
 stick-slip noise due to length changes of the overall tube.
<p>
<li>Custom HeNe laser tubes with special bore support spiders that
 eliminate stick-slip noise due to expansion of the bore.
<p>
<li>Extensive pre-testing of all tubes to assure that mode cycling
 is well behaved at all times (no flippers!).
<p>
<li>Specially designed low noise linear HeNe laser power supply to minimize
 power supply induced phase and amplitude noise.
<p>
<li>Self diagnostics like audio and oscilloscope monitoring of servo system
 signals to locate and eliminate sources of instability like retro-reflections.
</ul>
<p>
The well known commercially available HeNe lasers I'm aware of implement
very few, if any of these except for tube testing, which would be essential.
<p>
At the same time, the electronic implementation (see the schematics)
is a bit too simple and could benefit from a few things like an integrator
in the feedback loop and bypass capacitors!
<p>
There were also a few LFS-210s which added a 10 turn pot on the back that
provided adjustment of the mode position on the neon gain curve and thus
the optical frequency.
<p>
Scans of an original product brochure for the LFS-200 can be found
at <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage
Lasers and Accessories Brochures</A> under "Laboratory for Science".
A much more compact html version is at
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/ls0br1.htm">LFS Model 200
Ultra Stable Laser Brochure</A>.  The brochure includes a nice description
of the principles of operation and of course, the specifications.
<p>
Both the laser head and controller for the LFS-200 are superficially
identical to those of the LFS-220 except for the lack of a tube rotation
knob on the laser head.  Operation is generally similar as well, including
the use of the audio headphones for locating back-reflections.  However, the
tube lacks the heated OC mirror and of course, the additional rotation
hardware.  The shutter lever on the laser head selects among NP (Non
Polarized), off, and LP (Linear Polarized).  (This contrary to the manual
which says the latter is CP (Circular Polarized).
<p>
The interior of the laser head also differs in a number of ways.  The HeNe
laser tube appears to be a bit shorter than the one in the LFS-220 and the
anode is at the HR-end.  The mode pickoff optics and photodetectors are in
a little box behind the HR mirror with their premap mounted on the side.
There is an offset trimpot for the mode position accessible from under
the laser head.  The heaters and temperature controller are mounted on
the baseplate as with the LFS-220.
<p>
The controller box is arranged roughly the same way as for the LFS-220
but the locking circuitry is substantially simpler having a total of three
8 pin DIPs: LF412 and LM358 op-amps, and an LM2905 timer, presumably for the
warmup delay.  But there are 6 pots for adjustment (in addition
to the user accessible "volume control" servo gain knob).  The HeNe laser
power supply is similar to the one in the LFS-220 but several additional
high voltage filter capacitors have been added <i>on the Control PCB</i>
to zap the unsuspecting.  There is also an additional pot, as well as an
unidentified object in the vicinity of its control circuit, purpose unknown.
<p>
Here are some photos:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="lfs200s.jpg">Laboratory for Science Model 200 Ultra Stable HeNe

<p>
<li><A HREF="lfs200h.jpg">LFS-220: HR-End of Laser Head</A>. The tube
 has an adjustable mirror mount for the HR mirror but this is unlikely
 to ever need attention.  The pickup for the two mode signals is
 visible in the center of the photo.  Its cover has been removed
 revealing a pair of mirrors (just barely visible) to split the beam
 and a optics block which contains the polarizers to separate the two
 polarization modes, as well as a red filters and Quarter Wave Plates
 (QWPs) to suppress retro-reflections.  More on this below.  The two
 photodiodes at the right are on individually adjustable mounts
 (adjustment screws are visible in front of the PDs and underneath the
 plate).  The cylindrical object underneath the black pickup housing
 is a rotary spring which, along with the spring visible to the right
 of it, provides the restoring force for the horizontal adjustments.
 The springy plates provide the restoring force for the vertical
 adjustments.  The PDs are connected to a preamp PCB at the upper
 right.  The lone red wire sticking up is from the tube anode (at this
 end in the case of the LFS-200), but its yellow plug floated up to
 the ceiling and its end is not visible.  It attaches to the ballast
 resistor which is mounted on the end-plate.  The heater PCB is well
 hidden behind the black connector.  (Note that for this and the next
 photo, I did not remove the inner frame from the case, as with the
 LFS-220.)
<p>
<li><A HREF="lfs200o.jpg">LFS-220: OC-End of Laser Head</A>  One of the heater
 pass transistors and heater resistor can be seen fastened to the baseplate.
<p>
<li><A HREF="lfs200p.jpg">LFS Model 200: HeNe Laser Power Supply</A> This is a
 linear HeNe laser power supply with 4 pass transistors and a trimpot

 unidentified component in the lower right corner of the PCB.  The power
 transformer in the middle of the chassis is for the low voltage DC
 supplies while the one on the left is for the HeNe laser power supply
 high voltage.  Various design features including additional filtering
 in the control circuitry and careful PCB layout to minimize pickup of
 inductively coupled hum and noise give it much performance compared
 with typical HeNe laser power supplies.  There
 are also several additional high voltage filter capacitors located on
 the Control PCB (next photo).  Apparently the original power supply
 wasn't quite good enough!
<p>
 There were several versions of this power supply, at least two without the
 additional pot and its circuitry, and another with the 4 extra capacitors
 mounted on the same PCB.
<p>
<li><A HREF="lfs200c.jpg">LFS Model 200: Mode Controller PCB</A> The
 stabilization circuitry consists of a pair of dual op-amp ICs: LF412 and
 LM358.  There is also an LM2905 timer for the warmup delay.  But, as can
 be seen there really isn't much to the controller.
 Two of the TO220 devices at the
 bottom-right are the DC power supply regulators, +/-12.5 and +22 VDC.
 The others are Darlington transistor drivers for preheat and normal
 operation of the tube heater.  During preheat, the heater
 is operated at a constant 1/2 to 2/3 max power while during
 normal operation, it is driven by the mode control feedback to
 maintain lock.  The TO220
 device at the top-right provides a voltage limit (current bypass) for
 the Mode indicator light bulb which is in series with the heater so
 that when it burns out, the laser will still operate. :)
 And those large electrolytic capacitors
 are part of the HeNe laser power supply waiting to zap the unsuspecting! :)
</ul>
<p>
The designers at Laboratory for Science appear to be more obsessed with
retro-reflection or back-reflection (same thing) than at any other stabilized
laser company.  This is understandable considering the higher level of
performance that is being achieved with the higher bandwidth servo
system more sensitive to cavity perturbation.  For example, while
other stabilized HeNe lasers will simply use a polarizing beam
splitter or two to separate the modes making sure to angle all
reflective surfaces to prevent back-reflection, the LFS-200 has added
the QWPs after the polarizers.  The optics stack sandwich for each
mode visible in the photo of the HR-end of the LFS-200, above, is
something like:
<p>
<PRE>
  Plexiglas back-plate | Amber filter | Polarizer | QWP | Plexiglas front-plate -> PD
</PRE>
<p>
Two passes through the QWP (out and back) result in a 90 degree rotation of the
polarization axis so any reflected light is blocked by the polarizer.

<h4><A NAME="hstlfs200s">Schematics of Laboratory for Science Model 200 Controller</A></h4>

Here are schematics for most of what is in the control box including
the HeNe laser power supply and stabilization circuitry.  There are two
sheets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="lfs0hsch.pdf">LFS-200 HeNe Laser Power Supply PCBs</A>.
 This is a basic linear power supply with some additional filtering
 on the positive side, apparently as an afterthought. :)  It will run
 fine without the Aux Cap PCB.  A link to this file is also present
 in the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsclfs0">Laboratory for Science
 Model 200 Laser Power Supply (LS-200)</A>.
<p>
<li><A HREF="lfs0csch.pdf">LFS-200 Control PCB</A> This includes the
 low voltage regulators, warmup timer, analog feedback loop,
 and heater driver.  The stabilization uses only proportional
 feedback with user adjustable gain.  The "Feedback Polarity" switch
 is internal.
</ul>
<p>
There is also a significant amount of electronics in the
laser head including the laser head temperature controller and
photodiode amplifiers.  Reverse engineering those would require ripping
apart a laser head - something I'm not planning on doing any time soon.
<p>
Note that there were many engineering changes over the course of manufacturing
relatively few lasers, with little if any documentation or revision numbering
on the PCBs.  So, don't be alarmed if there are discrepancies between the
schematics and the PCBs in your laser!

<h3><A NAME="hstlfsc">Some Comments From David Woolsey</A></h3>

The manufacture date is probably closer to the mid or late 1980s for  
your LFS-220 SN# 51.
<p>
The tube in the 260 was 15 inches long. It lased on three modes,  
giving it a more complex inter-combinational beat frequency pattern.  
About 50% of the power was in the central mode and a polarizer could  
be used to discard the other two modes since they were polarized  
orthogonally to it. This would get rid of the beats.
<p>
Some of the tubes were filled with single isotopic neon. Most were  
not.  The isotopic mix did not depend on the model type though.
<p>
The tubes used in some of the later lasers were custom made by Shasta  
Glass (R.I.P.). These tubes had a specially designed capillary support  
"spider" that produced no "stick-slip" noise as the tube changed  
length under regulation.  Other than that, there was nothing any  
different between the tubes used in the Laboratory for Science lasers and  
the tubes used in supermarket barcode scanners. We did exploit mirror defects  
that were typical of the type of laser tube though. Some types of  
sputtering artifacts can make a laser less prone to mode hopping.  
Also, since the mirrors were imperfect, there was a small amount of  
birefringence in them that we exploited as well.  They were cheap tubes,
but with lots of sorting and characterizing.  We used about 2/3 of  
the tubes we bought.
<p>
The transducer was one of the fundamental, and patented, ideas that  
made the Laboratory for Science lasers better than any others.  All the  
lasers used the same transducer system.  One of the other patents was
related to the phase locked loop electronics on the Model 220.  (See the
patent list above.)
<p>
A Model 220 was used by IBM in the first Atomic Force Microscope
(AFM). The Model 220 could be used to measure distance changes on the
order of 1/20 of an Angstrom right out of the box. Compare that to
what the "competing" HP laser could do ("Position/distance resolution
down to better than 10 nm") and then compare the price tags.
<p>
NASA bought a 260 for the robot that they made to test the tiles on  
the Space Shuttle. The robot had a YAG laser to hit the tile with a  
high power pulse that, due to the resulting thermal shock, would make  
the tile ring. The 260 was used to detect the ring modes. All this  
was done without contact or close proximity to the surface.
<p>
If you need a tube replacement, the right thing to do is contact Dr.  
Seaton.  He may be able to supply you with one (even though the Lab is  
nominally out of business). It'll cost a bit over $1,000 installed, I
would guess.  There are quite a number of subtle things about tube  
replacement and it is best left up to someone who has done it before  
(unless you consider your time to be of very little value).
<p>
Why aren't there other lasers like these available today?
<p>
There are much simpler solutions available now for lasers with a  
coherence length of a few hundred meters. Distributed FeedBack (DFB) diode  
Lasers can have coherence lengths of a couple hundred meters, power  
outputs of many times what the Model 200 put out, cost much less than  
the Model 200, turn on and stabilize quicker, and don't die as easily when  
abused.  (However, DFB lasers do not provide a self-referenced absolute
frequency, as do stabilized HeNe lasers. --- Sam.)
<p>
As for the Model 220, I am not quite sure why nobody is making an  
equivalent system now. I suppose that there is just no significant  
demand for 1 mW of optical power with 20 km of coherence length.  
Also, there is only so much that modern manufacturing will get you in  
this case because there is just too much "hand tweaking" that went  
into these lasers.
<p>
LFS could have charged 2 or 3 times as much as they did
and not lost sales.  There was no place else to turn, short of much more
complex and expensive iodine stabilized lasers and such, for the 220 and
260 levels of performance.  The Lab almost got involved in making an iodine
stabilized system. I think I recall Dr. Seaton claiming that it would have
something like 0.01 Hz stability.

<h2>Laseangle Stabilized HeNe lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hstlarb1"> Laseangle RB-1 Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

Laseangle was a company that built some stabilized HeNe lasers in the
early 1980s.  I don't know if they ever actually sold anything commercially
but they are immortalized by a reference in a paper to the use of 6 of their
systems.  Perhaps, the researchers were related to the company founder. :)
<p>
The RB-1 consisted of two pieces.  The first RB-1 I saw had laser head
SN# 1 and controller SN# 2, so at least two of
these systems were built and I had mismatched pieces.  However, I have
photos (below) of RB-1 SN# 8 with very similar
construction, which still looks like someone's science fair project. :)
The thing clearly wouldn't be caught dead
going out to a paying customer, though it's likely that the RB-1
or its successor eventually morphed into the Newport NL-1 (maybe "Newport
Laseangle 1"?) as a result of a merger or buy-out.  However, I've yet to
see an actual NL-1 (or production RB-1 if there ever was such a thing).
<p>
The RB-1 laser head contains the HeNe laser tube, with
wrap-around heater, a beam sampler assembly that diverted all of one
polarization to a photodiode and part of the orthogonal polarization to
another photodiode, and preamps for the photodiodes.  The base is
a 3/4 inch thick aluminum slab with a 1/8 inch aluminum cover sealed
with foam rubber.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube was from Uniphase, a garden variety model with a
length of about 8 inches, which is somewhat unusual, probably rated around
2 mW.  A tube length of 6 or 9.5 inches being more common, at least today.
<p>
The beam sampler includes a polarizing beamsplitter cube to extract
one of the mode signals and prevent it from reaching the output at all,
and a separate angled plate to extract a portion of the orthogonal mode.
A pair of EG&G SGD-100A photodiodes (may be similar to the Perkin Elmer
FFD-100) fed LF356 op-amps.
<p>
The controller houses a linear DC power supply, standard Laser Drive HeNe
laser power supply brick, feedback circuitry, and
heater driver.  There were controls on the front clearly not for an
end-user, like 8 or 10 gain settings and a fine gain control for one
of the op-amps, selection of which mode signal to pass to an output, a
current meter for the heater, and so forth.  People who typically use
these things would have no clue of what to do with the knobs and switches.
I've yet to see a user manual for the RB-1.
<p>
While the mounting of the HeNe laser tube is somewhat overkill and the
beam sampler is a nice solid unit with an adequate number of adjustments,
the electronic construction of both the laser head and controller are,
to put it politely, a disaster.  Everything is on those copper strip
prototyping boards, with capacitor upon capacitor added in various
places no doubt to tame noise pickup or instability.  (Someone must have
had stock in a capacitor company!)  The designers must
have had a goal of using strange and hard to find connectors wherever
possible which they did for the separate cables of the photodiode signals
(blue multipin) and heater drive (microphone two pin).   Power for the
HeNe laser tube in SN#s 1 and 2 came from a standard Alden on the controller
but at the laser head had both the medium voltage BNC on top for the
positive and the normal BNC on the bottom for the negative.
In SN# 8, the high voltage cable is hard-wired into the laser head.
Maybe the engineers were getting zapped too often. :)
<p>
Here is a composite photo of SN# 1/2:

<h2>Mark-Tech Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hstmt1">Mark-Tech 7900 Frequency Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

<A HREF="http://www.marktechlaser.com/">Mark-Tech Laser, Inc.</A>
is a maker of stabilized HeNe lasers and other laser
related equipment for measurement, tooling, and alignment.  It's not
clear how active they are.  The Mark-Tech Web site is somewhat in a state
of disrepair and the contact email address is through AOL. :)
<p>
The 7900 is a dual mode polarization stabilized laser essentially
similar to the Coherent 200, Spectra-Physics 117/A, and others.
It consists of a rectangular laser head
which contains the controller and HeNe laser power supply, and a
separate box with DC power supplies and possibly a status indicator.
<p>
The specifications and a photo for the 7900 can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.marktechlaser.com/mark_tech/7900.htm">Mark-Tech
Model 7900 Frequency Stabilized Laser</A>.  And the 7910 at
<A HREF="http://www.marktechlaser.com/mark_tech/7910.htm">Mark-Tech
Model 7910 Frequency Stabilized Laser</A>
<p>
The HeNe laser tube appears to be a Uniphase 098-2 or similar, 2 to 3 mW.
It uses a Laser Drive power supply.
<p>
The one interesting difference between the 7900 and most other similar
lasers is that the heater to control the length of the HeNe laser tube
is painted or coated on the outside of the tube, rather than being a
thin film heater or wound with wire.  This should potentially
have a more predictable response and thus lower frequency/phase noise
once locked.
<p>
During initial warmup, the controller runs the heater at rather high
power until a reference temperature is reached, and then closes the feedback
loop.  Since it doesn't need to wait for the temperature to reach
equilibrium, this greatly reduces the lock time to under 5 minutes.
This is similar to that of the HP/Agilent lasers which use custom and
expensive HeNe laser tubes which have an internal heater wrapped around
the bore.  Most other stabilized HeNe lasers using off-the-shelf tubes take 10
to 20 minutes to lock.  The tube does run rather hot though, but this
is probably normal.
<p>
The stabilization feedback is implemented in 2 op-amps with some other stuff to
monitor the heater temperature, do the switchover from preheat to
feedback mode, and generate status signals.
<p>
The output power when locked on the sample I have is about 0.9 mW.
(The spec'd minimum locked power is 0.5 mW.)  So, this one appears to
be basically in like-new condition even though it has a manufacturing
date of 1984 making it 24 years old, with a serial number of 112.  And
I bet they started at SN 100! :)
<p>
In addition to connections for +/-15 VDC and ground, there are a pair of
status signals from the laser head.  One goes high (around +12 VDC)
a few seconds after the laser locks.  The other is open collector,
and turns on at the same time.  However, this signal will start
pulsing if the lock is interrupted - for example, if the beam to
the photodetectors is momentarily blocked.  The pulsing continues
even after lock is re-established.
There is a third signal, also open collector, that is always on.
I have no idea what that does.
<p>
Here is the pinout for the circular connector (J5, mating connector
is AMP/Tyco part number 206434-1 with possible pin part number 66507-9).
The same pin numbering is also used on the internal PCB header:
<p>

   6     Lock/Error (Blink)     OC, on when locked, 2 Hz for loss of lock.
   7     Lock                   Low initially, +12 VDC when locked.
   8     Unknown                OC, on all the time.
</PRE>
<p>
(There are two similar circular connectors on this laser but only one of them
is wired to anything internally.)
<p>
The same case seems to be used for a fancier Mark-Tech laser as there are
obvious tapped hole locations for mounting additional optics and other
stuff.  This may be for the model 7910 which appears to be an
interferometer laser used in measurement/calibration systems.
However, unlike those for similar applications
from HP/Agilent and Zygo, it is probably
NOT a two-frequency Zeeman laser but simply a model 7900 with an internal
optical receiver using simple quadrature A/B fringe counting in the
interferometer.  See
<A HREF="http://www.marktechlaser.com/mark_tech/7910.htm">Model 7910

 braid.  The main beam exits to the left, passes through a polarizing
 beam-splitter cube which diverts one polarization axes to a solar cell
 detector, then through a beam sampler to get the other polarization axis,
 and then is reflected back down the case to the output aperture.  Unused
 holes and a milled recess probably intended for additional components
 used in the Model 7910 are clearly visible on the plate behind the laser

<h2><A NAME="hstmgst">Melles Griot Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A></h2>
<h3><A NAME="hstmgst0">Melles Griot 05-STP-901 Frequency and Intensity Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

Melles Griot used to offer several frequency and/or intensity stabilized HeNe
lasers.  Some had the stabilization circuitry built in to the laser head,
only requiring a HeNe laser power supply and source of low voltage DC to
run - these were all derived from the Aerotech Syncrolase design.
(See the section: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstatsl1">Aerotech Syncrolase 100</A>.
However, the stabilized laser with the highest performance (and no doubt
highest price) was the 05-STP-901 which consists of a controller box and
separate HeNe laser head.  This is actually a Spectra-Physics 117A system in
every respect except for the front panel layout and the color of the paint
job.  In fact, the circuit boards inside have Spectra-Physics 117 "Fab" and
"Assy" numbers!  The circuit diagrams may be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstsp117s">Schematics of Spectra-Physics Model 117A
Controller</A>.  Everything here is past tense because this laser is no longer
offered by either Melles Griot or Spectra-Physics, since taken over by Newport
and they now sells a stabilized HeNe laser from REO!

The specifications for the SP-117A should be similar.
<p>
The unit I acquired is of relatively recent manufacture (as these things go) -
1996.  The only major problem I found with it was a dead HeNe laser power
supply brick - a Laser Drive unit rated 4.5 mA at 1,600 V, similar to the one
in the SP-117.  It appears to be a standard model except for a hand-printed
label with "0.03 percent noise".  So, it's either built with better filtering
or is specially selected  for this application from standard units.
Using an external HeNe laser power supply temporarily allowed
the controller to be tested.  However, it appears to be much more finicky
than the original SP-117 in Frequency Mode and would only stabilize with one
of my SP-117-compatible laser heads.  It basically ignored one that had a
slightly leaky photodiode and my home-built clone, simply turning on the
"Locked" LED but not actually doing anything.  All three of these laser heads
stabilize reliably on the much older SP-117 controller.  I suspect that an
adjustment of the gain of the photodiode preamps would take care of this -
probably just turning it up all the way.  So, perhaps I shouldn't be so
hard on it. :)
<p>
Switching to Intensity Mode at first resulted in the heater simply turning on.
The offset pot had to be adjusted to get the mode signals to be in the required
range for the locking circuitry to operate, but then it would lock with
perhaps 30 seconds required to settle down.
<p>
Switching from Frequency to Intensity Mode or back caused the Locked LED to
flash and the Locked relay to chatter for a few seconds.  This seems to be
normal behavior, as it happens on every one of these lasers I've seen.
(The Locked relay provides a set of SPDT contacts that can be used to
control auxiliary equipment, though there is no external connector for it.
But a cable could be wired to the PCB pads and snaked out through the
ventilation slots on the bottom of the case.)
<p>
Monitoring the heater drive signal on an oscilloscope shows how sensitive
this feedback scheme really is. Even playing music at a moderate level
evoked a detectable response.  Tapping on the concrete floor resulted in
an oscillation that took a few seconds to die out.
<p>
The electronic design of the SP-117A and 05-STP-901 clearly has it
roots in that of the SP-117 (no A) but in addition to the added circuitry for
the intensity mode, the frequency control loop has been upgraded to a pure
integrator (with a few additional op-amp stages).  The PCB layout is
completely new and TL084s have replaced LF347s.  But much of it looks
like it is unchanged from the SP-117 design.  The heater drive is a crude
pulse width modulator rather than linear pass transistor.  Considering
the care with which the PCB is laid out with separate analog and digital
grounds and linear everything else, it seems strange to have this source
of high level digital noise.  And, in fact, the varying heater current
results in either thermal or magneticly induced vibration of the tube.
This can be detected in the spectrum of the laser output if one looks
hard enough.  For example, if it is heterodyned with another clean laser.
(An upgrade is described later to eliminate this.)The input is +12 VDC from
a linear power supply.  A source of +9 VDC is provided by a LM317 linear
regulator.  A 555 timer generates the PWM clock and also the -9 VDC power
via a charge pump.  These power most of the analog circuitry.
Timing delays are implemented using several CMOS monostables.  Grrrr. :)
<p>
Also see the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstsp117a">SP-117 and SP-117A Stabilized Single
Frequency HeNe Lasers</A> for more details of the electronics including
complete schematics for both the SP-117 and SP-117A/05-STP-901.

<h4><A NAME="hstmgst1">Adjustment of 05-STP-901/SP-117A and SP-117</A></h4>

The following also applies without changes to the Spectra-Physics 117A,
and includes info for the SP-117 as well.
<p>
For best performance, the controller should be adjusted to match a
the specific laser head.  (Intensity mode may not work at all if swapping
heads without readjustment.)  There are only three pots inside, so this
isn't that complex a procedure!  Remove the cover by taking out the
4 Philips-head screws on the bottom near the feet at the edge of the
case.
<p>
First, power up the laser and check the 12 VDC power supply at the
mainboard PCB connector.  There are two pots on the power supply PCB.
The one closer to the HeNe laser power supply-side is the voltage
adjust.  (The other one is unlikely to need adjustment.)
You'll need a tiny right angle flat blade screwdriver or
bent flat hairpin turn the pot.  Set the voltage for 12 V +0.25/-0.0 V.
<p>
<b>Adjustment procedure for MG-05-STP-901 and SP-117A:</b>
<p>
Pots R9 and R10 (500K ohms) set
photodiode preamp gain while R13 (50K ohms) sets balance in INTENSITY
mode.  All measurements should be made with respect to AGnd (TP7).
An oscilloscope is desirable for the INTENSITY mode adjustments but not
essential.
<p>
It's possible that an earlier PCB revision of the MG-05-STP-901 or SP-117A may
have different parts designations.  In particular, the SP-117 - no "A" -
has other part numbers but it should be obvious which pots and test points
to use.
<p>
<b>FREQUENCY mode</b>:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Power up the laser in FREQUENCY mode and monitor TP3 with respect to
 AGnd (TP7) using a voltmeter
 or oscilloscope.  The signal on TP3 is the output of the preamp for one of
 the photodiode channels and should vary from near 0 V to as much as
 9 V in a cycle that takes a few seconds (increasing in length as the
 tube heats up and expansion slows).  Adjust R9 so the peak is about 6 V
 or as much as possible if it won't go that high.  Where the laser head
 is weak and it won't reach 6 V, just set the pot fully CW.  The laser
 seems to lock even with only 2 or 3 V max for the photodiode signals.
<p>
<li>Monitor TP6 and do the same for R10, the other photodiode channel.
 It's more important that the signal amplitudes be equal than maximum.
 So, for a weak tube where the signal amplitudes can't both be set for
 6 V, the pot for the smaller one should be fully CW and the other pot
 should be set to make them equal.
<p>
 The LOCKED LED should not be on at this point (even if it was before the
 adjustments were made).
<p>
<li>Give the system time to stabilize (about 15 to 20 minutes from a cold
 start).  The LOCKED LED should come on and then within a minute or
 so, the output should be stabilized with the voltages on TP3 and TP6
 approximately equal and quite constant.  Note that the exact values will
 change somewhat as the tube warms up and its output power changes,
 especially if the photodiode signal amplitudes are not equal.
<p>
 The system is basically working at this point but for the final    
 adjustments, let it remain this way for at least another hour to give
 everything time to warmup fully.
<p>
<li>Very *Carefully* install a jumper between the base of Q1 (LM395T, TO220
 package) and DGnd (TP11).  This disables the heater and allows the tube to
 cool causing the modes to cycle again.  (The LOCKED LED may go off or
 start flashing.)
<p>
<li>Check that the voltages on TP3 and TP6 don't go above about 8 V (since
 the HeNe laser tube may produce slightly more power when it is at operating
 temperature) - readjust R9 and R10 if required to prevent clipping.
<p>
<li>Remove the jumper.  The system should reacquire lock.
<p>
<li>Fine tune R9 or R10 so that the voltages on TP3 and TP6 are equal,
 giving the system a few seconds to reach the stable position between
 adjustments.
<p>
<li>If it is desired to use both the S and P polarized modes from the output,
 the Polarizing Beam-Splitter (PBS) rhombus (a squashed cube!) must be removed
 from the end of the laser head.  Loosen the setscrews at the very end of the
 laser headn and pull off the end-cap.  Remove the two screws holding the
 PBS assembly in place and pull it out.  Replace the end-cap, and tighten
 the setscrews.
<p>
 Use the PBS rhombus or any polarizer to compare the power in the two
 modes.  (There should be a mark on the laser head case to indicate the
 plane of polarization.)  If it isn't adequately equal, adjust R9 or R10
 to make it so.  Only a series of small adjustments should be needed,
 giving the system a few seconds to reach the stable position.
</ol>
<p>
<b>INTENSITY mode</b>:
<p>
This adjustment can be done without electronic test equipment but it's much
quicker with at least a DMM and easier with an oscilloscope:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Allow the laser to warm up and lock with the stabilization keylock
 switch in the FREQUENCY position.
<p>
<li>Measure the voltage on TP10 (PWM Ramp) and note its value (minimum and
 maximum if using a scope).
<p>
<li>Monitor the voltage on TP9 (HDrv).
<p>
<li>Switch the stabilization keylock switch to the INTENSITY position.
<p>
<li>Give the system a few seconds to settle down.  If the voltage on TP9
 is below the minimum of the ramp or above the maximum of the ramp, slowly
 adjust R13 to bring it within that range.  (If without a scope, set it
 close to the measured value on TP10.)  If the voltage on TP9 remains between
 the ramp limits, the system has already locked and adjustment may not be
 needed.
<p>
<li>Monitor the voltage on TP16 (Htr On).  It should be an approximately
 500 Hz PWM signal (not a constant value) whose duty cycle is varying to
 maintain the laser stabilization.  If measuring with a DMM, the voltage
 should be somewhere between 0 V and 9 V (but not at either extreme) and
 also varying.  It may take a minute or more for it to settle down but if
 nothing happens, try readjusting R13 slightly higher or lower.
<p>
<li>It should be possible to do fine adjustment of R13 to place the
 INTENSITY mode operating point either equal to that of the other mode,
 or fairly close to the peak of the gain curve.  However, going too close
 will result in loss of lock and the inability to lock when switching
 modes.  And, when switching on from a cold start where the output power of the
 laser tube is lower, it may not lock at all in INTENSITY mode
 until it warms up.
<p>
<li>Confirm that the system reliably reacquires lock when switching
 from FREQUENCY to INTENSITY mode and back again.
</ol>
<p>
Here is the procedure without electronic test equipment, but a laser power
meter (or calibrated eyeball) and polarizer will be required:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Allow the laser to warm up and lock with the stabilization keylock
 switch in the FREQUENCY position.
<p>
<li>Rotate R13 to its counterclockwise until it is at the end (will
 probably start clicking).
<p>
<li>Move the Stabilization keylock switch to the INTENSITY position.  The
 polarized mode will start changing as the controller hunts for a
 stable position.
<p>
<li>Rotate R13 clockwise in 1/2 turn increments, waiting a few seconds
 after each while monitoring the laser output power in one polarized mode.
 At some point, the polarized mode will change its behavior and the laser
 should then lock.
<p>
<li>It should be possible to do fine adjustment of R13 to place the
 INTENSITY mode operating point either equal to that of the other mode,
 or fairly close to the peak of the gain curve.  However, going too close
 will result in loss of lock and the inability to lock when switching
 modes.  And, when switching on from a cold start where the output power of the
 laser tube is lower, it may not lock at all in INTENSITY mode
 until it warms up.
<p>
<li>Confirm that the system reliably reacquires lock when switching
 from FREQUENCY to INTENSITY mode and back again.
</ol>
<p>
Further adjustment is left as an exercise for the student and your mileage
may vary. :)
<p>
<b>Adjustments procedure for SP-117:</b>
<p>
The SP-117 only has FREQUENCY mode, which is functionally identical to
FREQUENCY mode of the SP-117A.  There are also 3 pots.  R11 and R13
(the two 500K pots) are equivalent to R9 and R10 of the SP-117A with R12 (the
50K pot) adjusting the position on the gain curve.  I do not know why a similar
function to this last pot isn't included in the SP-117A.  Or, perhaps it is and
my schematics have errors.  Errors?  Nah. :)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Set R12 to approximately mid-range.
<p>
<li>Power up the SP-117 and monitor TP8 with respect to AGnd (TP6) using a
 voltmeter or oscilloscope.  The signal on TP8 is the output of the preamp
 for one of the photodiode channels and should vary from near 0 V to
 as much as 9 V in a cycle that takes a few seconds (increasing in length
 as the tube heats up and expansion slows).  Adjust R11 so the peak is
 about 6 V or as much as possible if it won't go that high.  Where the
 laser head is weak and it won't reach 6 V, just set it fully CW.  The laser
 seems to lock even with only 2 or 3 V max for the photodiode signals.
<p>
<li>Monitor TP7 and do the same for R13, the other photodiode channel.
 It's more important that the signal amplitudes be equal than maximum.
 So, for a weak tube where the signal amplitudes can't both be set for
 6 V, the pot for the smaller one should be fully CW and the other pot
 should be set to make them equal.
<p>
 The LOCKED LED should not be on at this point (even if it was before
 the adjustments were made).
<p>
<li>Give the system time to stabilize (about 15 to 20 minutes from a cold
 start).  The LOCKED LED should come on and then within a minute or
 so, the output should be stabilized with the voltages on TP5 and TP6
 approximately equal and quite constant.
<p>
 The system is basically working at this point but for the final
 adjustments, let it remain this way for at least another hour or so to give
 everything time to warmup fully.
<p>
<li>While alternately monitoring each of the photodiode channels, or
 better yet, the actual laser output for each polarization, very slowly
 adjust R12 to make them equal.  This places the stabilization setpoint
 at the optimal location on the gain curve.  R12 can also be used to move it
 elsewhere if desired.  Note that this point will change somewhat as the
 tube warms up and its output power changes, especially if the photodiode
 signal amplitudes are not equal.
<p>
<li>Very *Carefully* install a jumper between the base of Q1 (LM395T, TO220
 package) and DGnd (TP17).  This disables the heater and allows the tube to
 cool causing the modes to cycle again.  (The LOCKED LED may go off or
 start flashing.)
<p>
<li>Check that the voltages on TP8 and TP7 don't go above about 8 V (since
 the HeNe laser tube may produce slightly more power when it is at operating
 temperature) - readjust R11 and R13 if required to prevent clipping.
<p>
<li>Remove the jumper.  The system should reacquire lock.
</ol>

<h4><A NAME="hstmgst2">Reducing Electronics-Induced Frequency Ripple in
 SP-117/A Lasers</A></h4>

For some applications that require the ultimate in a nice stabilized laser,
minimizing optical frequency variation is of fundamental importance.
Gross variations in optical frequency are due environment conditions like
temperature and pressure, mechanical effects like vibration, and drift of
electronic components.  But there may be small periodic variations in
optical frequency due to the electronic design.
The only practical ways to detect this would be either by heterodyning
the laser's output with a known clean laser or by testing with a super
high finesse Fabry Perot interferometer.  The beat frequency
would not be a pure tone and would have typical FM sidebands on an RF
spectrum analyzer.  And the sidebands would also show up on the
interferometer.
<p>
There are two sources of periodic modulation of the optical frequency in the
SP-117 and SP-117A:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>HeNe laser power supply:</b>  The switchmode power supplies used
 in these lasers should be low ripple units, but if a power supply went
 bad, the replacement might not be.  One type of original power supply
 appears to be the Laser Drive model 111-1600-4.5-TTL-1.  (I'm not absolutely
 sure that this is either an original, or low ripple supply, but it was
 found in an apparently unmodified SP-117A controller.)
 The symptom of excessive ripple would be a 20 kHz to 50 kHz
 variation in the optical frequency with a deviation on the order of up to
 a few MHz.  The output of the HeNe laser power supply can also be tested
 electronically by measuring the AC component of the laser tube current.
 The typical ripple for a normal (non-low ripple) supply would be 1 to 3
 percent peak-to-peak (p-p).  For the SP-117/A, the normal tube current is
 4.5 mA, so the ripple would be 45 to 90 uA p-p.  A low ripple supply
 would have specs 1/10th or lower than this.
<p>
 An external ripple reducer circuit can be added to the output of the
 HeNe laser power supply.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdrrn">Reducing the Ripple and Noise in a HeNe Laser
 Power Supply</A>.
<p>
<li><b>Heater drive Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):</b> The current to the
 heater that controls the laser tube cavity length is provided by a PWM
 scheme that runs at about 5 kHz.  This was apparently done to reduce
 power dissipation in the electronics, but seems silly in a stabilized
 laser!  The exact mechanism by which the 5 kHz makes it into FM of the optical
 frequency is not known.  It could be mechanical or electromagnetic via
 the heater wrapped around the tube.
<p>
 <A HREF="117lhdm1.gif">SP-117A Stabilized HeNe Laser Linear Heater Drive
 Modification</A> shows a simple circuit that should eliminate this source
 of FM.  It consists of an RC filter (including the 15K ohm resistor that
 that feeds Q1) to convert the PWM to a linear drive signal.  The same
 fancy transistor can be used by removing it from the controller PCB and
 remounting it on an <i>isolated</i> heat-sink.  The gain pot is set so
 that the sensitivity is about the same as with the PWM signal.

<h2>Optodyne Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.optodyne.com/">Optodyne</A> is another manufacturer of
metrology systems based on HeNe lasers.  Their LDS-1000
among others uses the L-109 laser head along with a separate processor
box or PC card.  Like the original HP-5500C as well as the HP-5518A/B,
and HP-5519, the L-109 laser head
includes not only the laser, but also the optical receiver.  So, the
setup for each measurement axis consists of a laser head and either
a retroreflector (cube-corner) or simply a plane mirror.  The entire
configuration is essentially a Michelson interferometer, but most of
it is internal to the laser head.  So alignment during installation
on the machine or whatever is minimal and non-critical.  Though multiple
axes do require multiple lasers and their associated retroreflector
or mirror, this may end up being cheaper than the HP/Agilent and Zygo
systems that use a single very expensive laser, with`separate precise
beamsplitters and multiple sets of interferometer optics and optical
receivers, as the parts cost (at least!) for the laser head is probably
quote low.

<h3><A NAME="hstod1h">Optodyne L-109R Stabilized HeNe Laser Head</A></h3>

The HeNe laser uses a 6" Siemens barcode scanner-style tube with anode-end
output.  It may be a standard tube but the label, if any, is mostly hidden.
The laser is amplitude stabilized (only a single photodiode behind a
polarizer) using thermal control of cavity length.  The heater for
stabilization is a pair of LM395T power transistors attached to a metal
shroud surrounding the tube.  This is rather clever since virtually no
power is then wasted in a separate pass transistor or current limiting
resistor.  The controller has an SMT LM358, SMT 14066B, SMT ADP3367,
through-hole LM10C, and a pile of discrete components (most mounted
vertically to save space).  What's visible seems barely enough to
do the job, so there may be more parts hidden under the PCB.
<p>
As noted, the L-109 does NOT employ a two frequency technique with orthogonal
polarization and external interferometer optics as in the Zygo or
HP/Agilent lasers.  Rather a Bragg cell (basically an Acousto Optic
Modulator or AOM) adds a fixed
frequency offset to the return beam from the remote target which adds
to the Doppler shift due to target motion.  The two beams are then
heterodyned by the built in optical receiver shielded with copper foil that
feeds the processor.  It must get its power via the coax since there are
no other connections.  Either that, or it's simply a photodiode. The signal
out of the optical receiver is equivalent to MEAS in the HP/Agilent lasers.
Because the Bragg cell introduces a frequency shift for both the outgoing
and return beams that add, REF is double the frequency of the RF signal used
to drive the Bragg cell.  One interesting twist is that the output mirror
of the HeNe laser tube is also one mirror of the Michelson interferometer
so that wavefront alignment of the outgoing and return beams is assured as long
as the two beams are coincident on the photodiode of the optical
receiver.  The residual beam entering the laser tube through the
mirror does not destabilize the laser because it has been shifted
in optical frequency by the Bragg cell.  In principle, the resolution
and accuracy of this approach should be similar to that of the
orthogonally polarized two-frequency lasers with external interferometer
optics.
<p>
The most detailed explanation of how this all works seems to be in
U.S. Patent #5,116,126: Interferometer requiring no critical component
alignment.  What's on the Optodyne Web site itself is rather sparse.
However, some information is available on the "Downloads" page.
<p>
The laser head is much smaller than it appears on the Optodyne Web site,
only about 2x2x9 inches.  The "R" seems to refer to the normal 9 or 10 mm
beam diameter.  There is also an L-109N with a 0.5 mm beam and normal
1.7 mR beam divergence with no beam expander!  And, there is a 20 mm
version, probably with an external beam expander (or additional beam
expander).
<p>
The DC power input is 15 VDC based on measurements of a P-108L controller,
though the laser seems to be happy on as low as 10 VDC.  Older versions of
the L-109 laser head have a funky round LEMO-style connector with
3 mini-coaxes (1 of these appears to be unused) and 2 small female
pins for power.  The L-109 photos on the Optodyne Web site seem to
have separate connectors for the two signals (RF and MEAS) and power.
<p>
Here are some photos:

 connectors. :)

 It's difficult to see, but beyond the Bragg cell is the black angled
 mount for a pair of 45-degree beamsplitter mirrors.  One reflects
 a portion of the beam from the laser directly to the photodiode used
 for laser stablization.  The other reflects the return beam from the
 remote target to the output mirror of the laser tube, from where it
 bounces back to the optical receiver.  A portion of the beam from
 the laser tube goes straight through the mirrors to the optical
 receiver to heterodyne with it.
<p>
<li><A HREF="odl109t.jpg">Optodyne L-109R HeNe Laser Head - Closeup of
 Interferometer Optics</A>.  The output beam from the HeNe laser tube
 goes to the left with part of it reflecting off of the 45 degree
 beamsplitter mirror glued to the right of the black triangular mount
 to the photodiode at the top used for the laser stabilization.  A
 pair of polarizer sheets can be seen mounted between the mirror
 and photodiode.  (I'm actually not positive they are both polarizers;
 one may be a neutral density filter as two polarizers don't make sense!)
 The remainder of the beam is split into two parts by the 45 degree
 beamsplitter mirror
 glued to the left side of the black triangular mount.  This is the
 first mirror of the Michelson Interferometer.  The transmitted beam
 hits the optical receiver's photodiode in the silver can.  The
 reflected beam heads down to a 45 degree turning mirror just barely
 visible beneath the screw at the bottom, and then passes through the
 Bragg cell (hidden under the aluminum bracket with the coax clamp) and
 then heads to the beam expander at the far right (off the edge of the
 photo).  The return beam retraces these steps back to the beamsplitter
 where it reflects to the <i>right</i>, passes through the first
 beamsplitter which has not effect except to slightly reduce the
 intensity, then hits the output mirror of the HeNe laser tube and
 reflects back through the first beamsplitter mirror again, and then
 passes through the second beamsplitter mirror to the optical receiver's
 photodiode.
<p>
<li><A HREF="odl109e.jpg">Optodyne L-109R HeNe Laser Head - Closeup of
 Stabilization Electronics</A>.  The IC with illegible markings is an
 LM358D dual op-amp.  The 14066B is a quad bilateral (CMOS) switch and
 the LM10C is an op-amp with voltage reference.  Hidden beneath the clump
 of wires in the lower left corner is an ADP3367 +5 V regulator.   Note how
 most of the  discrete components are standing up!  And it's also possible
 (though unlikely) that there are additional parts mounted under the PCB.
 Both of these issues would make reverse engineering a real pain in the
 you-know-what, so don't even think about asking! :)
</ul>
<p>
The first L-109R that I acquired behaved rather strangely.  I was only powering
the laser and its stabilization electronics as I did not have an RF source
for the Bragg cell or processor to do anything with the MEAS signal, but
I don't think that is the problem.  It did lock to a single mode after
10 or 15 minutes.  However, after that there is a 2 or 3 minute cycle whereby
lock point slowly drifts part way over the gain curve, sits there for 10 or
20 seconds, at which point the green LED on the back of the laser head
gradually increases in brightness.  Then it moves back the way it came much
more quickly and abruptly re-locks at a different location on the gain
curve at which point the LED goes out, and the cycle repeats.  It's
almost certain that it remains locked during the slow drift,
just that the lock point is moving for some unknown reason, possibly
a fault in the electronics.  This can't be normal behavior, though the
limited optical frequency/wavelength variation may not materially
affect the measurement performance.  
<p>
But a second L-109R run from a P-108L controller (described below)
locked to a stable constant mode position after about 15 minutes,
though it did go through several false starts similar in behavior
to the first laser head.  I retested the first laser on the P-108L
with no obvious change, so there would seem to be a real problem.
<p>
The output of the first laser when locked (or what passes for being locked!)
is about 250 &micro;W, which is probably normal as at least one half
the power from the tube is lost in the beamsplitter optics forming
the internal part of the Michelson interferometer.  For testing without
RF drive to the Bragg cell, I adjusted the alignment of the beam expander
to output the <i>un-deflected beam</i>.  Otherwise, there is very little
output power, just a couple of splotches totally perhaps 40 &micro;W!  So,
depending on the efficiency of the Bragg cell, the locked output
could be lower than the 250 &micro;W I measured as it will depend
on what portion of the beam is actually deflected.  When I tested the first
L-109R laser head, I thought it was broken.  But after reading the
patent, have concluded that this is normal without any RF drive.
I do not believe that the altered alignment is the cause of the peculiar
behavior as I tested to confirm that back-reflections weren't confusing
stabilization by blocking the outgoing beam and monitoring the mode
sweep from the waste beam out the other end of the laser tube.  There
was no change.  One interesting tid-bit though: This tube is a flipper
for the first 5 minutes or so as it warms up, and then reverts to
normal behavior.
<p>
There's one other mystery associated with the first L-109R: A skinny
blue wire (like wire-wrap wire) is connected to the electronics PCB
and runs the length of the laser but is not attached to anything
at the other end.  All the other wires are fatter.  This sort of
thin wire is only used elsewhere in the laser head to as cable ties.
These can be seen in
<A HREF="odl109t.jpg">Optodyne L-109R HeNe Laser Head - Closeup of
Interferometer Optics</A>.  The unconnected wire runs
along the top of the photo and then curves down on the left.  Cable
ties using similar red and blue wires are also visible in the
upper center and surrounding the ballast case at the upper right.
It's not a ground wire as there's 1K ohms or more between
it and ground, and it doesn't appear to have
a counterpart in the second L-109R laser head, though I have not
removed the chassis from the case to examine its entire length.  At
first I thought the wire had ripped out of someplace when I pulled
off the rear cover, but I don't see any evidence of that.  It looks
like it was cut clean.  Of course if it was supposed to go somewhere,
that could explain the peculiar locking behavior. :)

<h3><A NAME="hstod1p">Optodyne P-108L Power Supply/Controller</A></h3>

The P-108L controller that went with these L-109R laser heads
generates quadrature outputs for position changes.  It isn't really that
old - the PCB artwork has a 1998 date code, though the circuitry is mostly
discrete logic, LS TTL and CMOS.  The IC date codes are from 1990 or 1991,
so it may have been a "last time buy" or manufactured as a replacement that had
to be compatible in every respect with some older equipment.  Although
there is a cutout (but no connector) for RS-232 in the case sheet metal,
there is no evidence of any PCB components - or even empty positions for
components or space for a mezzanine board - that would support it or a
microcontroller.  The RF drive for the Bragg cell is generated by a
separately metal-enclosed module and it approximately 60.0000 MHz
as measured with a frequency counter. :)  Internal power is +/-15 VDC
and +5 VDC from switchmode power supplies that take up over half the
space in the box.  More details may have to wait until I find or
build an umbilical cable as jumper-wiring it to the laser head
could be tricky.

<h2>Optra Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.optra.com/">Optra, Inc.</A> is another manufacturer of
equipment for (among other things) applications in precision motion
control.  At some time in the past, they offered two-frequency
HeNe lasers based on Zeeman splitting (and other products which based on
them), but apparently these have been discontinued in favor of high resolution
encoder-based techniques.
<p>
The Optra two-frequency HeNe lasers are not particularly unusual except for
their stabilization technique, which uses a heater wound around the
restricted portion of one mirror mount stem to control cavity length by
changing the length of the mirror mount itself, rather than of the entire
tube.  The only technical references I could locate were two Optra patents:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>U.S. Patent #4,823,348: Laser Stabilization Device.</b>  This
 covers the basic approach which includes controlling the mirror mount
 temperature.  Unlike the Aerotech Syncrolase 100 which uses
 induction heating of the mirror mount, the Optra design uses simple
 resistance heating.  The patent goes further and suggests that
 the magnetic field produced by the heater coil can also be used to
 produce small but very fast changes in wavelength as a result of its
 effect on the index of refraction of the ionized gas, though it's not
 clear if this was ever actually used in practice.
<p>
<li><b>U.S. Patent #4,672,618: Laser Stabilization Servo System.</b>
 The PLL-based locking scheme is the subject of this patent.  This
 patent may actually infringe on the Laboratory For Science patent
 (#4,468,773) for a very similar technique used in their model 220 laser.
 See the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstlfs">Laboratory
 for Science Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A>.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="hstop1">Optra Optralite Two-Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The Optra Optralite is an axial Zeeman HeNe laser similar in its principles of
operation to those of the HP/Agilent.  However, its REF (split)
frequency is only 250 kHz (as opposed to 1.5 MHz or higher for the
HP/Agilent lasers).  A conventional HeNe laser tube is used
with heaters on both the OC mirror mount stem and glass part of
the tube for cavity length control.  The magnet for the Zeeman splitting
is relatively low strength and small.  Feedback uses a Phase-Locked Loop
(PLL) to lock the REF (split) frequency to an internal crystal oscillator.
This laser includes an optical receiver for the return beam so it is
functionally similar to a laser like the Agilent 5519A (though many of its
performance specifications differ greatly).
<p>
Due to the low split frequency, long conventional tube, whimpy magnet, and PLL
locking technique, I originally thought that the Optralite was a transverse
Zeeman HeNe laser.  Transverse Zeeman HeNe lasers normally have split
frequencies in the hundreds of kHz range, not the MHz range as with most
other axial Zeeman HeNe lasers.  However, after finding the raw output from
the HeNe laser tube to be circularly polarized and not linearly polarized,
I checked the magnetic field orientation more carefully with my trusty
cereal box compass and found it to be pointing along the axis of the
tube, and uniform around the perimeter of the ring magnets - the definition
of an axial magnetic field!  That they are ring magnets and not bar magnets
on either side of the tube should have been the tip-off, but I guess I
wasn't paying attention!  The tube in an axial Zeeman HeNe laser produces
a pair of left and right circularly polarized components while the tube in a
transverse Zeeman HeNe laser produces a pair of orthogonal linearly polarized
components.
<p>
However, given the very limited coverage of the magnetic field of perhaps
25 percent of the gain region (the bore discharge) - and probably not
being particularly uniform as well - it's not clear how the neon gain curve
will be split and what will happen when more than one longitudinal mode is
lasing.  In addition, the near-hemispherical cavity this tube likely has
will result in a tapered intra-cavity mode volume with a corresponding
variation in gain.  This seems to be leading up to a messy integral better
left for the advanced course. :)  But ignoring the mode volume issue and
simplifying the situation to two parts:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Constant magnetic field over 25 percent of gain region.  Neon gain curve
 is split and each part shifted, say, 100 MHz.  Contribution of each part is
 12.5 percent.
<p>
<li>No magnetic field over 75 percent of gain region.  Neon gain curve is
 not split, but can be modeled as split with a 0 MHz shift.  Contribution
 of each part is 37.5 percent.
</ul>
<p>
These two pairs of functions could be summed resulting in a combined
Zeeman-split neon gain curve.  Each portion would look like a lop-sided
Gaussian weighted a bit away from the center.  (The gain curve diagrams
shown in the patent do not represent reality.)
<p>
The Optralite uses a 7-1/8 inch (181 mm) random polarized Aerotech HeNe laser
tube of conventional design, but with an additional optic glued to the HR
mirror, possibly to add wedge and/or an AR-coating to minimize back-reflections
and etalon effects.  Whether it is specially modified in any other way is
not known but all indications are that it is a standard model.  And
according to the second patent, above, the tube may be an Aerotech LT05R
which uses natural Ne but isotopically pure <sup>3</sup>He.
The tube used in the Aerotech Syncrolase 100 is physically identical -
perhaps this is more than a coincidence.
A tube of this length would almost certainly result in the production of
rogue modes if mated with the type of strong full length magnet found in the
HP/Agilent lasers.  Normally, when the laser is locked, there should be a
single Zeeman-split lasing mode consisting of the two frequency components
F1 and F2.  Rogue modes are undesirable lasing modes that are present due
to additional longitudinal modes fitting under the Zeeman-split neon gain
curve.  The tubes in HP/Agilent lasers have a cavity length of only
around 5 inches (127 mm) to suppress rogue modes, and axial Zeeman HeNe lasers
from other manufacturers use tubes with shorter cavities - some are 4 inches
(102 mm) or even less.  But with the Optralite, this relatively long HeNe
laser tube, which has a cavity length of around 6-3/4 inches (172 mm), can
be used without the risk of producing rogue modes because the two parts of
the Zeeman-split neon gain curve are not spread very far apart by the small
low strength magnet.
<p>
As with the HP/Agilent lasers, a quarter waveplate at the output is used
to convert the circular polarization to linear polarization, with the same
adjustments - rotation and tilt.  But the mount is a real pain to deal with
as the waveplate itself is glued to the hub of a spherical bearing that can
rotate around its axis in an outer shell.  This entire affair is simply
clamped via a set-screw so it's almost impossible to independently adjust
rotation and tilt.  However, there are a pair of holes on the front side of
the inner hub so it may be possible to make a special tool (like a bent
paper clip!) for this purpose.  Perhaps that's what they used at Optra. :)
There is no half waveplate like the one present in *all* HP/Agilent
lasers.  It's possible that since the laser tube can be optimally oriented
in its mount during final assembly and alignment, the half waveplate
may be unnecessary.  (This is not possible with HP/Agilent lasers since
their tubes are embedded in potting compound.)
<p>
Feedback is provided by a single photodiode behind a polarizer which monitors
the waste beam from the rear of the tube.  A CD4046-based PLL locks the Zeeman
beat to a reference oscillator using thermal control of the cavity length
of the HeNe laser tube.  While a PLL can be used with any laser where beat
frequencies are present and correlate with lasing mode position,
the only other Zeeman HeNe laser I'd seen that used a PLL was the Laboratory
For Science model 220, a transverse Zeeman laser which also used a CD4046.
(The LFS-260 had a PLL for stabilization as well, but it is not a Zeeman
laser.)
<p>
There are two heaters for cavity length control.  One covers a bit
over an inch of the length of the tube near its center to maintain the
overall temperature of the tube - DC and low frequency response.  The
other is wrapped around the OC mirror mount stem to provide high
frequency (well relatively speaking!) response.  The tube heater is a
bit strange, at least compared to those on every other stabilized
laser I've seen.  It's not a low voltage thin film Kapton heater, but
is covered with some sort of high temperature fabric, has a resistance
of around 1K ohms, and is powered from 115 VAC via a DC-controlled solid state
relay!  During warmup, it is run at full voltage but once the system
locks, it seems to be driven by a bang-bang-bang control loop with
only three states - off, 1/2 voltage, and full voltage, swinging
wildly between these even when the laser is locked and stable, and
more so if the optical feedback or thermal environment is disturbed.
(However, I do not really know if this is how it is supposed to work and
the 1/2 voltage state may just be an illusion due to very rapid
switching.)  At the same time, the mirror mount stem heater has a nearly
constant voltage of approximately 7.5 VDC on it when the laser is locked
and stable, but which varies in a more continuous manner if the optical
feedback or thermal environment is disturbed.  The actual drive to the mirror
mount stem heater is a filtered version of a PWFM (Pulse Width Frequency
Modulation) signal - a pulse train that varies in frequency from about
50 Hz to several kHz and whose duty cycle also changes.  Its derived
from the PLL somehow but is clearly not directly out of the CD4046.
A TIP121 Darlington power transistor configured as an emitter-follower
provides up to approximately 10 V to the heater.
<p>
Interrupting the beam to the feedback photodiode will result in wild
swings of both heater voltages and if done repeatedly, will eventually cause
the system to lose lock and return to the warmup state for a few minutes before
re-acquiring lock.  Touching the tube (which affects its temperature)
or blowing on it will produce a somewhat more muted response.
<p>
The Zeeman magnetic field is produced by a pair of permanent (ferrite) ring
magnets each about 1/4 inch thick and not quite touching, attached
to the tube and frame with globs of RTV Silicone.  They are approximately
centered on the discharge of the tube (the bore), although they only actually
overlap perhaps 20 percent of it.  The field strength is probably a few
hundred gauss.
<p>
Several photos of the Optra Optralite laser can be found in the

 +/-15 VDC for the analog circuitry.  The orange braided affair is the cover
 over the tube heater.  The mirror mount stem heater cover can be seen at the
 right-end of the tube.  The Zeeman ring magnets are just barely visible near
 the center under the curved shield.

 Other ICs include op-amps (LM324, TL072), a 555 timer, logic (CD4001,
 CD4013), and voltage comparators (LM339).  Can you locate any trmpots?
 I bet not. :)
</ul>
<p>
The Optralite I have is in good physical condition and seems to operate
normally - at times (more below).  It locks in about 9 minutes from a cold
start, with an output power of about 1.35 mW.  Although this may be a bit
low for a typical 7 inch HeNe laser tube when new, it is above the CDRH
sticker rating of 1 mW!
<p>
There are a pair of BNC connectors on the rear panel (see photo, above).
The one on the left is for the internally generated REF signal
and the one on the right is for the output of the optical receiver which
Optra calls SIGNAL (but HP/Agilent calls MEAS).  Both outputs are simply
amplified from their respective photodiodes with no clipping or conversion
to digital signals.  So, the amplitude of REF depends on the output power
of the laser tube and the amplitude of SIGNAL depends on the strength and
alignment of the return beam.
<p>
From a cold start at around 65 &deg;F (18.3 &deg;C), the laser goes through
around 196 complete mode sweep cycles and then a partial one as the PLL kicks
in after about 9 minutes.  The first cycle takes about 1 second and the last
about 8 seconds.  However, each cycle represents a change in cavity length
of only 1/2 wavelength rather than the full wavelength of a laser with
orthogonal linearly polarized modes, so it's equivalent to 98 of those.
But this still seems a bit high.
<p>
Interestingly, there is less than a 20 percent variation in the
output power of F1 or F2 during mode sweep.  This must mean that there are
multiple longitudinal modes present throughout almost its entire range.
Although the tube is long by axial Zeeman laser standards, it's short enough
that under normal conditions with no magnetic field, the mode sweep would be
very large, possibly even 100 percent.
<p>
At the same time, REF exhibits a wide frequency variation from below
60 kHz to over 310 kHz due to mode sweep.  Over most of this range, REF
is a nice sinusoid.  But near the minimum frequency, the waveform becomes
quite distorted, though the beat never disappears entirely as it does over
much of the mode sweep in HP/Agilent lasers.  The lock point is at
250 kHz - just below the peak.  And the PLL maintains REF at precisely
250.000 kHz +/-0.5 Hz averaged over 1 second.
<p>
However, there is definitely a problem with this laser.  Although it sometimes
remains perfectly stable for several hours with the cover removed, it lost
lock after a short while when restarted with the cover installed, seemingly
unable to increase the tube temperature even when RESET.  That 8 second mode
sweep cycle just before lock already means that the tube
is nearly as hot as it can get since the heater has been running at full
power.  Assuming that some sort of timing criteria is used to determine
when to lock (as there doesn't appear to be any temperature sensor for the
tube), perhaps the heater is not supposed to be running at full power
during warmup or it should be locking earlier when the mode sweep cycle is
much shorter than 8 seconds.
<p>
In addition, if disturbed in any way (or perhaps even if not), that remarkable
stability is lost as though there is something trying to push it up by a few
kHz.  REF would go down to 250.000 kHz, then after a few seconds start
creeping up until it gets forced back down to 250.000 kHz, and the cycle
repeats.  It might go up to 255 kHz or higher, or only to 250.1 kHz
depending on how it feels.  However, given that it is possible under
some undefined conditions to maintain 250.000 kHz continuously apparently
forever, this suggests some sort of intermittent problem in the electronics.
Perhaps an op-amp is latching up.  But it could even be noisy power.
Or, maybe that spastic drive to the tube heater should really vary
more continuously.  A schematic would be *really* helpful about now. :-)
<p>
The maximum beat frequency during mode sweep would actually correspond
to the condition where the optical frequency is centered on the Zeeman-spilt
neon gain curve and be the most stable in terms of absolute optical freqency
over the long term.  So, since the laser locks at 250 kHz which is offset by
about 60 kHz suggests that as the tube ages and its power declines, there
will be some additional drift in optical frequency, not present with the
HP/Agilent lasers that automatically keep the lock point centered.
<p>
Since the range of beat frequencies during mode sweep is rather wide, it
might be possible to change the strapping of the SPG8640BN to 200 kHz,
166.67 kHz, or perhaps even 100 kHz if a different REF frequency were desired
for some unfathomable reason.  Hey, another programmable two-frequency
laser! :)  (The LFS-220 PLL has BCD switches for this purpose, but with
enough resolution to actually select the optical frequency to a very
high precision.)
<p>
As expected, the output from the laser consists of two linearly polarized
components, F1 and F2, separated from each-other by the split frequency,
and orthogonal to each-other lined up with the laser's
X and Y axes.  Thus, as with other similar lasers, the beat signal amplitude
with an external photodiode is a maximum with a polarizer oriented at 45
degrees.  The optical power of F1 and F2 is nearly equal when the laser is
locked, but there is relatively little variation even during mode sweep.  It
is not yet known whether F1 (the lower frequency component) is horizontally
or vertically oriented.  There is a shutter with positions for "OPEN/NORMAL"
(with polarizer at 45 degrees in front of optical receiver photodiode),
"CLOSED" (output beam is blocked), and "OPEN/FDL" (with no polarizer
in front of optical receiver photodiode - no idea what "FDL" means).
<p>
The green "LOCKED" LED comes on once the laser has locked (about 10 minutes
from a cold start, possibly once a complete mode sweep cycle exceeds about
8 seconds).  It is apparently monitoring the PWFM drive to the mirror
mount stem heater as it is a pulse train with a 70 or 80 percent duty cycle
and also flickers with back-reflections or when the laser is disturbed in
another way such as by blowing on the tube.  Pressing the "RESET" button
while locked causes the laser to go through a few minutes of behavior similar
to the mode sweep during warmup, at which point it then snaps back into lock.
I'm not sure under what specific conditions the red "UNLOCKED" LED is supposed
to come on.  I forced it to light up momentarily by blowing on the tube
so lock was lost and then reacquired.  It is not on during warmup or RESET.
(Originally, UNLOCKED never came on under any conditions, which seemed
suspicious.  It turned out that the LED was dead.  Surely the laser hadn't
been unlocked for long enough to wear out an LED!)
<p>
Only pins 1 to 9 of the "REMOTE" connector are wired to anything.  Here are
their functions:

</PRE>
<p>
Pins 10 to 15 are not connected to anything.
<p>
The laser may be RESET by pulling down on pin 5.  While there are
three signals relevant to the mirror mount stem heater (pins 3, 4, and 6),
the tube heater doesn't seem to be represented at all.
Surprisingly, digital status information - like whether the laser is locked -
is not present on this connector, at least not in a simple 0 or 1 form.
But it can be inferred from the PWFM and heater drive signals.
<p>
This laser has no electronic adjustments of any kind as there are
exactly *zero* trimpots on the control PCB.  But perhaps some of the
component values are hand-selected at the time of manufacture based on
the measured output power of the HeNe laser tube and other characteristics
once the tube assembly with the Zeeman magnet has been installed.  On the
other hand as long as the range of beat frequencies during the mode sweep
includes 250 kHz regardless what happens as the tube ages and the feedback
can handle the normal decline in waste beam output power, there really
shouldn't be any need for adjustments!

<h2>Spectra-Physics Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hstsp117a">SP-117 and SP-117A Stabilized Single Frequency HeNe Lasers</A></h3>

The SP-117A is a stabilized HeNe laser which produces a single
longitudinal mode output with a nominal frequency of 473.61254 THz
and may be either stabilized in frequency or stabilized in amplitude.
The earlier SP-117 lacks the amplitude stabilization function but is
otherwise functionally similar.  The output is normally a linearly
polarized single mode (this is what is spec'd for the laser) or a
pair of orthogonally polarized modes (if the output polarizer is removed).
<p>
This system had a sticker price of just under $5,000 but since around the time
of the acquisition of Spectra-Physics by Newport, is no longer in production.
It consists of a cylindrical laser head and power supply/controller.
Go to <A HREF="http://www.newport.com/">Spectra-Physics/Newport</A> and
search for "117A".
<p>
The 05-STP-901 from Melles Griot appears to be the same system as the
SP-117A except for the front panel decor and color scheme as it has the
same specifications, controls, indicators, and connectors - including
the strange three-pin Spectra-Physics HV connector not found on any
other Melles Griot lasers.  In fact, the PCB inside the 05-STP-901 case
has the Spectra-Physics logo on it and "Fab" and "Assy" numbers
that begin with "117"!  As if this is not enough, the 640 MHz mode
spacing of the 05-STP-901 listed in the Melles Griot catalog is the
same as the Spectra-Physics 088-2 HeNe laser tube used in the SP-117.
And, Melles Griot *does* have an 05-LHR-088 tube which matches the 088
physically and has a mode spacing of 641 MHz.  Coincidence?  I don't think
so. :)  (However, inquiries to Melles Griot have not indicated any
acknowledgement of this, nor the option to actually buy such a tube without
the attached laser.)  Thus, a new SP-117A would probably have a Melles Griot
tube inside since Spectra-Physics has been out of the HeNe laser tube business
for some time.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstmgst">Melles Griot
Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A>.  However, at least some of these tubes have
an AR coating on the HR mirror (likely in addition to being wedged) as well
as on the OC mirror.  The purpose would be to futher minimize backreflections
and to get the most power from the waste beam since that's used for the
mode sampling photodiode pickup.  The minimization of backreflections is by
far the most important for two reasons:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Minimize coherent light that goes back into the laser cavity.  This can
 both destabilize the lasing process increasing noise, and possibly result
 in mode flipping.
<p>
<li>Suppress any etalon effect created by the two surfaces of the HR optic.
 The mirror coating along with a parallel bare glass surface could result in
 more than a 2X fluctuation in waste beam power (the envelope of the mode
 sweep) and up to a few percent fluctuation in main beam power as a
 function of temperature simply due to the change in the effective reflectance
 of the HR mirror.  The stabilization uses the waste beam for feedback
 control and depends on its power being related to the main beam power by a
 fixed ratio (order of 1:200).  An etalon effect would result in fluctuations
 in this ratio and thus in both frequency and intensity of the output.
</ol>
<p>
So, the existence of an AR coating on the HR is one way
of determining that the tube you have is from or for a SP-117/A or
05-STP-901 stabilized laser, rather than a barcode scanner.  Common
non-stabilized HeNe lasers - even very expensive ones - do not have this.
And, I've even seen what I believe to be standard Uniphase 098 tubes (no
AR coating) in these lasers.  Go figure. :)
<p>
A search of the Spectra-Physics Web site used to return a link to a model 117
with some confusing text about the model 117, 117A, and 117B, but that 117
isn't the same as the original SP-117 or SP-117A described below, and the page
seems to have disappeared.  It even mentioned Brewster windows but none of
these lasers ever had Brewster windows!  The SP-117B was probably
an OEM version of the SP-117A, possibly superseeded by the SP-117C,
covered later.  There may also have been an SP-117D, similar to the
SP-117/A, also for OEM applications.
<p>
The following description applies to both the SP-117 and SP-117A (and
MG 05-STP-901) unless otherwise noted.  The laser head I dissected was
an SP-117, though I expect the newer ones to be very similar.
A typical SP-117 is shown in <A HREF="sp117s1.jpg">Spectra-Physics
Model 117 Stabilized HeNe Laser System</A>.  The SP-117A is in an similar
package with the Frequency/Intensity mode keylock switch and Locked LED
added.  The PCB is a completely new layout to accomodate the added circuitry
for Intensity mode but everything else is similar.  Why change a good thing?
<p>
The HeNe laser head is powered from a HeNe laser power supply brick
(approximately 1,700 V at 4.5 mA) via the usual strange Spectra-Physics
screw-lock HV connector, with a separate cable with a DB9 connector for the
photodiode signals and heater power.  The only thing non-standard about the
brick may be a lower p-p ripple and noise specification but there is no
special external regulation of this power supply.  However, for it to turn
on requires that the interlock plug be present on the back of the controller,
that the microswitch inside the HV connector be depressed by a plastic pin
in the HV plug, and that pins 2 and 7 on the signal connector be
jumpered.
<p>
The cylindrical laser head contains the tube, output optics, and beam sampling
assembly.  A view of the parts after disassembly is shown in
<A HREF="sp117h1.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model 117 Stabilized HeNe Laser Head
Components</A>.  Sampling is from the waste beam at the HR-end - simply a
polarizing beamsplitter (inside the black cylinder, upper left) feeding a
pair of solar cells/photodiodes (glued to the metal bracket attached to it).
Since this is at the HR-end of the tube, it doesn't reduce the output power.
The entire guts can be pulled out by loosening a bunch of setscrews.
Disassembly to the state of affairs in the photo took about 10 minutes, all
completely reversible except for cutting small blobs of black RTV silicone
holding the laser tube in place in the cut out aluminum cylinder at the
top of the photo..
<p>
The HeNe laser tube itself looks like it is some version of a
Spectra-Physics model 88 - the same type that used to be found in
barcode scanners.  However, note that the version used in the
SP-117/A has cathode-end output, unlike the anode-end output of
the barcode scanner tube.  A sample I have produces over 3 mW, so
it's probably a higher power version, perhaps an 088-2.  As noted,
those of more recent manufacture may use the Melles Griot 05-LHR-088.
I have no idea if the tube is special in any other way, like having
been selected for no more than two longitudinal modes or filled with
isotopically pure gases or blessed by the Laser Gods. :) There were
no markings of any kind on this one and at this point, I rather
think that the only special requirement is that the tube not be a
"flipper" - one where the polarization state of the modes switches
abruptly rather than remaining fixed.  In fact, I rebuilt an SP-117
laser head with a surplus 088-2 tube and it would seem to work fine.
See the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrsp117s">Transplant Surgery
for Two Sick Spectra-Physics Model 117 Stabilized HeNe Laser Heads</A>.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube has the multiple layer aluminum
foil covering Spectra-Physics is so fond of.  There may even be more
layers than normal, covering a larger portion of the tube than normal.
A thin film heater (copper-colored cylinder) is wrapped much of the way
around the tube on top of the aluminum foil, and glued in place.
Finally, here is an application where the aluminum foil actually
might make sense to distribute the heat uniformly. :)  The short black
cylinder on the right holds a (PBS) Polarizing BeamSplitter (with the reflected
output blocked) to select one of the two orthogonally polarized modes of
the laser, possibly optional since it was not present on one of the SP-117
laser heads, or an SP-117A laser head that I've seen.  So, either, whoever
originally had these things salvaged the PBS as the only remaining useful
part before selling them, or that is an option not present on all units.
On the SP-117, it's a normal PBS cube mounted such that the laser guts
have to be slid out of the laser head cylinder to access the set-screw
holding it in place.  On the SP-117A, it's a PBS that has a rhombus
cross-section - a slightly distorted cube - presumably to minimize
backreflections.  And on the SP-117A, the PBS is secured by two screws
accessible from the front once the bezel is removed
<p>
Prior to assembly at the factory, the tube must be tested
to determine the best orientation for maximum signal change of the two
polarized modes since there is no adjustment for this once the tube is
mounted with RTV silicone.  The specific orientation is determined by
slight asymmetries in the tube construction - random factors like mirror
coatings and alignment - but should not change with age or use.
<p>
After an initial warmup period where the heater is run continuously,
the controller enables the feedback loop which monitors the two outputs of
the beam sampler and maintains cavity length using the heater typically
so that the two orthogonally polarized longitudinal modes are equidistant
on opposide sides of the neon gain curve (for best stability when running
frequency stabilized) or where one mode is closer to the center of the
gain curve (which may be desirable when running amplitude stabilized to
get a bit more output power in that mode).  Although I haven't
measured it, there are probably around 75 complete mode cycles before locking.
The switchover occurs when the period of a full mode sweep cycle exceeds
about 18 seconds.  (If rebuilding one of these lasers, that time may have
to be adjusted due to differences in the thermal characteristics of the
tube, and the thermal coupling and insulation of the heater.)
<p>
The user controls on the SP-117A consist of a switch for power and a switch
to select between frequency and amplitude stabilization.  There are
indicators for AC power and Stabilized.  (The SP-117 is physically
identical but lacks the mode select switch.)  After a warmup period of about
15 to 20 minutes for the laser head to reach operating temperature, the
Stabilized indicator will come on and may flash for a few seconds, and after
that should remain solidly on.  This really indicates only that the
stabilization feedback loop is active, NOT that the laser is actually
stabilized and meets specs - that may require another minute or so.
For the SP-117A and MG 05-STP-901, the behavior is similar in Frequency
or Intensity mode.  (The SP-117 has no Intensity mode.)  In fact, the way
they are designed, everything is identical in both modes until the Stabilized
indicator comes on, then it switches to the Intensity signal for locking.
If power is cycled, the delay to Stabilized is much shorter,
so no actual counter delay is involved, just some circuit watching for
the mode changes to slow down below that 18 second threshold.  Indeed,
if the photodiodes are disconnected, Stabilized will come on in under
a minute even though the modes are varying wildly.  Stupid electronics. :)
<p>
The internal circuitry of the controller box is relatively simple and includes
some CMOS logic including several monostables (!!) for timing the warmup
period, multiple op-amps and comparators, a 555 timer, voltage regulator,
and switching transistor for the heater - all standard stuff.
A linear power supply feeds the HeNe laser power supply and the control
electronics,

<p>
Although, it's very likely that any reasonably healthy SP-117/A laser head
will lock on any SP-117/A controller, adjusting the controller for optimal
mode signal swing will result in best stability and permit the location
of the two orthogonal modes on the neon gain curve to be fine tuned.

the newer SP-117A and the essentially identical Melles Griot 05-STP-901
controller.  (I actually did this from the 05-STP-901 PCB, but it
had SP markings!)  The only parts not included in the diagrams are the AC line
front-end and voltage selection circuitry. the internal 12 VDC linear
power supply, and the Laser Drive HeNe laser power supply.
<p>
Note that older versions of the SP-117A differ slightly in their
design.  The most obvious one being that they totally lack the two relays
found in the 05-STP-901 and appear similar to the SP-117 in other respects
like the use of the ICL7660 rather than 555 for generating the clock.
But I haven't examined one in enough detail to identify other differences.
<p>
There are three sheets:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="117apsch.pdf">Spectra-Physics 117A Power/Logic 1 Section</A>
 includes the +9 VDC regulator, -9 VDC inverter, reset/interlock logic, and
 PWM ramp generator.
<p>
<li><A HREF="117alsch.pdf">Spectra-Physics 117A Logic 2 Section</A>
 includes most of the remaining timing and logic circuitry.
<p>
<li><A HREF="117aasch.pdf">Spectra-Physics 117A Analog Section</A>
 includes the photodiode preamps, error amp, PID amp, frequency/intensity
 mode selection, and tuning input.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="hstsp117d">Differences Between the SP-117 and SP-117A Lasers</A></h4>

(All of the following also applies to the Melles Griot 05-STP-901, which is
essentially a rebadged SP-117A with a different case color and front panel
arrangement.  The PCB inside is labelled "117A".)
<p>
Some of the circuitry of the SP-117 and SP-117A is similar and the designer of
the SP-117A clearly had access to the SP-117 schematics.  However, substantial
portions have been totally redesigned rather than simply tacking on the
amplitude stabilization and modulation input as a minor addition.  The low
voltage power supply including the on-board regulation, the heater driver,
the HeNe laser power supply, and at least some of the logic/timing circuitry
are very similar.  But in the SP-117A, the negative voltage source is provided
by an a 555 rather than an ICL7660, different op-amps types are used in
the analog sections, and the basic design of the control loop has also
changed.  Of most significance in terms of performance, unlike in the SP-117A,
there appears to be no pure integrator stage in the analog chain of the
SP-117.  Note how much simpler the control loop (analog schematics pages)
is for the SP-117 compared to the SP-117A!  So there will always be an
offset due to the finite and relatively modest gain between the photodiodes
and heater response.  This means that the exact position of the locked
lasing line on the neon gain curve will have a dependency on ambient
temperature and initial conditions when the SP-117 is turned on or
restarted.  And, it will drift somewhat until
thermal equilibrium is achieved, which may take considerable time
after the Locked indicator comes on.  Exactly this behavior has been observed
with the SP-117 and wouldn't make sense had the design been similar to that
of the SP-117A with a full PID control loop.  These anomolies were bothering
me and in fact were the original reason I decided to trace the SP-117 circuit.
My confusion was your gain. :)

<h4><A NAME="hstsp117m">Longitudinal Modes of the SP-117/A Laser</A></h4>

I have looked at the longitudinal modes of an SP-117 laser head using my
home-built scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer.  (Since the SP-117A laser
head is virtually identical, I assume the mode behavior will be also.)
The head was powered by an SP-248 exciter so there was no mode stabilization.
As the tube heated and expanded, the modes would cycle under the gain curve
(normal behavior for any HeNe laser!).  It oscillates on at most two
modes with a tendency for there to be two modes of reasonably equal
amplitude.  A single mode appeared for a relatively small portion of
the cycle but I assume that might actually be the desired result when
using the feedback system.  (Probably for amplitude stabilization but
not frequency stabilation, where locking on the slope results in lower
uncertainty.) Having at most 2 modes is unusual for a
HeNe laser of this power as 3 or 4 modes would be expected based on
the tube length.  However, as noted above, the tube is similar to a
1 to 2 mW barcode scanner tube and thus quite short for the 3+ mW
output power.
<p>
This laser seems to be interesting in another respect:
While for the typical ordinary HeNe laser, the modes roughly
follow the profile of the gain curve as they traverse it, with this
tube, the mode on one side will tend to disappear and reappear on the
other side of the gain curve relatively abruptly.
I don't know whether this behavior is a peculiarity or a feature
but it seems like it could be beneficial. ;-)

<h3><A NAME="hstsp117c">Description of the SP-117C Stabilized Single Frequency
 HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The SP-117C is an OEM version of the SP-117A described in the previous
sections and is intended to be built into a piece of equipment like an
interferometer or wavemeter.  Therefore, most of the differences are in
the packaging and cost departments while the laser and electronics remain
very similar. However, some features like the tuning input are not
present (or at least not obvious).  Interlocks, protection from high
voltage, safety stichers, and other regulatory requirements are the
responsitibility of the OEM.  And, it's presently unknown if both
frequency and intensity stabilization modes are supported although
this would appear to be the case based on
the same three adjustment pots being present as only two are used for
frequency stabilization.  While nowhere to be found on the
Newport/Spectra-Physics Web site, I have been told that the SP-117C
is still in production.
<p>
The laser is a single unit mounted on a solid baseplate (with
exposed high voltage!).  It is designed to install in a cabinet painted
with the decorator colors of your choice. :)  See
<A HREF="sp117o1.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model 117 OEM Stabilized HeNe Laser
Assembly</A>.  On my sample, there was a separate box with a +/-12 VDC
switchmode power supply and lighted power switch as the only user control.
The SP-117C has no output polarizer so that must be supplied
by the user.  Its operational behavior is similar to
the other SP-117s, though the warmup is faster - under 10 minutes.
Locking is then abrupt with no overshoot or ringing.  Locking
following a power interruption of a few seconds occurs in under 1
minute.  When to switch from warmup to lock mode is probably detected
by a complete mode cycle taking more than around 15 seconds.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube looks like the same 088 used in the other systems.  It's
probably from Melles Griot by its relatively thin-walled construction.
The 12 VDC input HeNe laser power supply brick is hidden underneath.
The PCB generally resembles the one in the SP-117A and 05-STP-901
controllers with many of the same part numbers, though there
are also many differences and it has clearly been substantially
redesigned.  The timing is now done using 12 bit binary counters
instead of multiple monostables.  The majority of the discrete
resistors have been replaced with resistor packs.  There is also a
pair of resistor packs in sockets for reasons unknown.  The input
is +/-12 VDC (rather than just +12 VDC), supposedly being regulated to
+/-9 VDC on-board according to the test point labeling.  But the
resistor that sets the voltage on the sample I have has been selected
to produce +/-8 VDC instead of +/-9 VDC and that works
fine.  There is no 555 oscillator to generate the negative voltage of
the SP-117 and SP-117A controllers, so the associated PWM clock must be
produced in some other way.  There are pads for four large series
diodes with jumpers in their place.  These would be used to reduce the DC
voltage to the HeNe laser power supply if more than 12 VDC were used for the
positive power supply.  Small MOSFETs are used to control the
Enable line of the HeNe laser power supply and the Locked signal, as
well as some internal signals.  And, in case you're wondering, I
have absolutely no intention of reverse engineering this unit the
way I did the SP-117A!  But I have determined most of the external
connections to the 14 pin header visible in the upper left corner of
the above photo based on how it is wired and the obvious PCB traces:
<p>

</PRE>
<p>
Gary Turner says that Pin 6 is connected to a front panel "Reset" switch
on his controller.  The manual says that you can use the Reset to clear
a flashing "Lock" status, which can occur if there is a temperature/power
issue.
<p>
The Locked signal originates from an IRFD210 MOSFET which can sink 0.6 A,
more than enough current to drive an LED - or a bank of them. :)  The
+/-12 VDC for the unit I have comes from a small switchmode power supply
in a separate box.  The analog and digital positive voltages (+Va and +Vd)
are the same.  I added a Locked LED there and will install a switch if the
unidentified control signal does something useful.  I guess a reset function
could be useful, but then neither Gary or I have ever seen Lock flashing!
<p>
I am in need of a user manual for the SP-117C including info to confirm
what I have on the 14 pin header is correct and to determine the function
of the unidentified control signal.  (Grounding it either during operation
or prior to power-on has no obvious effect.)  If you have any info, please
contact me via the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ

<h3><A NAME="hstsp119">SP-119 Laser Head with SP-259 Exciter</A></h3>

The Spectra-Physics 119 is a really early - possibly the first - feedback
stabilized HeNe laser that was commercially available.  An old product
brochure with the SP-119 laser can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/brochures/">Vintage Lasers
and Accessories Brochures</A> under "Spectra-Physics", on the last page of
the "HeNe Gas Laser Catalog (1964)".  1964!!  That's only 4 years after
the laser was invented!
<p>
The spec'd output power for the original SP-119 is a whopping 70 microWatts
(&micro;W) at 632.8 nm, the normal red HeNe wavelength!  With only temperature
control, the frequency stability was spec'd to be +/-75 Mcps/day.  This is
before Hertz was used for cycles per second (cps)!.  With the optional Servo
Option 259-002 for active cavity length control using the Lamb dip for
stabilization (which is actually more sophisticated than modern
mode-stabilized HeNe lasers) it goes down to +/-5 Mcps/day.
<p>
And the price loaded for the 119 laser head and 259 exciter with the
259-002 Servo Option in 1964: $5,775.00.  That's about the same cost
as a his and hers set of Chevy Impalas. :)
<p>
The specifications for output power and stability were subsequently upgraded
to 100 &micro;W (WOW!) and +/-1 Mcps/day.  The latter IS impressive and
represents a stability of +/-2 parts-per-billion (ppb), which is better
than most modern stabilized HeNe lasers.
<p>
Here are the specifications for the SP-119 laser head with the SP-259B
exciter from the Spectra-Physics 119 Gas Laser Operator Manual.  I've
tried to use the original units and terminology:

<h4><A NAME="hstsp119l">SP-119 Laser Principles of Operation</a></h4>

The SP-119 laser system consists of the 119 laser head and
259 power supply/controller.  The basic system with the 259-001 plugin
has a well regulated HeNe laser power supply, a precision temperature
controller for the laser resonator, and an adjustable voltage driving
a PieZo Transducer (PZT) to vary cavity length for tuning of the
optical frequency.  With adequate warmup time - several hours - this alone
provides reasonable stability without (optical) feedback control.  The
259-002 Servo Option adds active stabilization using the Lamb dip
at the center of the neon gain curve of a HeNe laser when a specific
set of conditions are satisfied.  In principle, using the Lamb dip as
a reference can provide better long term stability than the more
common dual polarization and similar techniques because, among other
factors, it is insensitive to amplitude changes resulting from laser
tube aging.
<p>
The Lamb dip isn't something that goes with mint sauce or cheese and
crackers. :)  It is a depression at the center of the gain curve that may
occur under the proper conditions in a laser with an inhomogeneously broadened
gain medium and is the result of hole burning or depletion caused by the
lasing process in a standing wave cavity.  W. E. Lamb was an early laser
researcher who first predicted its existence in: "Theory of an
Optical Maser", Phys. Rev. 134, pp. 1429 (1964).  A. Szoke and A. Javan
described it in a more useful form in: "Isotope Shift and Saturation
Behavior of the 1.15-&micro; Transition of Neon", Phys. Rev. Lett.,
vol 10, issue 12, pp. 521-524, June 15, 1963.  (Letters are published much
more quickly than full papers which is why I assume this seems to
be acausal.)
<p>
In a HeNe laser, the Lamb dip is the result of hole burning or depletion in
the inhomogeneously Doppler-broadened neon gain curve. It isn't present in
all such lasers, but under some conditions, mostly determined by the design
of the laser, it will appear as a small depression
at the exact center of the neon gain curve where its peak should be, as shown
in <A HREF="lambdip1.gif">The Lamb dip in a Helium-Neon Laser</A>.  (The
Lamb dip is not something that comes and goes, though the health
of the laser tube and thus its gain does affect it.)
In a nutshell, the explanation is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Wherever the lasing line is located, as determined by the resonance
 condition being met in the Fabry-Perot cavity (c/2L longitudinal mode),
 the available gain is slightly reduced because the upper energy state is
 being partially depleted by stimulated emission.
<p>
<li>Counter-intuitively, it is also reduced by a similar amount on the
 <i>opposite </i> side of the neon gain curve equidistant from the peak
 since the Doppler-broadened population of excited atoms has to appear
 identical to photons traveling in either direction in the standing wave
 (Fabry-Perot) cavity.
<p>
<li>As the cavity length changes and the longitudinal mode and lasing line
 approaches the center of the neon gain curve, the two areas of reduced gain
 begin to merge.
<p>
<li>Since the lasing process is now drawing energy from the same excited
 population of atoms (rather than two separate populations), the gain is
 further reduced in that area resulting in a dimple or dip there.
</ul>
<p>
The Doppler-broadened neon gain curve reslly respresents a distribution
of atomic velocities, with zero velocity being at the center.  Atoms moving
toward a photon traveling down the (Z) axis of the laser have a higher
frequency at which stimulated emission can occur.  Atoms moving away from
a photon traveling down the (Z) axis of the laser have a lower frequency
at which stimulated emission can occur.  So, a photon traveling in the +Z
direction will only be able to produce stimulated emission if an excited
atom that it encounters is moving with the specific velocity needed to
Doppler shift the neon gain center frequency by the appropriate amount
so it equals (within the natural line width) the photon's frequency.  If
the photon's frequency is above the neon center, then the atom must be
moving toward the photon with a velocity of, say, -V.  However, the exact
same conditions will be met by a photon traveling in the -Z direction and
an atom traveling with a velocity of +V.  And this is exactly the same offset
from the center on the opposite side of the Doppler-broadened neon gain curve.
Thus, the result is two depressions until the cavity tuning is such that the
F-P resonance condition is at the very center and the lasing process is drawing
on the zero velocity population.
<p>
In the diagram, the cavity tuning is increasing in frequency (the cavity
is getting shorter) clockwise for each successive residual gain curve (1 to 5).
The "Unsaturated Gain" is present when there is no cavity to enhance
stimulated emission, or below the
lasing threshold.  The "Saturated Gain" is present while lasing.
And the "Output Power" is the useful beam from the Output Coupler (OC),
the partially transparent mirror.  (The amplitude of the dips
in the diagram are somewhat exaggerated compared to what is typical
in practice, and nothing is guaranteed to be to scale!)  Though the dip pairs
can't be observed in the output of the laser, they would show up if the
single pass gain were measured using a probe beam from a tunable laser
passed down the bore of the tube.  Energy is being extracted from
the gain curve to produce the intra-cavity (and output) beams through
stimulated emission.  So, what's left will be reduced in the areas
where this takes place.  (And there's an entire scientific field called "Lamb
dip Spectroscopy" that involves the finer points of this phenomenon.)
(A more detailed explanation of the Lamb dip can be found at the end
of this section.)
<p>
Under the proper conditions (more below), the Lamb dip will result
in a very pronounced variation in laser output power as the cavity
is tuned, and this can be used to accurately lock the laser to the center of
the neon gain curve.  The locking technique is actually quite simple:
The cavity length - and thus the optical frequency - is periodically
varied, or "dithered" by a small amount (a few MHz) via a PZT to which the HR
mirror is attached.  This results in a corresponding variation in laser
output power based on the profile of the neon gain curve on either side
of lasing mode location.  The optical power is sensed via a photodiode
monitoring the waste beam from the HR mirror.  The lasing line can then be
maintained at the exact center of the neon gain curve where the
Lamb dip is located by satisfying two conditions:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring there to be no first harmonic in the detected light output,
 which means that the signal is symmetric with respect to tuning.
<p>
<li>Assuring that the rectified dither signal and detected light output
 signals are in phase.
</ol>
<p>
(1) locks to an inflection point and (2) forces it to be a local minima.
<p>
The electronics is designed to generate a low speed correction signal to drive
the PZT to maintain these conditions.  In modern terminology, the circuitry to
do this would be called a lock-in amplifier, phase-sensitive detector, or
synchronous demodulator.  Even using 1960s technology, it isn't very
complex.
<p>
The SP-119 system can still be used with manual control of wavelength
(Lambda, or equivalently, optical frequency), which varies the DC voltage
on the PZT via a 10 turn pot on the front paenl of the SP-259.  After a
short 3 hour warmup :), the wavelength (and thus optical frequency) will
be fairly stable as a result of the thermal regulation of the resonator.
But once the approximate gain center has been found by monitoring
the servo error (on the built in meter), switching to the "Lock"
position should maintain the laser on the center of the neon gain curve
(center of the Lamb dip) indefinitely.  Should the system lose lock
for any reason, even momentarily, an "Error Alarm" indicator will latch on.
<p>
A number of requirements must be satisfied to result in
a pronounced Lamb dip (or any Lamb dip at all) whose center
frequency is relatively independent of tube current and output
power, and it's not generally observed in common commercial HeNe
lasers.  The most important of these are probably:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The homogeneous linewidth of the lasing process must be much narrower
 than the gain bandwidth of the lasing medium.  The homogeneous linewidth
 results from homogeneous broadening of the natural linewidth,
 which is what would be present if all the atoms
 were in an identical environment (no Doppler or other broadening)
 and emitted their photons spontaneously (no laser cavity).  In a gas
 laser, collisions between atoms and other effects result in homogeneous
 broadening, while the Doppler effect of the velocity distribution of
 atoms is the dominent contribution to inhomogeneous broadening.
<p>
 For the HeNe laser, the homogeneous linewidth is about 100 MHz compared
 to the 1.5 to 1.6 GHz for the full inhomogeneously Doppler-broadened gain
 bandwidth (FWHM) of neon.
<p>
<li>The center of the gain curve must correspond to
 zero velocity, not just an average from multiple closely-spaced peaks
 or a smeared out emission function.
<p>
 The SP-119 uses isotopically pure He<sup>3</sup> and
 Ne<sup>20</sup> which results in a Doppler-broadened neon gain curve
 where zero velocity actually corresponds to the very center or peak.
 This is required for the symmetry condition as noted above.  With
 mixed isotopes and a smeared out gain curve - or one with multiple
 peaks - the merging of the symmetric dips would not be distinct or
 coincide with the neon gain curve center
<p>
<li>The laser must use a standing wave cavity where light is traveling in
 both directions with (nearly) equal amplitude inside the gain medium.
 A unidirectional ring cavity will have no Lamb dip.  However, a bidirectional
 ring cavity like the one in a ring laser gyro can have Lamb dip if the other
 conditions are satisfied, though doing so would be difficult in practice.
<p>
 The SP-119 has a conventional linear Fabry-Perot (standing wave) resonator.
<p>
<li>The gain must be fully saturated in a large part of the intra-cavity
 mode volume.
<p>
 The SP-119 uses a (nearly) hemispherical resonator
 configuration with the rear (HR) mirror being planar and the front (OC)
 having a RoC just slightly greater than the
 cavity length (to guarantee resonator stability).  This results in
 the diameter of the intra-cavity mode volume near
 the HR mirror being very narrow which fully saturates the gain in
 that region and results in a reliable Lamb dip regardless of overall
 gain, which changes as the tube ages.
<p>
<li>A short enough resonator must be used such that only a single mode can
 lase when it is in the area of the Lamb dip.
<p>
 The SP-119 resonator is just under 10 cm long corresponding to an FSR of
 over 1.5 GHz.  So, the nearest adjacent longitudinal mode is 1.5 GHz away
 and well into the tail of the neon gain curve.
</ol>
<p>
In fact, even very short barcode scanner HeNe laser tubes like the Melles Griot
05-LHR-007 (mirror spacing of 110 mm, 1.36 GHz FSR) show no evidence of a Lamb
dip.  Though these tubes typically have a long radius hemispherical resonator
and satisfy most of the other requirements, they may not have isotopically
pure gases.
<p>
And note that while longer tubes like the SP-088 (or Melles
Griot 05-LHR-088) may produce a very distinct
valley when one mode is near the center of the neon gain curve as shown in
<A HREF="sp088m2.gif">Plot of Spectra-Physics 088 HeNe Laser Tube During
Warmup (Detail)</A>, this is NOT the Lamb dip, but simply a consequence
of the relative amplitudes of the other modes that are oscillating.
However, the SP-259 should have no trouble locking a
longer laser tube to that valley.  I may try that
using a one-Brewster HeNe laser tube with the OC mirror on a PZT,
configured to be about the same length as an 088.  But, this would
not result in a single frequency laser unless the cavity were somewhat
shorter as there would probably be two other weak modes lasing on the
tails of the neon gain curve.  Since all modes have the same polarization
orientation due to the Brewster window, it's not possible to suppress
these unwanted adjacent modes.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hstsp119s">Using the SP-259B to Control Some Other
Stabilized HeNe Laser</A>.
<p>
<b>More on the Lamb dip:</b>
<p>
The following much more detailed explanation of the Lamb dip
was excerpted from Professor Tony Siegman's book, LASERS,
Chapter 30, page 1,199: "Hole Burning and Saturation Spectroscopy".
<p>
(Forwarded by: Confused2.)
<p>
At the beginning of the chapter, he starts with saturation of homogenous media
and notes that saturation at a particular frequency within the atomic
linewidth results in a reduction or shrinkage everywhere of both the
real and imaginary susceptibilty curves.  He emphasizes this with "a
strong saturating signal even well out in the wing of the atomic
transition will, if strong enough, saturate the entire transition
uniformly across its line shape."  Thus, hole burning cannot exist
in homogenous media.
<p>
In section 30.6: "Inhomogeneous Laser Oscillation: Lambs Dips", he goes on:
"In an early and widely read analysis of the gas lasers, Willis Lamb
predicted, and experimenter soon confirmed an unexpected aspect of
Doppler-broadened gas laser oscillation.  If we tune the resonance
frequency of a single oscillating cavity mode across a Doppler-
broadened gas laser transition, the curve of oscillation power output
versus cavity frequency shows a comparatively sharp and narrow dip in
output power when the oscillation frequency coincides with the center
of the Doppler broadened line."  He notes that the Lamb dip only occurs in
standing wave cavities and "is a consequence of saturation and hole
burning effects in the Doppler-broadened line, caused by two
oppositely traveling waves in the cavity."
<p>
"Physical explanation:
The signal field inside a standing wave cavity can be divided into two
oppositely directed traveling waves which we have referred to as +z
and -z waves.  Any single atom with axial velocity v thus sees two
opposing traveling waves, for which it has equal and opposite Doppler
shifts, even thought the two waves are at the same frequency.  This
leads to double whole burning effects" and thus a Lamb dip.
"Consider a laser with an inhomogeneous Dopper-broadened transition
oscillating in a single frequency standing-wave axial mode resonance,
with the frequency w of this resonance detuned from the atomic line
center by several inhomogeneous linewidths or whole widths....  The
traveling +z wave component of the standing wave cavity fields will
interact with and burn a hole in only those atoms in the velocity
class given by v/c-w0-w/w0; while at the same time the fields in the -
z traveling wave component will burn an equal and opposite hole in
the symmetrically located velocity class at opposite value of v/c.
Whenever the cavity frequency is well away from line center on either
side.  Therefore, two symmetric holes are burned, and in essence the
laser is able to extract power from two separated set of atoms or
velocity classes in the atomic velocity distribution8on."
<p>
"Velocity class" is jargon for a small range of velocities (never 
thought about why the term "class" was used, but that was the usual 
terminology from the beginning).  As usual when considering continuous 
distributions, "small" is not precisely defined, but is to be taken as 
meaning a range small enough that all the atoms within it act more or 
less the same - in other words, somewhat smaller than the velocity 
spread that would create a Doppler frequency shift larger than the 
atomic linewidth of those atoms.  You can start off thinking of a 
discrete number of velocity classes, which you sum over; then make these 
classes narrower and more numerous, until you're really integrating 
rather than summing, in which case each velocity class takes on in fact 
a differentially small range."
<p>
"If, however, the cavity frequency is tuned exactly to the line center,
both the +z and -z waves can interact only with the v=0 velocity class in
the Dopper distribution.  This velocity class is therfore saturated
twice as heavily as either of the separate velocity classes in the off-
resonance situation because it sees two signal instead of one.  But
this means that the laser need only oscillate roughly half as hard to
produce the same degree of saturation needed to reduce the gain to
equal the cavity losses.  In essence the two symmetric holes coalesce
into one, and the laser power is taken from the single velocity classes
v=0.  In the inhomogeneously broadened single frequency laser this
results in the slight, but definite dip in laser power at the line
center known as the Lamb dip."

<h4><A NAME="hstsp119h">SP-119 Laser Head</A></h4>

The SP-119 laser head uses a short two-Brewster plasma tube with a large gas
reservoir on the side.  It is filled with isotopically pure
He<sup>3</sup> and Ne<sup>20</sup>.
The Spectra-Physics model number on the tube label may be either
053 or simply 119.  Some views of an orphan 053 tube can be found in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
under "Spectra-Physics Helium-Neon Lasers".
<p>
Since the SP-119 locks on the center of the gain curve using the Lamb dip
rather than on one side of it,
the resonator needs to be somewhat shorter than those of
dual polarization mode stabilized lasers to guarantee that
adjacent longitudinal modes - which have the same
polarization and thus can't be separated from the middle one - are
are far enough away that they don't have enough
gain to oscillate within the 1.6 GHz Doppler-broadened neon gain curve.
The active discharge length is 7 cm while the
distance between the mirrors is 9.7 cm corresponding to an FSR of
a bit over 1.5 GHz.  This very short cavity length is
intended to guarantee that at most, only a single mode can lase.
However, as a practical matter, it's quite possible a somewhat
smaller FSR would be adequate, and provide more output power in the
lasing mode.  In fact, with such a large FSR, there may be no lasing at
all over a portion of the mode sweep cycle - where two adjacent modes
are on the tails of the neon gain curve.  One paper that mentions the
SP-119 suggests that 10 cm RoC mirrors are used
to assure a single spatial mode (TEM00) beam profile.  (But I don't know
if these are exactly the RoC used in the standard
SP-119 laser.  See "Pressure Shifts in a Stabilized Single
Wavelength Helium-Neon Laser", A. L. Bloom and D. L. Wright,
Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 54, no. 10, Oct., 1966, pp. 1290-1294.)
With the very short cavity, the output power varies significantly
over a mode cycle and the beam may disappear entirely over a portion
of it, especially with a weaker tube.
<p>
There are no real adjustments for mirror alignment
as this is determined by the precision ground
resonator assembly.  (Though, tightening the various screws
that hold the resonator sections together have some effect!)
However, there are bore centering
adjustments, which essentially align the bore to the
mirrors. :)  The HR mirror is on a PieZo Transducer
(PZT) for cavity length control.  The
active part of the tube (the bore and Brewster windows), mirrors, and
PZT, as well as a heater and sensor for thermal control, are
all enclosed in a Mu-Metal cover to shield the gain region
from stray magnetic fields.
<p>
I first acquired an SP-119 laser head (Model 119, SN# 3143-532) but
no controller.  It appears to be mostly complete though the output
beam expander was missing.  That was probably the only thing the
previous owner considered useful after completing experiments with
the laser!
<p>
The wiring is rather overly complex with 3 separate cables that run between
the laser head and controller.  (In fact, the fancier version that goes
with the servo lambda control unit has 4 cables; this one lacks the
cable for the photodetector.)  The cable and connector for the external
HeNe laser power supply is HUGE, a bit excessive considering that it's
basically a sub-1 mW-class tube!  This is pre-Alden though.
<p>
I had absolutely no doubt that this tube (call it #1) would be completely dead
and up to air.  However, upon removing the top cover, I was almost dazzled by
the getter spot, which was huge and nearly like new.  Something wasn't right
here.  I'd expect that with a modern hard-seal tube, but not something
presumably from the 1960s.  With a modern HeNe laser power supply hot-wired
to the tube directly, it lit instantly with a bright stable discharge,
but no sign of an output beam.  See <A HREF="sp119t1.jpg">Spectra-Physics
119 HeNe Laser Tube 1 With Good Complexion</A>.  The large silver/black
getter spot with just the slightest evidence of contamination around its
periphery is visible near the top of the photo.  The white block contains
the ballast resistor normally used with the SP power supply.  The cylinder
on the left is the Mu-Metal and thermal cover for the tube bore, optics,
and PZT.
<p>
Then I noticed a sticker that had fallen off the side of the tube:
<p>
<PRE>
   HeNe 9:1 @ 4.0 Torr   2-14-86
   Isotopes 3 & 20
   Mfg. by El Don Engineering
</PRE>
<p>
El Don Engineering is apparently a company founded by the brother of
the owner of Jodon, Inc., but now defunct as Google could find no
reference to it.
<p>
So, this was a rebuilt or replacement tube manufactured in 1986, and with
a decent sealing technique as there has been almost no leakage.
<p>
There are photos of the Spectra-Physics 053, the tube that was
probably the original one from the SP-119 laser in the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser
Equipment Gallery</A> under "Spectra-Physics HeNe Lasers".
Tube #1 in my SP-119 laser head doesn't have quite as large a gas reservoir
but is otherwise identical with the short two-Brewster bore
mounted on the side far away from the gas reservoir.
The main bore and Brewster windows are hidden by the Mu-Metal cover
but there is little doubt that it they are similar.  Note how short the
bore is - the 7 cm active gain region is similar
to what is in a 1 mW tube with internal mirrors, and there will be significant
losses through the Brewster windows, so the output power of this tube
will be lower.  (As noted above, the spec'd output power is
only 70 &micro;W.)
<p>
Why wasn't it lasing?  I would have expected it to be burning holes in
the wall. :)  Sure, alignment could be messed up and/or the
optics could be dirty after 20+ years.  But then I carefully
looked in the ends) and at first thought there were no
mirrors!  The discharge was clearly visible and bright with no hint of
the blue coloration or reflections that would be present with 633 nm mirrors.
Someone ripped the mirrors out for other projects?  Ridiculous!
That didn't make any sense.  Not only would it be rather substantial effort
to get to the mirrors to remove them and then put everything back
in place without even any missing screws, but why bother?  Aren't
they just ordinary red HeNe mirrors?
<p>
Then something occurred to me: That 4.0 Torr is a rather high pressure for a
632.8 nm HeNe laser and the discharge was rather bright and more orange than
usual, which would be consistent with the higher pressure.  Normally,
it should be 2 to 3 Torr for a visible HeNe laser.  And a 9:1 He:Ne ratio is
also rather high - 5:1 to 7:1 would be more typical.  The use of isotopically
pure gases is also something that wouldn't be used routinely in common HeNe
lasers, at least not back then.  But all three of these would make sense if
someone wanted to do experiments with an <i>IR</i> stabilized HeNe laser!  So I
dug out my IR detector card.  At first I didn't see anything.  But in
a dark room, there was just the faintest evidence of a lasing spot.
Yikes!  A 20+ year old tube still lasing on a (likely) low gain IR
line in a 40+ year old laser!  Not only is this laser still functional,
it is a most unusual specimen!
<p>
Next to determine the wavelength.  There are only two HeNe IR lasing
lines that are likely: 1,152 nm and 1,523 nm.  I suppose 3,391 nm might also
be possible but I don't think my IR card would show it.  There are more
than a half dozen other near-IR HeNe lasing wavelengths, but their gain
is much lower and I've never heard of anyone doing anything with them
except to prove they are possible.  A thermal laser
power meter barely registered anything, perhaps 20 &micro;W.  But the silicon
photodiode-based power meter I use for testing HeNe lasers <i>also</i>
had a barely detectable response.  If the wavelength had been longer
than 1,100 nm or so, a silicon photodiode would have been totally
blind.  So, the lasing wavelength is most likely 1,152 nm.  That is also
consistent with the color of the mirrors (or lack thereof).  Mirrors for
1,523 nm tend to have a slightly pink or tan appearance in transmission,
and green appearance in reflection.  Mirrors for 3,391 nm also have rather
pronounced characteristics - possibly clear for the OC but often totally
opaque for the HR.
<p>
After playing with the mirror adjustments for awhile (including losing lasing
and having to use an external alignment laser to get it back!), I was able
to increase output power by a factor of 2 to 3, to somewhere between 50 and
75 &micro;W.  For a two-Brewster tube this short and optics that were probably last
cleaned over 20 years ago on the weak IR line, that is certainly acceptable. :)
I don't know what the HeNe gain is at 1,152 nm but if it's similar to
the gain at 1,523 nm, a tube that produces 5 mW at 633 nm will only
produce 0.5 mW at 1,523 nm.  The tube in the SP-119 is at best good
for 0.5 mW at 633 nm if it had internal mirrors.  It will be less with
the two-Brewster window tube.  The SP brochure only specs 70 &micro;W at
633 nm!  So a similar output power at 1,152 nm is truly amazing.
<p>
Now the question becomes: What do I do with this laser?  Retain it in its
present form as a something unique in the Universe, and also probably rather
useless for anything I'd want to do?  Or, replace the mirrors with normal
HeNe 633 nm mirrors and have another 0.5 mW laser, but one that's consistent
with the original SP-119?  This is the dilemma I face! ;-)  One thing is
certain, I won't attempt any mirror transplants until I've had a chance
to examine another (probably dead) specimen of this laser to determine
the required technique that would minimize exposure of the Brewster windows
since cleaning them is not likely to be a pleasant experience.
<p>
I later acquired another SP-119 tube (call it #2) including heater
jacket (thanks Kevin!), but no laser head OR controller. :)
(At least I assume it's an SP-119 tube since I am not aware of other
lasers that used one that is similar and can't imagine that there are any.)
See <A HREF="sp119t2.jpg">Spectra-Physics 119 HeNe Laser Tube 2 With Good
Complexion</A>.  The distance from Brewster tip to Brewster tip is about
3-5/8" (9.2 cm).  The actual bore is enclosed by the black cover.
I had assumed this was a heater jacket used for thermal control in the
SP-119 laser, but it seems rather odd to put it only around the bore.
On this sample at least, it is Epoxied in place and definitely
non-removable.  A pair of wires goes inside with
a resistance between them of around 300 ohms, kind of high for
a heater in the feedback loop, but I later found this to be used
during Standby where the laser tube is turned off.  It provides
a power dissipation similar to that of the bore discharge, so that the
time to stabilize after coming out of Standby is greatly reduced.
What's interesting is that for this wimpy tube, the output power
reaches its stellar value of 15 &micro;W or so whether the tube has run
or simply has been in Standby and thus at a similar temperature.
<p>
This tube (#2) had no sticker on it but the glassowrk is the same as
that of the geniune Spectra-Physics 053 tube so it is probably original,
or a non-El Don exact copy.  (Stickers don't generally fall off of
SP tubes!)  It may have never been used and has a large portion of the getter
spot remaining.  As can be seen, it lights up nicely and the
bottom photo is especially spectacular with subdued lighting. :)
The operating voltage is nice and low, it starts instantly, and
runs stably at a very low current - down to 3 mA or less.
The discharge in the expanded tubing doesn't appear quite as orange as
the other one, so it may be filled at lower pressure for the normal
633 nm (red) wavelength, but it's hard to really tell without seeing
the exposed bore, and that isn't going to happen. :)

<h4><A NAME="hstsp119e">SP-259 Exciter</A></h4>

After receiving the second SP-119 tube, I knew I'd have to find a
controller.  So, I worked a deal on a complete SP-119 system from
<A HREF="http://www.bmius.com/">BMI Surplus Equipment Brokers</A>,
as this was the only place where Google was able to find one for sale.
Most of the other hits were old research papers with
arcane titles and only passing mention of the SP-119, or links
here. :)  And I also bought (Gasp!) a copy of the "119 Gas Laser
Operator Manual" from <A HREF="http://www.vintagemenuals.com/">Vintage
Manuals</A>.
<p>
The laser head is Model 119-3683, SN# 578, and the controller is
Model 259-3664, SN# 579.  Overall, the system is in very good
condition for equipment at least 36 years
old.  The interior of both the laser head and controller
could pass for new, with only minor signs of wear on the exteriors, some
rotted rubber grommets in various places, and decayed foam pads cushioning
the tube.  They must have been well stored as there is even very little
dust inside.
<p>
The power supply/controller (what SP called an "exciter") for the
SP-119 laser head is the SP-259.  This one is labeled 259B.  I'm not sure
what the difference is between the "B" and straight 259 or 259A, if
there is one (though the improved specifications seem to be associated
with the B version).  The only obvious difference is that
the 259B has a three position switch for Lambda (frequency) Modulation -
Off, 60 Hz, and External, while the original 259 only has a toggle
for Off or On, with the External BNC.  The modulation (input) bandwidth is
at least 20 kHz, though the p-p optical frequency excursion does
drop off from 1.2 GHz between 10 Hz and 3 kHz, but only 200 MHz at 20 kHz.
<p>
To emphasize how ancient the design of this system really is, the SP-259B
uses <i>vacuum tubes</i> in the HeNe laser power supply.  A 6GJ5 high
voltage beam power tube is the current regulator, controlled by a
a 12AX7 used as a differential amplifier with a 0A2 gas tube
(basically a big glass 150 V zener diode) as the voltage reference.
And the main power supply uses four more 0A2s.
Based on the date from the SP brochure (above), the original
SP-259 was available in 1964.  Or at least SP starting testing the
market for the SP-119 laser in 1964!  However, my SP-259B has what appear to be
date codes on the main electrolytic capacitors of 1973 if I'm interpreting
the labeling correctly (and assuming they are original).  The latest date of
the Operator Manual is 1966.
<p>
The SP-259 provides the following functions:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>HeNe laser power supply:</b> This is by far most of the 259B by
 volume at least. :)  The HV doubler and filter alone is about the size of an
 entire SP-155 laser!  And then there is a large power transformer and
 the 6GJ5, 12AX7, one of the OA2 tubes.  A recessed pot below the "On"
 label of the main selector/meter switch allows for the tube current
 to be adjusted from about 3.5 to 9 mA.
<p>
<li><b>Temperature controller:</b> The laser resonator is inside a heater
 which must be maintained at a constant temperature for long term cavity
 length adjustment.  Without the 259-002 Servo Option, this alone is
 sufficient to keep the lasing line reasonably well in position.  The
 heater is an 18 ohm power resistor and is driven with up to about 16 V.
 A 10K thermistor is used as the temperature sensor in a bridge configuration
 with proportional control - just a high gain AC amplifier driving an
 active full wave rectifier.  The set-point is when the thermistor
 resistance is 2.5K ohms - about 60 &deg;C.
<p>
<li><b>PZT driver:</b> Fast, small changes in cavity length are achieved
 via the PZT on which the HR mirror is attached.  In manual mode, the
 PZT voltage can be varied from about 10 to 215 V via the 10-turn pot
 on the 259-001 Manual Lambda Adjust unit or the 259-002 Servo Option.
 When in Lock mode, a HV amp drives the PZT based on feedback from the
 servo electronics.
<p>
<li><b>Photodiode preamp (with 259-002 only):</b> The very low level
 signal from the photodiode mounted behind the HR mirror must be
 amplified to be adequate for servo lock to be achieved.
<p>
<li><b>Wavelength control:</b>
 <ul>
<p>
 <li><b>Manual Lambda Control (259-001):</b> A 10 turn pot allows for the
  fine adjustment of cavity length via the PZT on which the HR mirror
  is attached.  The range is approximately 3 FSRs.  The pot, a fixed
  resistor, and several jumpers are the only parts inside the 259-001!
<p>
 <li><b>Automatic Lambda Control (Servo Option 259-002):</b> May be selected
  among manual control (same as 259-001), Servo Null for adjustment of
  the center position, and then set to Lock, which will maintain lambda.
  A Lock Alarm indicator is illuminated and latches on if lock is lost
  for any reason, even momentarily.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Meter circuitry:</b> The large panel meter is the primary means
 of checking operation of the various functions of the SP-119 system.
 It can select among HeNe laser power supply current, heater voltage,
 heater error (null), +300 VDC, -20 VDC, +50 VDC, and -150 VDC (259-001
 only, regulated) or Servo Null (259-002 only).
<p>
<li><b>DC Power supplies:</b>  Includes +300 VDC (regulated), -20 VDC
 (unregulated), +50 VDC (regulated), and -150 VDC (regulated,
 (259-001 only).  There is also a 60 Hz output for the internal
 modulation function.
<p>
<li><b>Standby heater supply:</b>  When the system is in Standby (and
 the laser is off), an AC source substitutes for the power provided by the
 HeNe laser tube bore discharge.  A recessed pot below the "Standby" label
 on the main selector/meter switch allows for the Standby power to be adjusted
 over a range of approximately 50 precent.
</ul>
<p>
Before applying power, I checked the ESR of most of the electrolytic
capacitors and they all were reasonable.  Even those orange Sprague
Atoms showed very low ESR, so I don't know why one of them seemed to
have been unhappy in the past.  It's also not entirely clear why they
need to be rated at 600 V as I only measured about 400 V on them.
So, this gave me confidence to actually apply power to this thing.  Only the
HeNe laser tube connector is plugged in so far.
<p>
And, you're not going to believe this, but the laser works, sort of.
I'm getting a maximum output power of a whopping 15 &micro;W from this tube (call
it #3).  Despite the cloud of death getter, the discharge color doesn't look
all that bad.  I wouldn't be totally surprised if it had been
regased, without replacing the getter.  Just a chop, suck, and fill job,
but better than nothing.  I can't say it's perfect color, but
certainly not dead.  However, that decayed foam suggests that tube might be
original.  The beam (I'm being generous here!) slowly
goes on and off as the very short cavity (which is
not yet temperature controlled) expands, and it only lases when
a single mode is near the center of the neon gain curve.
The on-off behavior is probably normal due to the large FSR
of the cavity, close to the width of the neon gain curve,
though the low gain exaggerates the effect.
I suspect that at least part of the lack of power may be due to
contamination on the Brewster windows or mirrors.  However,
the major cause may still be an old, well used, tired tube.
And even if it is partly due to contamination, this doesn't help
that much - cleaning optics on this thing will be a real treat!
What, contamination after 36 years?  No way. :)
<p>
The power-on of the HeNe laser tube is itself interesting.  Since the current
regulation is via a vacuum tube, and that needs to warm up to conduct,
the laser tube comes on and sputters for a few seconds, then appears to
stay on dimly and gradually increases up to a normal discharge brightness.  
According to the Operator Manual, the current is adjustable 
from about 4 to 10 mA, with the normal range between 4 and 6 mA.  For
some reason, this one refuses to go below about 5.5 mA, and sort of
doubles back.  At first, I assumed it was a problem in the circuity
since during the initial warmup, the tube starts out at much
less than 6 mA and seems to remain on steady as the current ramps up.
But, perhaps it's really flickering too fast to see.  Geez, after 36 years,
a bad part, no way!  So, initially, I set it at 6 mA and proceeded to
other checks.
<p>
Aside from the wimpy output power, the only thing I found wrong so far is that
the power neon indicator lamp was burnt out, no doubt from the system
being left on 24/7 for a 100 years.  So I replaced that. :)
<p>
Then, figuring, "what the heck", I plugged in the other 3 cables and after
actually reading the Operator Manual (what a concept?!) proceeded to go
through the power up checklist, checking the meter readings for voltages,
that the heater seemed to be working, and that adjusting the 10 turn
Lambda pot actually changed the cavity length.  All were satisfactory.
So, then I switched to "Servo Null", the active stabilization mode.
And, would you believe it #2, the thing
actually locks, even with the very low output power!  See
<A HREF="sp119l1.jpg">Spectra-Physics 119 Laser Head with 259B Exciter -
Locked</A>.  It's very twitchy as it warms up
and won't stay locked for long because something is drifting, but that is
truly amazing.  However, I didn't wait the three hours as stated in
the manual.  Oh, and the "Lock Alarm" lamp, a GE-334, was also burnt out,
so I stuffed a GE-327 into the socket (same electrical specs, slightly
larger diameter, only requiring a nano-crowbar to make it fit).  Eventually,
that may become an LED.  Why can't designers learn to run incandescent
lamps at reduced voltage?!
<p>
Later, I returned to the laser tube current peculiarity where
adjustment of the current pot does not result in a monotonic change in current,
but has a fold-back characteristic with hysteresis.  When first powered
on, it could be pulled down to about 5.5 mA before abruptly jumping
to 7 or 8 mA, and then going only down to 6.5 mA or so even fully
counterclockwise.  After being on for awhile, that minimum increases to
close to 6 mA.  When turning the pot clockwise, it must go past the point
where the minimum would have been, and then abruptly jumps to a high
current.  And, if set at close to 6 mA and powered off for awhile,
when powered back on, it might not "catch" and end up at 7 or 8 mA.
After trying both tubes #1 and #2 (above), I am virtually
certain that this anomoly is associated with the laser tube and not the power
supply.  (Or, at least, is the result of the I-V characteristics of laser
tube #3.)  There were no problems adjusting the current on those tubes from
3.5 mA to more than 9 mA with no kinks and no hysteresis.  So, suspecting that
this tube has problems staying lit below about 6 mA (not exactly surprising
for a high mileage tube), I powered it from my test supply, and sure enough,
it wouldn't stay lit below about 5.5 mA.  Perhaps the power supply does
funny things when a current is dialed in that's below where the tube
will stay lit, either by chance or by design to prevent continuous
restarts or sputtering, which can damage both laser tubes and power supplies.
Adding some ballast resistance closer to the tube anode might help
some as the main 70K ohm ballast is at least 6 inches away.
But there is little point since (1) 6 mA is still an acceptable
current and (2) the output power will be even lower at reduced current -
power continues to increase to well beyond the 9 or 10 mA maximum!
<p>
Then I tackled the drift of servo settings, which resulted in the
sensitivity of photodiode output declining and the set-point changing as
the system warmed up.  Shortly after
power-on - in fact about as soon as there's a visible beam - it was
possible to lock reliably with only a few &micro;W of output power.  Only
after the system had been on for awhile did locking become more
problematic, even though the laser output power had increased
substantially.  (Well to 12 or 15 &micro;W!)  In addition, the meter didn't
respond in the "Servo Null" position, though that function appeared to
continue to respond.  I assumed that the servo unit was full of
germanium transistors and it was all too possible that one or
more of them was being affected by heat.
<p>
However, after poking around with an oscilloscope, the first problem was
that the adjustment of the frequency and symmetry of the multivibrator
that generates the dither signal wasn't behaving as expected.  I replaced
the ancient 2N697s (actually silicon transistors!) with 2N3904s and that
helped somewhat for no really good reason, since the specs are
similar to the 2N3904.  But then I noticed a rogue oscillation
at around 10 kHz that appeared only after the system
had warmed up.  This signal was present everywhere, and even showed up
across perfectly healthy filter capacitors.  That didn't make any sense.
There is not supposed to be any legitimate 10 kHz source and this signal
was coming from somewhere other than the servo unit since
grounding the input to the photodiode preamp made it go away.  On a hunch,
I figured that perhaps the cause was plasma oscillation in the HeNe laser
tube feeding back to the power supply, or even showing up in the optical
signal to the photodiode.  I knew that the tube was running just barely
above the dropout current, which is where such things tend to happen.  And,
sure enough, increasing the tube current by 0.5 mA to 6.5 mA made the 10 kHz
oscillation totally disappear.  Adding ballast resistance near the tube might
cure this as well as increasing the dropout current, but that's for
the future.  And 6.5 mA is still acceptable, and now the laser can be left
On or in Standby indefinitely with no noticeable drift.  In fact, even with
the miniscule amount of laser output power, it's now possible to adjust the
electronics for normal meter deflection when adjusting the Lambda pot
with the servo unit in the Null position.
<p>
So, aside from the wimpy output power, there appears to be nothing wrong
with the entire system.

<li><A HREF="sp119i1.jpg">Spectra-Physics Model 119 Laser Head - Interior
 View</A>.  Most of the good stuff is inside the metal cylinder, which is
 actually a Mu-Metal magnetic shield.   Since the laser cavity and optics
 are fully enclosed, there isn't much else of interest inside the 119 laser
 head.  The HV cable goes directly to the white Nylon block, which
 houses the ballast resistor and pin-jacks for the red (anode) and black
 (cathode) tube pin-plugs.  But some of the heater and PZT connections are
 attached via the terminal strip visible on the floor near the rear.
 The "Caution High Voltage" sticker is on the upper part of the
 "Cathode" or "Reservoir" clamp, which cushions the tube between
 foam pads.  The Spectra-Physics label which is mostly covered
 by the clamp simply identifies the tube as "119".

 Access to the front bore centering

 one on the opposite side tightened.

 The photodiode for the 259-002 Servo Option is inside the
 rectangular device screwed to the back of the Mu-Metal cylinder.
 There is a center hole in the rear Mu-Metal cover plate, and alos
 a small aperture in front of the photodiode to block bore light.

 Top View</A>.  The high voltage components of the HeNe laser power supply can
 be seen on the left, and are normally enclosed in a protective cover.  This
 uses a voltage doubler with additional filtering feeding the cap of the
 6GJ5 vacuum tube, which is the current regulator.  It is controlled by the
 12AX7 to the right of it, used as a differential amp.  The 0A2s are voltage
 references for the HeNe laser power supply and the PZT HV power supply.
 Interestingly, the laser tube anode is near ground potential, off of it by
 only the voltage drop across the current sense resistor.  The laser tube
 cathode has nearly the full high voltage of up to 5,000 V (before starting).
 There isn't any explicit starter - the HV transformer produces enough
 voltage so that when doubled, it is sufficient for starting, and the vacuum
 tube regulator simply deals with the current over a wide voltage compliance
 range.  And, this is, after all, a sub-mW HeNe laser, so both starting and
 operating voltages here aren't that huge.  All the HV components are just
 a wee bit larger than those found in a modern HeNe laser power supply,
 which would fit confortably inside one of those red HV caps! :)
<p>
 The only other circuitry on the main PCB, mostly hidden under the 259-002
 on the right, is the all solid state laser head heater controller.
<p>
 The larger transformer is for all the high voltages and vacuum
 tube filaments, while the smaller one is for the heaters and low level
 servo circuits.  In Standby mode, only the latter is powered.
<p>
 Aside from the pots for HeNe laser tube current and Standy heater power
 accessible from the front panel, the only other electronic adjustments in
 the entire system are two trimpots visible at the bottom right corner (dither
 frequency and symmetry) and the one labeled "Inc" (Servo gain), a 10
 or 20 turn trimpot accessible through a hole in the 259-002 cover.

 I'd replaced the three orange 20 uF, 600 V caps.  One had obviously
 overheated and leaked a bit already.  However, they all tested fine
 for uF and ESR, and after ramping up the voltage slowly using a Variac,
 have been working without problems during all my testing, which
 has lasted for many hours.  If I do eventually need to replace them,
 I may not pay attention to being totally authentic.  Exactly the same
 model Sprague Atom capacitors from vintage audio places
 run something like $10-20 <i>each</i>, if they are available at all.
 (And it's not clear how recently they have been manufactured.)  I
 can make the equivalent using modern components for under $5 total,
 replacing the original 20 uF, 600 V cap using a pair of 47 uF, 350 V radial
 caps in series, with equalizing resistors.  And they will still take up less
 space than the originals.

<b>Unresolved issue:</b>
<p>
This relates to the second SP-119 laser head (with tube #3) and the SP-259B
exciter as described and shown above:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Low output power:</b> Although the discharge color looks decent, this
 tube could simply be very high mileage - as is typical of <i>most</i>
 surplus stabilized HeNe lasers.  The mirrors themselves are permanently
 aligned by the design of the resonator.  Bore centering adjustment (which
 is somewhat equivalent) can be done via 4 screws at each end of the
 resonator.  But fiddling with these had no beneficial effect - the original
 positions were nearly optimal.  Output power increases with increasing
 tube current.  This could still be in part due to the need for
 B-window/mirror cleaning, but that's not something I want to tackle
 until other options are exhausted!  In fact, what I'd rather do is find
 another SP-119 laser head with a certifiably dead tube and good optics,
 rather than risk losing functionality of this one entirely.  However,
 given the the tube current peculiarity, a tired dying tube is still a
 distinct possibility.  There's no doubt this laser was run for an extended
 period of time as both the neon Power indicator and Lock Alarm lamps
 were burnt out!

<h4><A NAME="hstsp119s">Using the SP-259B to Control Some other Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h4>

The motivation here is that while working SP-119 laser heads may be rather
scarce, it should be possible to use the SP-259B (or a modern equivalent
fitting into 2 cubic inches) to stabilize a HeNe laser consisting of
a relatively short one-Brewster (1-B) laser tube with the external OC mirror
mounted on a PZT (piezo beeper).  While this setup probably will NOT
have an actual Lamb dip, there's enough lumpiness (very technical term!)
in the output power function with respect to mode sweep such that a
very strong locking effect should be achievable.
<p>
The 1-B tube I would use is the Melles Griot 05-LHB-270, which
has a narrow bore and is only 222 mm in length (just under 9 inches).
With an OC mirror mounted on a piezo beeper, the total cavity length
would still be only about 9 inches, similar to an SP-088.  A photodiode
behind a small aperture (to block bore light) would be mounted behind
the HR, well insulated from the anode voltage!
<p>
I have already done experiments with a similar setup as shown in
<A HREF="obteomp1.gif">One-Brewster HeNe Laser Tube with External
OC Mirror on PZT</A> and it does have
a very nicely shaped output power versus mode sweep as shown in
<A HREF="henesca1.jpg">Effect of Mirror Alignment on Scanning Cavity
HeNe Total Power Display</A>.  This set of photos was taken for another
purpose, but they do clearly show the very distinct valley,
also similar to that of the 088 tube.  One
uncertainly is what the response of the piezo beeper will be at the
5 kHz dither frequency of the SP-259B.   However, it is also 5 to 10
times more sensitive than the SP-119 PZT, so a simple filter network
may be able to compensate peculiarities in its response.  At the very
least, the DC sensitivity will need to be reduced.
<p>
A separate HeNe laser power supply might be required as the 05-LHB-270
requires considerably more operating and starting voltage than the SP-119 tube.
(The latter is probably what would really be the problem.)
To keep the internal HeNe laser power supply happy, a short tube or
dummy load could be connected, or the vacuum tubes could simply be
removed. :)
<p>
There should be no problems with the photodiode, but if the gain adjustment
on the SP-259B servo unit doesn't have enough range (because the power
in the waste beam may be higher than allowed for), a neutral density
filter or other means can be added to reduce it.
<p>
Note that with a laser based on this length 1-B tube, a pure
single frequency output will not likely be possible as two weak modes
will probably lase on the tails of the neon gain curve.  Since all the
modes have the same polarization, there is no way to suppress these.
However, if a one-perpendicular window (1-W) tube were used instead
(very rare), then the two weak modes would have the orthogonal
polarization, and a simple polarizing filter would eliminated them.
The closest modes with the same polarization would be around 1.5 GHz
away and would have no chance of lasing.  It might even be possible to
use a somewhat longer cavity and still achieve single frequency
operation with this setup.
<p>
An alternative to the 1-B or 1-W tube would be to use just the glass tube
from a Hewlett-Packard 5501A (without the magnet and optics).  This has
a relatively short cavity with an internal PZT.  The 5501A tube does
appear to have a mode shape with a Lamb dip, though I don't know for sure
if that's the cause.  However, to use a 5501A will require a HV amplifier
for the PZT as it needs about 1.5 kV to go through more than two FSRs, and
a beam sampler at the output of the tube since the waste beam is blocked
by the PZT.  And, it's a total joy to remove the glass tube from the
magnet assembly!  The tube I tested also had a peculiar mode flipping behavior
whereby it tended to be polarized in one plane on the forward stroke of the
PZT, and the orthogonal plane on the reverse stroke of the PZT, even across
multiple FSRs.  However, a relatively weak external magnetic field had an
effect, and with care placement and orientation of a weak magnet,
it could be convinced to act normally.  The Lamb dip
can be clearly seen in <A HREF="hp5501m4.gif">Modes of HP-5501A HeNe Laser
Tube 1 With No Magnetic Field</A> along with the mode flipping
anomaly, as well as some hysteresis and non-linearity in the PZT
response.  The flipping quirk wouldn't matter as far as Lamb dip locking
is concerned since only the output power is used, but the actual beam
polarization once locked might depend on, well, the flip of a coin. :)

<h2>Teletrac/Axsys Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hsttrac1">Teletrac Model 150-IV Stabilized HeNe Laser</A></h3>

Here is another example of a stabilized HeNe laser.  This one is similar
to the other commercial thermally-stabilized HeNe lasers
in terms of its principles of operation.  But the thermal control is well,
strange. :)
<p>
(Mostly from: Skywise (into@oblivion.nothing.com).)
<p>
This is a Teletrac 1 mW stabilized HeNe laser with built in interferometer
receiver.  Going to <A HREF="http://www.teletrac.com/">Teletrac, Inc.</A>
redirects to <A HREF="http://www.axsys.com/">Axsys Technologies</A>,
which only has information in their quarterly earnings reports
referencing the sale of the company.  But I found a user manual for
a later model, but similar laser at <A HREF=
"http://laser.physics.sunysb.edu/~victor/info/Teletrac_laser.pdf">Teletrac
Stabilized Single Frequency Long HeNe Laser</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/Teletrac_laser.pdf">Sam's
Backup of Teletrac Stabilized Single Frequency Long HeNe Laser</A>.
(This manual appears to be
for another Teletrac laser which may be similar to the ones described in the
sections: <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsttrac2">Teletrac Model 150 Stabilized HeNe
Laser 2</A> and <A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsttrac3">Teletrac Model 150 Stabilized
HeNe Laser 3</A>.  The general information and theory of operation should
be similar though.
<p>
The electronics for the receiver are totally independent of the rest of
the laser and are powered through its connector.
<p>
The HeNe laser tube itself has no markings. It's about 8 inches mirror to
mirror. According to the user manual I found on-line it's manufactured by Zygo.
Output is polarized.  (Tubes in some other Teletrac lasers are made by
Zygo but this one is Melles Griot. --- Sam.)
<p>
The output of the OC-end goes through a collimator to get a 1 cm low
divergence beam.  And it is LOW divergence. I once shot this thing out
my window to a brick wall about 1/4 mile away, took a walk and found the
beam to have barely grown, if at all.
<p>
The HR-end has what is obviously a mode detection assembly, but it's
all covered in shrink tubing.
<p>
A two terminal device (probably an LM335) is glued face down onto
the glass of the tube near the cathode end for temperature sensing.
<p>
There are two low wattage filament lamps under the tube for heating.
<p>
The HeNe laser power supply is a standard brick made by Power Technology, Inc.
<p>
Temperature regulation is done by two fan blades that vibrate, driven
by a piezo. The vent is on the bottom of the laser so I have to
make sure the 'tail' is sticking out in free space or it overheats
and the fan blades really start clattering.
<p>
From a cold start the laser reaches mode lock in about 11 minutes.
<p>
The receiver electronics are dirt simple. Just 3 good op-amps
(2 LM6361N and 1 LM353).  Everything else is just caps, resistors,
and two trim pots.  The board has space for two other 16 pin ICs
but the spots are empty with no labeling to infer their function.
It looks like the outputs are all analog.
On the board the wires going to the detectors are labeled SIN, COS,
and INT. I think the SIN and COS imply quadrature output,
but have no clue what the INT is.  That signal goes
to the chip that got really hot. The other two signals go to the
other op-amps, and I'm seeing signal there on their two test points.
<p>
Here's page with 31 photos and 1 Quicktime movie:
It's under the reference section of my
<A HREF="http://www.skywise711.com/lasers/">Lasers Page</A> but
here's a direct link:
<A HREF="http://www.skywise711.com/lasers/teletrac/teletrac.html">Teletrac
Interferometer Laser</A>.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The HeNe laser tube is from Melles Griot, regardless of what that
manual says.  It may be a 05-LHR-120 or similar tube, possibly selected to
for specific characteristics to optimize it for use in this application.
Some older Teletrac lasers like the ones described later in this chapter
did use Zygo tubes but not this one.
<p>
SIN and COS are the quadrature outputs from the optical receiver.  INT is the
"intensity" which is proportional to the total output and would be used to
compensate for variations in optical power due to tube aging and/or
interferometer alignment and losses.
<p>
The LED on the back of the laser that changes from red to green as the
modes cycle during warmup and then goes out when locked is a nice touch
and is present on all subsequent Teletrac (and Axsys) stabilized lasers.
<p>
I'm impressed with how simple and clever this system is, though some might
describe it in another way - a kludge. :-)
<p>
There is more on the likely way this laser is used in the section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsttrac3">Teletrac Model 150 Stabilized HeNe Laser 3</A>.
That laser uses an external interferometer and optical receiver which are
implemented in the same way.
<p>
I've since acquired an operational sample of this laser.  It's definitely an
interesting piece. :)

<h3><A NAME="hstaxsys1">Axsys Stabilized HeNe Laser 1</A></h3>

I have seen several newer (2004-2006) Axsys stabilized HeNe lasers.
This laser doesn't have the extra interferometer receiver and
runs on 12 VDC rather than 115 VAC.The rear panel is identical
to the Teletrac laser, above, except that it may say "Axsys"
instead of "Teletrac" (but not always).  The Control PCB
is labeled "Teletrac, and construction is obviously based on the Teletrac
designs, in particular of the Teletrac 150 described in the next
section.  Without the built-in interferometer receiver and its signal cable,
the hole is filled by a diagnostic connector which includes, among
other things, a lock status bit.
<p>
It has the same Melles Griot tube as the Teletrac laser (above).  The
actual model number is 05-LHR-219 with some -dash number.
Its output power exceeds 4 mW (!!) but the output power of the laser is
only a bit over 1 mW.  Even this wimpy output power
violates the safety sticker maximum rating of less than 1 mW!
There is a polarizing filter at the input to the beam expanding telescope
at an angle of +45 degrees looking toward the output of the laser,
and a 1/4 waveplate at its output.  So, the actual beam from an umodified
Teletrac laser is a single mode that is circularly polarized.  So this can
go directly into the interferometer optics without worrying about
orientation as the polarizing beam-splitter will separate it into
two linearly polarized (REF and MEAS) as required.  I was
surprised that the polarizer was a cheap filter and not a polarizing
beam-splitter cube, which would be of much higher optical quality and
have lower losses, resulting in much greater output power.
In fact, initially, because the the output had no obvious polarization
axes due to the quarter waveplate, I  thought the polarizer was simply a
neutral density filter to cut down on the output power to satisfy the safety
rating - and then to enable the output power to be easily readjusted
upward (at great expense to the owner!) as the tube aged. :)  The latter
I found out quickly to be bogus since removing that polarizing filter
isn't fun.  Without the polarizer, it produces a beam with right and left
circularly polarized modes 687 MHz apart (the longitudinal mode spacing
of the 05-LHR-219 tube).  Or, by removing the quarter waveplate, one or
two linearly polarized modes depending on whether the polarizer is
present.  In the latter case, the total output power would be
almost 4 mW.  Thus, regardless of the original intended application,
it could be set up as a nice general purpose stabilized HeNe laser.
<p>
The stabilization system uses a conventional Minco thin film heater
wrapped around the tube, rather than the light bulbs and piezo fans.
The control algorithm is implemented digitally with a PIC, quad digital
pot chip, and some other stuff. :)  A serial EEPROM/NVRAM
stores the calibration information unique to each laser.
Unfortunately, this basically means there is no easy way of making
adjustments that may be required as the tube ages, or if it is
replaced.  And troubleshooting and repair of the Control PCB with
no accessible (analog) signals and all its SMT components would not be fun.
I really can't imagine that the possible flexibility of the digital control
scheme has any functional benefits.  And, in fact, digital control may not
work as well as a garbage LM358 op-amp implementation.  But it probably does
enhance the job security of the designers!
<p>
After power-on, the controller appears to first check that the mode or modes
from the polarizing beam sampler at the HR-end of the laser tube are present
and of adequate power.  Only then does it turn on the heater at full power
(approximately 10 V across a 5 ohm resistance or about 20 W).
And based on one sample that refused to do so quickly,
the threshold (presumably contained
in the NVRAM) must be set within 15 to 20 percent of the tube's power when
new.  That laser refused to turn on the heater until a couple minutes after
a cold-start, and this was long enough that it gave up and flashed an error
code.  Then, power cycling would usually enable it to start up successfully
within a few seconds after that.
<p>
Once the heater is powered, warmup is quite rapid, with locking occuring
in around 5 minutes.  It probably uses the resistance of the heater as a
temperature sensor, switching to feedback control once it has increased
enough to exceed a stored reference value.
<p>
Once locked, the short term stability is quite good, but there is a slow
periodic variation in locked output power of perhaps 10 percent p-p.  This
settles out in several hours once the laser has reached thermal equilibrium.  I
suspect the cause is insufficient or lack of wedge in the HR mirror
and/or lack of AR coating on the HR mirror.  This results in an etalon
effect, causing variations in both waste beam and main beam power, both
intrinsic to the laser tube, and amplified through the feedback since
the power of the waste and main beam are no longer in a fixed ratio.
And the relative power of the two modes would also vary slightly.
<p>
I was hoping to repair the Control PCB rather than simply salvage the
almost new tube for use in some other stabilized laser like a Coherent 200
(which appears to use the same tube, or one close enough).  I suspected
that the AD8304 quad digital pot chip was bad as the "red" mode input
is stuck high.  Of course, it could have been something else like bogus
data read from the serial NVRAM.  The HeNe laser power supply was also
dead, and I suspect that my testing with a substitute power supply is
what actually damaged the Control PCB, though I'm not sure how.
However, an arc from the anode of the HeNe laser tube to the red
mode photodiode could conceivably have been the cause.  Really? :)
<p>
CAUTION 1: Be extremely careful around the anode area of the HeNe laser tube,
especially if there is a need to remove the heat-shrink insulation.  While
contact with the HV probably won't be lethal to you (just a shock and the
smell of burning flesh), it is very likely to jump from you to one of the
conveniently located cables in the vicinity and kill the controller.  It's
possible that arcing to the chssis (as with a hard-to-start tube) might
even do this.  Almost everything on the controller PCB is surface mount
which along with the PIC (Microchip PIC16C73A-20/SP) and its
serial NVRAM (Xicor X24C44P), makes troubleshooting virtually impossible.
I've managed to screw up the controllers on two separate lasers! :(
The symptoms then seem to be that the mode LED remains red and no longer
responds correctly, with a significant offset and difference in gain
(or more), the heater never turns on (even though its LED says its on),
and the firmware gives up after a few seconds and flashes the right-hand
green LED forever.  I suspect that at least part of what's really happening
is that the perhaps the NVRAM has gotten erased since removing the NVRAM
from its socket results in no noticeable difference in behavior.
Or, possibly there's nothing wrong with the NVRAM, but the PIC
is unable to communicate with it and/or the quad
digital pot chip that connects to the PD inputs (among other things).  So key
parameters never get initialized correctly.  I did reaplace the quad
digital pot chip with no change in behavior, but it's quite possible I screwed
up the SMT soldering!  The PIC remains slive though.  And with enough light
into the beam sampler to get the modes to switch back and forth from red
to green repetitively, the onset of it giving up can be delayed indefinitely.
So it's still looking at the inputs, for whatever good that does!
<p>
CAUTION 2: When using the X-Y adjustment screws to center the output from the
HeNe laser tube in the beam expander, DO NOT use a tool, only
finger rotation.  They are made of metal and press against the glass of
the laser tube, separated from it only by the not very compliant Minco
heater.  Too much force WILL crack the tube.  I also found this out the
hard way - after realigning the mirrors on a non-lasing tube to like-new
specifications.  :(
<p>
I did eventually try replacing the AD8304 (quad digital pot) on a bad
controller PCB with no obvious change in behavior.  My surface mount
rework skills are somwhat lacking, but I don't think that was the
problem since at the very least, behavior before and after were
identical.  I later found out that the X24C44P (NVRAM) was dead (or
erased).  In fact, I now have two of these lasers with bad
controllers, due to zapping.  One controller PCB seems to be fully
functional except for a bad or erased NVRAM.  It works normally with a
known good NVRAM except that the switchover threshold to feedback
control appears to be several degrees higher then another known good
controller PCB with the same PIC and NVRAM installed, possibly simply
due to normal component tolerances.  (The NVRAM in each controller
would be programmed for its specific tube, so swapping controllers
might not be an acceptable repair technique!)  The other seems
completely dead even with a known good PIC and NVRAM, except for
turning on the red status LED and the heater!), but the mode LED never
comes on and the laser never locks.
<p>

X24C44P NVRAM they would be able to copy or a dead (or alive!) laser like
this they would be willing to offer to the cause, please

<h3><A NAME="hsttrac2">Teletrac Model 150 Stabilized HeNe Laser 2</A></h3>

This is the Teletrac predecessor to the Axsys laser described above.  It
is in a virtually identical case with the same general arrangement of internal
components except that (1) the HeNe laser tube is from Zygo (!!), not
Melles Griot, and (2) it uses an Analog Control PCB with an LM353,
2 LM393s, and an LF347.  There are no microcontrollers, no NVRAM to get
erased, 2 pots to twiddle if needed, and all the ICs are socketed DIPs! :)
There is a temperature sensor glued to the laser tube, so it turns on the
feedback when the temperature exceeds a present value, rather than when
the mode cycle exceeds some length of time as with some other stabilized
HeNe lasers.  The temperature set-point pot is accessible via a hole in
the top of the rear plate (after the laser cover is removed), while the
mode balance pot is on the side.
<p>
An operation and service manual for a similar laser can be found at
<A HREF=
"http://laser.physics.sunysb.edu/~victor/info/Teletrac_laser.pdf">Teletrac
Stabilized Single Frequency Long HeNe Laser</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/Teletrac_laser.pdf">Sam's
Backup of Teletrac Stabilized Single Frequency Long HeNe Laser</A>.
It isn't quite identical though as the output of the laser in the manual is
linearly polarized at 45 degrees, while this one is circularly polarized.
<p>
With the separate temperature sensor and likely different heater
resistance and thermal response, the Axsys and Teletrac controllers
are not interchangeable, and fortunately for those wanting to try,
the connectors differ sufficiently to make it difficult (though not
impossible!) to do something bad in the process.
<p>
Naturally, since this version is emminently repairable, there would be
nothing seriously wrong with the sample I acquired.  It only had a
smashed on/off switch and polarizer with excessive scatter!
The tube is like new - instant start, stable run, locks
in 15 minutes or so, and well aligned producing over 3.2 mW total out the
beam expander in both circularly polarized modes since I never actually
replaced the polarizing filter.
<p>
That lock time of 15 minutes is somewhat longer than for the Axsys equipvalent,
probably due to the fact that the thin film heater occupies a very small
portion of the Zygo tube (less than 2 inches) compared to most of its length
for Melles Griot tube.  However, I bet the life expectancy of the Zygo tube,
typically 50,000 hours, is more than double that of the one from Melles Griot.
<p>
Why do manufacturers redesign a perfectly functional easy to manufacture
low cost PCB for no obvious reason other than to make it more proprietary?
This is the third example in this chapter alone (Agilent and Zygo being
the others I've seen so far).  There's no evidence that the digital controller
has any benefits in terms of specifications since they haven't changed.  It
would be hard to believe that it is cheaper to manufacture or test.  But
there is no doubt that it is more difficult or impossible for anyone other
than the original manufacture to repair or adjust!

<h3><A NAME="hsttrac3">Teletrac Model 150 Stabilized HeNe Laser 3</A></h3>

I thought I had seen all versions of the Teletrac 150, but this is yet
another.  It may have been at least in part an OEM special, but is probably
largely a standard model.  It is in a somewhat shorter case and            
uses what looks like a 6" Melles Griot barcode scanner tube with
anode-end output.  Like the its big brother described in the previous
section, there is a small thin-film heater and temperature sensor glued
to the tube.  At first I thought that only a single polarized mode is
used for feedback since there were only two wires coming from the
compact beam sampler, so it would be strictly intensity stabilized.  However,
it actually has two photodiodes - one for each polarized mode - in
parallel with opposite polarity like I use in my stabilized lasers.
The controller is a variation on the analog version with the same
two pots for the temperature set-point and mode balance.  The output
beam is a single linearly polarized mode (which corresponds to the green
mode LED during warmup), not the circularly polarized mode of the
other Teletrac and Axsys 150 lasers.
<p>
An operation and service manual for a similar laser can be found at
<A HREF=
"http://laser.physics.sunysb.edu/~victor/info/Teletrac_laser.pdf">Teletrac
Stabilized Single Frequency Long HeNe Laser</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laser/Teletrac_laser.pdf">Sam's
Backup of Teletrac Stabilized Single Frequency Long HeNe Laser</A>.
However this laser is probably the "Short" version since (1), it IS short, and
(2) the spec'd output power has to be much lower due to the much smaller HeNe
laser tube it uses.
<p>
The reason I think this was an OEM special is that the beam exits out a large
hole in the side of the case via a 45 degree mirror on an adjustable mount.
However, the front plate is clearly original but has no aperture, so this
was almost certainly done by Teletrac, not and end user.
The approximate arrangement of components is shown in
<A HREF="tt150p1.jpg">Teletrac 150 Laser and Optics</A>.  From left to right:
Teletrac 150 laser (version 2) with right angle output, optical receiver,
linear interferometer optics, and retroreflector on rotary mount.  The 4
holes in the top of the optical receiver are for the four (4) adjustment
pots.  The linear interferometer is basically a miniature version of the
HP/Zygo units.  The retroreflector is a cut-off cube-corner RTV'd into
a bracket that clamps to a ball bearing shaft.  See
<A HREF="tt150rr1.jpg">Teletrac Retroreflector on Rotary Mount</A> for
a closeup.  So, the total travel would have only been a few cm.
<p>
The principle of operation for a positioning system using this laser
would be similar to that of one using the HP/Agilent or Zygo lasers
found elsewhere in this chapter.
However, it is what's known as a "homodyne" system since it uses baseband
fringes, rather than the "heterodyne" system using the difference (split)
frequency of the two-frequency laser.
The general approach is shown in <A HREF="inter1f.gif">Interferometer
Using Single Frequency HeNe Laser</A>.
The linear interferometer is placed between the laser and the
retroreflector on the remote "tool".  The optical receiver goes
between the laser and the interferometer.  It has a single
aperture on its input (from the laser) side and a pair of apertures on
its output (from the interferometer) side, so it intercepts the return
beam but passes the outgoing beam unaffected.  (The only reason for
both beams to pass through the optical
receiver is one of practicality - the beams and spacing between the
two beams is about half what it is with the HP/Agilent or Zygo systems.)
But here there is only one frequency, so the measurement is based on
simple fringe analysis looking at fringes in quadrature to determine
position change and direction.  The beam enters the linear interferometer
polarized at a 45 degree angle with part (polarized vertically) being reflected
via the attached "reference" retroreflector back to the laser.  This is called
the reference beam or REF.  The rest (polarized horizontally) goes through
to be bounced off of the remote "tool" retroreflector.  This is called the
measurement beam or MEAS.  The linear interferometer combines the two return
beams and passes them to the optical receiver.  (REF and MEAS should not be
confused with signals of the same names used in the heterodyne systems.)
<p>
The optical receiver module contains a non-polarizing beam-splitter in the
path of the combined return beam feeding a pair of photodiodes.  Each PD has a
polarizer in front of it but one PD also has a 1/4 waveplate before the
polarizer that shifts the relative phase between REF and MEAS for its PD
by 90 degrees.  The outputs of the PDs thus vary sinusoidally with respect
to the relative phase of REF and MEAS.  These are the "cos"
and "sin" (quadrature) signals required
to sense both position change and direction.
So, in the same way that a rotary encoder creates quadrature
sin and cos outputs, the optical receiver produces similar signals as a
function of position (or more accurately, displacement or change in position).
This raw quadrature output is what is often needed to interface to a generic
machine tool's processor, which then does conversion to whatever units
are required.  A third photodiode labeled "Intensity" is also present which
is insensitive to phase and is used to compensate for the change in laser
power over time.
<p>
The optical receiver electronics consists of an LF353 (dual op-amp,
but only one section is used) and a pair of LM6361s (single op-amps)
with only a couple hand-fulls of discrete parts.  See
<A HREF="tt150or1.jpg">Teletrac 150 Optical Receiver 1 Assembly</A>
and <A HREF="ttor1sch.pdf">Teletrac 150 Optical Receiver 1 Schematic</A>.  The
back of one photodiode can be seen under the PCB.  The PD/beam-splitter
assembly is similar to the one in the Teletrac laser which included an
built-in optical receiver, in section:
<A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsttrac1">Teletrac Stabilized HeNe Laser 1</A>.
The LM6361s are preamps for the sin and cos PDs.  There
are 4 externally accessible pots to adjust!  Those for the cos
channel are labeled "H Gain" and "H Offset" and those for the sin
channel are labeled "V Gain and "V Offset".  Perhaps the H and V refer
to the polarization orientation of the PDs but that doesn't make a lot
of sense since I would expect those to be oriented at +45 and/or -45
degrees with respect to the base.  And why didn't they simply stick
with sin and cos!  The LF353 op-amp is the preamp for the Intensity
PD.  Its output is the reference voltage for the offset pots and is
thus in effect multiplied by the offset pot settings to shift the DC
output levels.  That reference voltage also goes to the cable, along
with the sin and cos (or V and H!) outputs.
<p>
The tube in my sample started sputtering shortly after power-on, but the Power
Technology HeNe laser power supply brick has a current adjustment pot, so
a quarter turn clockwise and presto! - no more sputtering.  The tube is clearly
high mileage with some unsightly brown bore crud and is perhaps somewhat
lower in power than when new (around 0.6 mW or 600 uW peak out of the beam
expander), but still starts instantly and locks just fine with a locked
output of around 300 uW.  For a single axis, the relatively low output
power of 300 uW (compared to other garden-variety stabilized HeNe lasers)
would be more than adequate.  In fact, most HP/Agilent lasers have a
minimum output power spec of 180 uW or less and they support multiple axes.
But more power would be necessary with the homodyne system.
<p>
The laser came with a bunch of other components including a compact linear
interferometer (a polarizing beam-splitter with attached retroreflector),
a remote retroreflector on a ball-bearing mount, and an optical
receiver for the return beam.  (The linear interferometer is the same size
as the HP/Agilent single beam interferometer, but with a slightly larger
aperture.)  All this may have been part of the angular positioning servo
for a hard drive or CD/DVD mastering system.  A basic system like this
would probably be adequate for such an application due to the relatively short
travel (a few cm or less).

<h2>Zygo Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.zygo.com/">Zygo</A>
is a manufacturer of a variety of precision photonics including a
number of different types of stabilized HeNe lasers.
See <A HREF="http://www.zygo.com/?/met/markets/stageposition/zmi/laserheads/">
Zygo Laser Heads</A>.  Most use dual polarization mode stabilization
techniques with varying levels of noise and drift.
<p>
All models use HeNe laser tubes of conventional design that are custom
made by Zygo, along with an external heater for cavity length control.
Their 7705 is a Zeeman-split two-frequency laser with specifications similar
to those of the HP/Agilent 5517D, but uses a very short HeNe laser
tube with a total length of around 4 inches.
The 7701 and 7702 are dual mode polarization stabilized lasers based on
9 to 10 inch long tubes similar to those in laboratory frequency
and/or intensity stabilized
single frequency lasers like the Spectra-Physics 117A (as well as many common
unstabilized HeNe lasers).  (The 7701
used Aerotech laser tubes at some point in the past though.)  These
lasers utilize an Acouto-Optic Modulator (AOM) rather than Zeeman splitting
to generate a second component 20 MHz away.  The split or REF frequency for
all Zygo lasers <i>except</i> the 7705 is thus 20 MHz, which is crystal
controlled rather than somewhat random. :)  The 7712/14/22/24 lasers use
similar methods for stabilization and generation of the split frequency,
but with more sophisticated techniques to
minimize the effects of back-reflections by shifting
the frequency of any return beams away from the lasing line.
They also have better specifications for stability (probably because
they are water-cooled rather than air-cooled) and produce
higher power by more fully utilizing one (7712/14) or both (7722/24)
lasing modes.  The 7722/24 are fiber-coupled with a remotely
located "delivery module".

companion document: <A HREF="zymleval.htm">Considerations in Evaluating
Used or Rebuilt Zygo Metrology Lasers</A>.

<h3><A NAME="hstzyl05">Zygo 7705 Two-Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 7705 is used in the same types of applications as the Hewlett Packard
(now Agilent) 5517D and has similar specifications.  It is also a Zeeman
laser but is based on a HeNe laser tube of conventional design custom
made by Zygo.  The HeNe laser tube is possibly the shortest one found
in any commercial product, with an overall length of around 4 inches (10 cm).
This small size - actually the short distance between the mirrors -
is necessary to prevent the generation of rogue longitudinal
modes when the neon gain curve is split and thus effectively widened by the
Zeeman magnetic field.  It also means that the maximum output power is severely
limited, though still apparently quite adequate with a spec'd value of
250 &micro;W for the normal version (-03) and 350 &micro;W for the high
power version (-04).  These are actually similar to those of the
HP/Agilent-5517D with its somewhat longer tube.  The split/REF frequency
is spec'd to be between 3.3 and 3.9 MHz, nearly the same as the 5517D at 3.4
to 4 MHz.

<h3><A NAME="hstzyl02">Zygo 7701/7702 Two-Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 7701 and very similar 7702 are used in the same types of applications
as the Hewlett Packard (now Agilent) 5501A/B, 5517, and others.  It produces
a beam with a pair of orthogonal polarized modes with a frequency offset
between them.  For the 7701 and 7702, the offset is 20 MHz, set by a crystal
reference.  Unlike the HP lasers which use an axial Zeeman split technique
with a difference frequency that is somewhat arbitrary, the Zygo lasers employ
a HeNe laser tube of conventional design, though they are now custom made by
or for Zygo and claim a typical lifetime of 50,000 hours.  A typical
sample is shown in <A HREF="zygtube1.jpg">Custom Zygo HeNe Laser Tube Used In
ZMI 77XX Lasers</A>.  However, the tubes
used in really old Zygo 7701 lasers may be standard models from Aerotech such
as the OEM2R.  Only a single polarized mode oriented at 45 degrees actually
exits the laser tube assembly and ends up producing the output in the 7701 or
7702, though the usual two orthogonally polarized modes are used for
stabilization.  (Thus for the 7701/7702 lasers, half the output power
of the laser tube is thrown away.)  An external Acousto-Optic Modulator (AOM)
"creates" polarized modes aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes,
with the vertical mode shifted in frequency by 20 MHz with respect to the
horizontal mode as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The output of the HeNe laser tube consists of two orthogonal polarized
 modes oriented at +/-45 degrees.
<p>
<li>One of these modes is totally blocked by the beam sampler optics at the
 output of the tube and is only used by the stabilization electronics.
<p>
<li>A small portion of the other mode is split off
 for use by the stabilization electronics, while the remainder exits the
 tube assembly and goes to the AOM.
<p>
<li>The AOM uses a birefringent crystal that splits the single mode oriented
 at 45 degrees into a horizontal (ordinary) component and vertical
 (extra-ordinary) component.
<p>
<li>With no drive to the AOM, the horizontal component is passed to the
 output of the laser unchanged while the vertical component is blocked.
<p>
<li>With the AOM driven by a 20 MHz signal, the vertical component is split
 into upper and lower sidebands offset 20 MHz from the original optical
 frequency. One of these is passed to the output of the laser and its
 optical power is proportional to drive voltage.
<p>
<li>The optical power of the horizontal component that is output from the laser
 is reduced as well in proportion to the AOM drive voltage.
<p>
<li>Thus, with no AOM drive and only the horizontal component present,
 the output power of the laser is 25 to 50 percent greater than the
 <i>total</i> power with the AOM producing the orthogonal components with
 equal output power.
<p>
<li>In the end, the total output power of a 7701 or 7702
 laser is less than 1/4 of that from the bare tube.  Somewhat over
 half is lost in the beam sampler (which blocks one of the modes totally)
 and the remainder is lost in the AOM and its associated optics.  Nonetheless,
 the output power from a new laser may exceed 750 &micro;W.
</ul>
<p>
This scheme is more complex in terms of external optics and electronics
than the Zeeman lasers, but doesn't require a special expensive tube
assembly.  Moreover, it allows for a larger difference frequency (and thus
higher measurement speed) and precise control of its actual value
and quality in terms of jitter/phase noise (which
permits higher measurement precision, or so Zygo claims).
Zeeman techniques are limited to a maximum
of about 3 to 4 MHz easily, perhaps 8 or 9 MHz with difficulty.
And the exact frequency is determined by physical
characteristics of the laser tube and strength of the magnetic field,
(and stray magnetic fields from other equipment), as well as the age
of the tube - parameters that are hard to control precisely.  (However,
note, that the the exact value of the difference frequency is not
critical only affecting the maximum rate of change of position that
can be measured.  And slow drift of the difference frequency is
generally of no consequence since measurements are based on the
<i>difference</i> between the two difference frequencies - the
reference and the return beam from the item that moves.)
But the 20 MHz reference frequency means that the rate of position change
can be 5 times or more greater for the Zygo system than for most of the
HP/Agilent systems, though at the possible expense of higher speed electronics.
But the signal processing can take advantage of the precise crystal
controlled reference, something not possible if it can vary 100 percent
or more as with HP/Agilent systems depending on the type of laser head
is used.
<p>
However, one consequence of this scheme is that the optics are more
critical.  While the two frequency components of a Zeeman laser are
inherently precisely co-linear, this is not true with the AOM
implementation.  Careful optical design, fabrication, and alignment
are needed to assure co-linearity for the Zygo lasers.  A prism
following the AOM diverts the desired horizontal and vertical
components such that they appear to originate from a common point and
thus will be co-linear following the output beam expander telescope.
Errors can be quite evident in a laser whose alignment has shifted
or when adjusting the orientation of the AOM for optimal performance.
Although the horizontally and vertically polarized components won't
actually shoot off in different directions, their central peak will
vary in location across the overall beam profile.

The guts of a typical Zygo 7701 laser are shown in
<A HREF="zy7701p1.jpg">Interior of Zygo 7701 Stabilized HeNe Laser</A>.
A Power Technology HeNe laser power supply brick drives the Zygo laser tube
which is in a metal enclosure (lower right).  A resistance heater consisting
of a bifilar-wound copper wire coil surrounds tube as shown in
<A HREF="zygtube2.jpg">Zygo HeNe Laser Tube with Bifiler-Wound Heater</A>.
Some Zygo lasers use a thin-film heater as shown in
<A HREF="zygtube3.jpg">Zygo HeNe Laser Tube with Thin-Film Heater</A>
but I do not know if any 7701s or 7702s use this approach, which would
clearly be much less labor-intensive, though the parts cost would be
greater.  The heater is used in a conventional feedback loop to control
the cavity length based on the usual mode balance of two adjacent
orhtogonally polarized longitudinal modes with warmup and time-to-lock
taking about 10 minutes. The output of the HeNe laser tube feeds
the mode detector optics inside the dark gray thing with the photodiodes
mounted on the angled circuit board.  One of the two polarized modes is
blocked by a filter at its output.  The remaining mode, oriented at
a 45 degree angle, enters the AOM, which is a birefringent crystal slab.
This splits the angled beam into two parts.  With no RF applied to the AOM,
all of the power that exits the laser comes from the ordinary ray, which is
horizontally polarized.  The output power in the vertically polarized beam
shifted 20 MHz in optical frequency from the horizontally polarized beam
comes from the extra-ordinary ray and is proportional to the RF power applied
to the AOM.  This also subracts some power from the ordinary ray, so the
total output power from the laser is lower with the AOM driven, by about
25 percent when the H and V components are equal.
<p>
The beams then pass through a prism, reflect off the two bounce mirrors, and
then through a mystery optic - possibly a spatial filter/selector to pass
only the horizontally polarized beam and the single desired 20 MHz offset
vertically polarized beam.  (Older versions of the 7701/2 lack this
optic though its mounting holes may be present in some cases)
so it's apparently not totally essential but was prehaps added to
remove vestiges of the unused sideband of the vertical mode as
well as hormonics resulting from the squarewave drive of the AOM.)
The output is expanded/collimated to a diameter of either 3 or 6 mm
depending on the specific version.  The output shutter provides for
the full diameter beam, blocked, or a small diameter beam for alignment.
<p>
<A HREF="zy7702l1.jpg">Left-Side View of Interior of Zygo 7702 Stabilized
HeNe Laser</A> and <A HREF="zy7702r1.jpg">Right-Side View of Interior of Zygo
7702 Stabilized HeNe Laser</A> show the substantially similar Zygo 7702.
The main difference between the 7701 and 7702 seems to be that the 7702 has
added a fiber-optic output connector for the 20 MHz reference while the older
7701 provides only a differential ECL electrical signal.  Internally, the
7702 has the AOM RF driver built into the Control PCB rather than a
separate module.
<p>
The 7702s (or at least all those I've seen including the one in the photos)
have a totally redesigned digital
Control PCB using a microcontroller for initialization and warmup, and only
switching to analog feedback for actual stabilization feedback.  This is
actually a rather sophisticated system, much more so than the HP/Agilent
lasers, at least those with the Analog Control PCB.  (And even those with
a digital Control PCB have no externally accessible communication ports.)
The status may be interrogated via an RS232 port, and with some firmware
revisions (or maybe there's a jumper to select this), the the controller
will report step-by-step what it's doing and any errors encountered.  There
must also be a way of setting parameters like temperature calibration and
output mode balance (AOM power), but this information is very tightly
controlled by Zygo.
<p>
The firmware starts out by measuring the tube heater resistance two or
three times to determine its temperature and whether it's in the steady
state (e.g., hasn't just been powered off as would be indicated by a
changing temperature).  If so, it waits a bit to gather more information.
Then, it computes the number of mode slews (what everyone else calls mode
cycles) to wait and turns the tube heater on full.  Since a single mode
slew corresponds to a known temperature change of the tube, this allows
the firmware to set the temperature of the tube to a presumably optimal
point.  Whether all this actually results in a laser with better performance
compared to HP/Agilent, or even a Coherent 200, might be debatable though. :)
<p>
There is also a fundamental shortcoming with respect to status in all of these
Zygo lasers: The OK LED and presense of the REF signal only means that the
system has locked successfully, NOT that both orthogonal polarized modes are
present or correct.  In fact, from the AOM to the output aperture, there is no
monitoring of any kind!  Thus, the AOM can be weak or dead, or have had
its drive cable unplugged, and the OK LED will still be lit, and the REF
signals will still be present.  There could be an actual bug in the beam path
resulting in no output power at all and the system would not know. :)
The HP/Agilent lasers at least derive the REF signal from the output
beam and require a minimum level to turn on READY solid.  This is
nearly always a sufficient indication of correct operation.
<p>
Unfortunately, while it's possible to swap controller PCBs and usually
get a combination that will lock, the mode balance is typically way off
(set by the AOM power) and the temperature calibration is also messed
up (which may or may not really matter).  But, one can't claim these
meet Zygo specs like the HP/Agilent which have no adjustments except
of the temperature set-point.
<p>
Another similar issue may be related to laser tube power and/or beam
sampler photodiode sensitivity.  To check the electrical signal from
the photodiodes, there is a test point on the controller PCB (it's
location varies depending on version).  This is a negative voltage
that ranges from 0 V (no light) to 10 V (amplifier clipping).  It
would appear that the useful range is from about 5 V to 9 V.  If the
level goes above 10 V, the laser will probably not lock, or lose lock
after the tube warms up.  Where a combination of laser tube/beam sampler
and controller produces too high a signal level, it is possible to put
a neutral density filter inside the beam sampler housing just before
the photodiode ("Light Valve") PCB.  An angled plate would be best to
minimize back-reflections, but I simply stuffed a couple pieces of
thin plastic from some packaging in there, resulting in a 15 or 20 percent
reduction in the light hitting the photodiodes, and that worked fine.
I don't know how low a signal it will tolerate, nor whether there is any
sort of automatic gain control implemented in firmware.  It may be that
as long as the signal varies by some minimum percentage, the exact level
doesn't matter as long as it never exceed 10 V.  (The 7701s with analog
Control PCBs will still lock reliably with less than 100 &micro;W total power.)
<p>
So, a major disadvantage of the digital Control PCB for service
by someone without access to Zygo documentation and software is
that there is no way to adjust any parameters (there are no pots!) if
they are swapped.  While I have swapped Control PCBs in 7702s, it isn't
possible to get the mode balance to meet Zygo spec for the 7702 with
electronic adjustments (less than 5 percent difference between H and
V modes, but see below), or to change the
temperature calibration to accommodate slightly different tube heater
resistances.
<p>
Of course, it may be that the mode balance is actually set in some other
way, by the precise orientation of the laser tube, for example.  Swapping
AOMs doesn't seem to change it much, nor even swapping PCBs.  It seems
to be associated with the tube and chassis.  Where the vertical mode is
greater than the horizontal mode, it may be possible to add a small
resistor in series with the RF to the AOM, or a voltage divider before
the RF driver.  Or, in either case, adjusting the alignment of the AOM
very slightly may be able to balance the modes without affecting
the symmetry of the beam profile or total output power noticeably, if
at all.
<p>
One note about adjusting the AOM: I don't know if it's possible to get
the alignment so far off such that a sideband is passed to the output as the
horizontal mode rather than the vertical mode.  Assuming both polarizationed
modes were still present, the result would be
to change the sign in the measurement of position/velocity.  There is no
easy way to check for such an "oops" without testing in an interferometer.
Without one, this would require comparing the optical frequencies to a
reference laser.
<p>
And, speaking of swapping parts, my recommendation until more info magically
becomes available would be to avoid disturbing the HeNe laser tube, prism
following the AOM, mystery optic, and beam expander/collimator.  Very *small*
adjustments can be made to the turning mirrors to peak output power.
Everything else can be removed and replaced only requiring straightforward
realignment at most.  OK, so there isn't much else - the beam sampler
assembly and AOM! :)
<p>
I had a 7701C/E that was very weak - about 40 &micro;W out the end.  It still
locked reliably but this output power is well below minimum spec.  So, what I
did was to transplant its 7701C/e Control PCB and AOM into a 7702C/E that had a
good tube but bad Control PCB.  This turned out to be quite straightforward
with the only tricky part being aligning the AOM to maximize the vertical
polarized mode.  Everything including the bolt holes are the same so the
result is a like-new 7701C/E.
<p>
There were six 7702C/Es (all except ID #7) and that weak 7701C/E (ID #7)
as follows:

<p>
ID #4 was a 7702C/E, converted to a 7701C/E with organ transplants.
IDs #5 and #6 aren't useful for measurement, but are decent stabilized
lasers.  If the AOM and mystery optic were totally removed, the output
power would be between 1.5 and 2 mW in a single mode.  Since ID #7 is
not useful in its present condition, I may attempt to install a good
Zygo tube just for kicks.  IDs #1 to #4 all have excellent output power
and acceptable mode balance.  They appear to meet Zygo specifications,
though I do not have enough information to be absolutely positive.

<h4><A NAME="hstzyl02p">Zygo 7701/7702 Connector Pinout</A></h4>

A DB25F connector on the back of the laser head is used for DC power,
REF, status signals (UNSTABLE and SERVICE), and RS232 communications.
The 7702 has a fiber connector for an additional optical REF signal output
that the 7701 lacks.  Note that DB25F is not a typo - it is a female
connector on the laser and a male connector from the power supply.
<p>
The following is from the operation manuals for the 7701 and 7702.
Everything on the DB25F is the same:

<h4><A NAME="hstzyl02c">RS232 Communications with Zygo 7702 Lasers</A></h4>

(This may also apply to later versions of the 7701 laser using a digital
Control PCB.)
<p>
Settings: 9600 baud, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity, XON/XOF,
half duplex.
<p>
All commands consist of 3 decimal digits terminated by a Carriage
Return (CR) character.  Any other characters or improper format will
return an E01 "Unrecognized Command" error.
<p>
There are 7 commands documented in the Zygo 7702 operation manual:
<p>
<b>Command 100 - Report System Status</b>
<p>
This command returns a code (usually
2 digits) that indicates the state of the firmware during system
initialization until locked, or if an error is encountered.  The valid
codes are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>0: Manual control.  The laser head enters this state if a hardware
 failure is detected.  It is also used during factory setup and testing.
<li>1: Wait for laser tube to turn on.
<li>2: Power-on Startup.
<li>4: Wait for initial A/D values to be read.
<li>5: First heater wire resistance reading.
<li>10: 15 second delay after first heater wire resistance reading.
<li>15: Second heater wire resistance reading.
<li>20: 15 second delay after second heater wire resistance reading.
<li>25: Third heater wire resistance reading.
<li>30: Delay 2 minutes while the heater wire temperature cools to
 the laser tube temperature.
<li>35: Warmup state.  The heater is on full and the microcontroller
 is tracking mode slews.  (What everyone else calls mode cycles!)
<li>40: Heater control switched to analog mode.  Wait one minute until
 analog controller locks.
<li>45: Laser head is stable.  Reference signals are enabled.  This is
 the normal operational state.
<li>50: Instability detected after state 45.  Reference signals disabled.
 10 millisecond pause to permit the error condition to propagate through
 the user's system.
<li>55: Monitoring checking.  Wait for up to 2 minutes for mode slewing.
 If mode slewing stops (indicating that the system is again stable), go
 back to state 45.  If mode slewing continues, then go to state 60.
<li>60: Instability condition exists.  Turn off the heater.  Wait for
 tube temperature to cool to 95 &deg;C then go to state 65.  If mode
 slewing stops, go to state 45.
<li>65: Instability condition exists.  Turn on the heater.  Wait for
 tube temperature to rise to 105 &deg;C then go to state 60.  If mode
 slewing stops, go to state 45.
</ul>
<p>
It's not clear from this list of states, when the "Service" LED is
turned on.  However, from monitoring states continuously with firmware
that constantly sends status to the RS232 port, it seems that going
to state 0 does not turn on the "Service" LED even though it's going
to be trapped there and never re-acquire lock.
<p>
<b>Command 101 - Report All Errors</b>
<p>
This command reports the contents of the error log.
<p>
As errors are encountered, the firmware enters them into an error log.
The possible error codes are shown below:
<p>
<ul>
<li>E00: Unknown error.
<li>E05: EEPROM failed to verify.
<li>E07: Unknown heater override command type.
<li>E08: A/D (value) too large for calibration. 
<li>E09: A/D (value) too small for calibration. 
<li>E10: EEPROM clock error.
<li>E11: A/D failed to convert in time.
<li>E12: Heater wire resistance too high.
<li>E13: Heater wire resistance too low.
<li>E14: Mode slewing not fast enough.
<li>E15: Mode slewing too fast.
<li>E16: Heater is stuck on.
<li>E17: Heater is stuck off.
<li>E18: A/D read back did not verify.
<li>E19: EEPROM checksum failed at startup.
<li>E20: Laser output power too low.:
<li>E21: Wavelength unstable
<li>E22: Laser tube did not turn on after 70 seconds.
<li>E23: Program checksum failed to verify.
</ul>
<p>
A "G" follows the last error sent, and the error log is cleared.
Duplicate consecutive errors are recorded only once.  If there are
no errors, the response is only a "G".
<p>
The following RS232 port (user) errors are NOT recorded in the error log:
<p>
<ul>
<li>E01: Command not recognized.
<li>E02: Privileged mode not enabled.
<li>E03: Incorrect number of parameters entered.
<li>E04: Parameter out of range.
<li>E06: Incorrect password for privileged mode.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Command 102 - Report Laser Head Serial Number</b>
<p>
This command returns a text string corresponding to the laser head
serial printed on the nameplate.  So, in essence, this is really a
Control PCB serial number. :)
<p>
<b>Command 103 - Report PCB Firmware Version</b>
<p>
This command returns a text string corresponding to the laser head
firmware revision.
<p>
<b>Command 104 - Report Laser Tube Total Hours</b>
<p>
This command reports the total laser tube power on hours.  Presumably,
if a tube is replaced, this can be reset to 0.
<p>
<b>Command 105 - Report Heater Control Status</b>
<p>
This command reports the heater control state as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unknown heater control.
<li>Heater is off.
<li>Heater is on full.
<li>Heater is controlled by the analog controller.
</ol>
<p>
Note: the values for heater on and off are interchanged in the manual.
<p>
<b>112 - Report Output Power</b> 
<p>
This command reports the laser head output power in microwatts (&micro;W).
<p>
Well, sort of. :)  The integer value *is* proportional to the output
power but the typical values returned are closer to 1/2 the output
power, and even then, tend to be low by 30 percent or more.

<h4><A NAME="hstzyl02m">RS232 Status Readout of Several 7702 Lasers</A></h4>

Here are data for 5 Zygo 7702C/E lasers.  The first 3 are healthy while
the last two have weak AOM drive.  It is not known if this is due to a faulty
component or corrupted EEPROM.  Codes 100-105, and 112 correspond to
the user commands documented above and in the Zygo operation manual.
The others were found by an exhaustive search starting at 100 and going
up until only EO1s were returned.  I have not tested all 1,000 possible
3 digit commands though. :)  The full serial numbers have been suppressed
to protect the guilty, but the firmware revisions are listed. :-)

<p>
Note Code 124: It returns E03, which means that a parameter is missing.
I tried a select number of possible values.  It seems to want a 4 digit
number so as not to generate an error.  4 digit numbers returned
mostly a 0, but sometimes some other 1 or 2 Hex number.  But never
anything particularly enlightening.  Also note that one controller
has its EEPROM unlocked, whatever that means.
<p>
One firmware revision, V01.15a, produces a running commentary (see the next
section) on exactly what it is doing, and counting off mode slews.  I didn't
see anything different on the PCB with this
firmware compared with the others, including no obvious jumper settings,
so I don't know if it's simply a feature (or bug) associated with V01.15a.
I did try changing jumpers with no positive results.  Removing the jumpers
that were already present (1 at a time) only resulted in the controller
not responding to the RS232 port at all, and probably not doing anything
else either.  Then there was that one that did really bad things.  (More
below.)

Here is another older laser, probably one of the first with the Digital
Control PCB:

<p>
If that "Head PCB Hrs" of 51775 applies to the original tube as well, that
would be impressive as the tube behaves nearly like new.
<p>
CAUTION: Don't try installing jumpers at random on Zygo Digital Control
PCBs.  There is a set of posts
that *looks* like a location for a 2 pin jumper, but is actually a
pair of test points for power (+5 VDC and +15 VDC) with no current
limiting resistors!  Guess what happens if
you install a jumper there? :( :)  Don't ask how I found out!
At least it was a unit that had other problems and has now
been put out of its misery, but it still hurts.
I wonder how may Control PCBs have been ruined by Zygo field service techs
accidentally installing a jumper in the wrong place!  Stupid PCB layout.
Or perhaps intentional? ;-) 

<h4><A NAME="hstzyl02l">Typical Zygo 7702 Firmware Log</A></h4>

Here are complete logs of initialization from a cold start, and then
from being powered off for about 1 minute.  The firmware is
version 1.15a, which is the only one of those I've
tested to default to chatty mode. :)  The temperatures reported are
somewhat bogus, probably because this Control PCB (#4) was swapped
into a different case/tube (#2) without recalibration
with respect to tube heater resistance (procedure unknown).

<h3><A NAME="hstzyl12">Zygo 7712/7714 Two-Frequency HeNe Laser</A></h3>

The 7712 (and similar 7714 that has replaced it) with free-space beam
delivery like the 7702, and the functionally
similar 7722/24 with fiber-coupled delivery are the "flagships" of the Zygo
series of ZMI metrology lasers.  Their stability is spec'd to be about
4 times better than the 7702, and the available output power is approximately
double that of the 7702.  (The 7722/24 has a separate "Fiber Delivery Module"
with 2 separate fiber outputs, each with double the power of the 7702, so 4
times greater total available power.)  They are water, rather than air-cooled,
which probably accounts for much of the improved stability, being essentially
immune to changes in ambient temperature.  But they also include internal
optical isolation to reduce the effects of back-reflections on stability.
<p>
The 7712/14 is in a much fancier case than the 7702 with ball joints for
mounting - change every 50K miles. :)  It may be better environmentally
sealed than the 7702.  The DB25 connector, the cable power and signal wiring
is compatible with that of the 7701/02.  I have not seen the inside
of a 7712/14 as yet though.  It has the same fiber connector for the REF
signal as on the 7702, as well as additional fiber connectors
labeled "Sync", purpose unknown.  And there are the
water connections which appear to be 1/8" NPT female fittings.

Note that the "Laser State", Code 100, is slightly different for the
7712 compared to the 7702.  On the 7702, it is 45 for the locked
condition.  On the 7712, it is 50.  The intermediate codes also
differ.

<h3><A NAME="hstzylpzl">Problems With Zygo 77XX Lasers</A></h3>

Here are some common faults and remedies (where possible) for all Zygo
lasers using an AOM to split the output into a pair of optical frequency
components separated by 20 MHz.  Except for basic laser tube/power supply
problems, these do not apply to the 7705, which is an axial Zeeman
HeNe lasers and is of quite different construction.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tube does not start:</b> These lasers use a laser tube currently
 made by or for Zygo, but of conventional design.  It is powered by a
 Power Technology brick running of the 15 VDC input directly.  Healthy
 tubes usually start instantly or at least within a few seconds.  The
 Zygo software allows something like a minute for a beam to appear before
 declaring an error.  However, if the tube truly fails to start,
 troubleshoot starting with the DC power input.
<p>
<li><b>Tube flickers or sputters:</b> Assuming the DC power is within
 spec and the HeNe laser power supply is working correctly, this could
 be due to the dropout current for the HeNe laser tube increasing with
 use.  Replacement with a HeNe laser power supply capable of providing
 0.5 to 1 mA more current may work.  (The default current is 5 mA but
 is not adjustable.)
<p>
<li><b>Low output power:</b> High mileage HeNe laser tubes decline in
 power until they are a shadow of their former selves.  I've seen Zygo
 lasers that were outputting only 30 &micro;W with the tube itself putting out
 around 100 &micro;W, yet the laser locked successfully.  The minimum spec
 for a 7701 laser is 400 &micro;W.  The only remedy is a tube replacement.
<p>
<li><b>Little or no vertical polarized Mode:</b> If the horizontally polarized
 component of the beam (which comes directly from the laser tube) is normal -
 decent power and beam profile, then there is a problem with the AOM or its
 drive.  The vertical component is generated by the AOM and is offset from
 it by 20 MHz.  Where there is little or no vertically polarized beam power,
 the AOM is either misaligned, the drive to it is low or missing, or it
 is faulty.  Drive problems may be due
 to either an electronic failure of the AOM driver, or in the case of the
 digital control PCB, possibly a corrupt EEPROM value
resulting in too low a drive voltage.  (This latter has not been
 confirmed - there is an EEPROM entry that tracks the AOM drive voltage,
 but I don't know if it is a measured value, or specifies the drive
 voltage.)  For the Analog Control PCB, the AOM driver is a separate
 module.  Checking the 20 MHz drive with an oscilloscope will easily
 show if the voltage is too weak.  I'm not sure what the typical range is
 but less than a few volts is definitely a problem.
<p>
 If the drive is strong, then either the AOM crystal (or the electrical
 connection to it) is bad (this is unlikely), or it is misaligned.  Loosen
 the two hex screws holding the AOM in place and carefully move it back and
 forth and adjust its orientation while monitoring the vertically polarized
 output (or preferably, both outputs).  If there is a position where the H
 and V output power can be made approximately equal, someone before you
 may have been inside this laser!  The alignment generally won't change
 on its own.
<p>
<li><b>Large mode imbalance:</b> This is a milder case of the previous
 malady and will have basically the same cause.
<p>
<li><b>Does not lock or loses lock and Service LED comes on:</b> The normal
 time to lock for Zygo lasers is 10 to 15 minutes.  If locking is unsuccessful
 or lock is lost after this for any reason, the Service LED will come on and
 the heater should be turned off.  There is a test-point on the control PCB
 with a voltage that should swing typically in the range 4 to 10 V, but no
 more than 10 V.  (TP to be identified.)  If the voltage on the test-point
 is not moving, or is pegged too high, then lock will not be achieved.  And if
 the output of the tube increases substantially with warmup *after* locking,
 it may go out of range and lose lock.
<p>
<li><b>Strong beam from tube but low or no output from laser:</b> Most likely,
 someone has messed with the tube alignment and/or attempted to remove and
 replace the tube without realignment.  Good luck. :) 
<p>
<li><b>Infrequent mode flips or other transient errors:</b> One known cause
 is noisy DC input power, but some of these glitches may occur even when
 run on a power conditioner and Sola constant voltage transformer inside
 a Faraday cage in a lead-lined room. :)
 So, the laser may have a tube that's borderline stable
 (mode-flipping-wise), have stick-slip noise from its mounting or the
 use of a non-Zygo tube, have bad electrical connections or marginal
 components, or there may be aliens attempting to communicate with Earth. :)
 These events may occur only once in several hours, so locating the cause can
 be a challenge.  Assuming power problems have been ruled out, the only
 viable troubleshooting technique may be to swap in subsystems one at a time
 from a known working similar laser and retest until the problem
 disappears.  If the tube itself is the problem, the easiest solution may be a
 body transplant.  However, observing the exact nature of the glitch
 can help to narrow it down to the tube, mounting, or electronics.  It may
 be possible to single out the tube by running it from
 a separate HeNe laser power supply and cable with the
 controller disconnected.  Mode
 flips will then be very obvious and easily distinguished
 from the tube entirely dropping out momentarily.  However, a null result
 doesn't prove the tube is good since it's not running as hot as when
 locked normally.
<p>
 These are among the hardest faults to track down, and may have no
 solution other than a replacement tube or laser.  They tend to occur
 on high-mileage tubes but not aways.  And, the output power and all
 other characteristics may be perfectly acceptable.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Half cycle dip (both H and V) lasting a few seconds:</b> The tube
 is mode flipping due to some a momentary dropout, some change with age
 resulting in instability, or back-reflections.  It then re-acquires lock.
<p>
<li><b>Full cycle glitch (both H and V) lasting a few seconds:</b> Losing lock
 and re-acquiring.  If it is only a one-time event, something is intermittent
 in the locking electronics, or could also be caused by strong
 back-reflections.  If it continues repetitively, then the temperature
 set-point may be too low or too high, or the mode amplitude from the
 beam sampler may be too large and saturating the preamp.
<p>
<li><b>Dip (both H and V) lasting a fraction of a second:</b> The tube is going
 out and restarting due to its dropout current being too close to the
 operating current, bad connections in the wiring or inside the tube,
 or the HeNe laser power supply is faulty.
<p>
<li><b>Dip in V with corresponding bump in H:</b> The AOM, wiring, or AOM
 driver are intermittently resulting in lower drive voltage to the AOM.
 The opposite is also possible, though probably a lot less likely.
</ul>
<p>
 Now to elaborate further on one set of behaviors that seems most common:
<p>
 As noted on some lasers, the output power will drop (probably to
 zero) for a few milliseconds and then recover, possibly
 resulting in a mode flip.  If there is no mode flip, then the output
 power will return to exactly where it was before the dropout.  If
 there is a mode flip, the stabilization feedback will result in a
 slow (over a few seconds) reduction in output power and then recovery
 as it relocks the modes.
<p>
 These events may not cause a change in the the Status LEDs on the back
 of the laser or even be detected and flagged as errors by the firmware,
 but they should be caught by the Zygo data processor.  In principle, any
 measurement/motion that was in progress could be aborted and redone without
 position error, though I don't know if that's what is done.
<p>
 The time from one dropout to the next can be many hours so the only real
 way to detect this behavior is to run the laser on a data acquisition system
 that monitors the laser output power.  Such a run is shown in
 <A HREF="zylrdmf1.gif">Random Dropouts and Mode-Flips in a High Mileage
 Zygo HeNe Laser</A>.  This shows one polarized mode of a Zygo 7701 laser
 tube powered using an external HeNe laser lab power supply with nothing either
 active, so there is no stabilization and thus there is normal mode sweep.
 The dropouts have a duration of less than 1/30th
 of a second, though exactly how short they are is unclear due to the
 data acquisition sampling rate and input filtering.  My guess is
 a few milliseconds.  When a dropout occurs, there is a 50/50 chance
 that it will induce a mode-flip.  Without stabilization, this
 results in a sudden change in output power.  When the laser is locked
 with approximately equal power in both modes, there is no sudded change
 in power (or only a very small one), but then the laser relocks by
 going through a 180 degree change in the modes as shown in
 <A HREF="zylrmfe1.gif">Zygo Laser Random Mode-Flip Event</A>.  This is
 basically the bottom half of the normal mode sweep that would be
 observed during warmup as in the previous plot - a dip of 20 or
 30 percent of the locked power with a duration of 10 or 20 seconds.
 Both polarized modes will do the same thing.
<p>
 In order to narrow down the cause of this behavior
 wtih one such laser, I plugged the +/-15 VDC power supply
 into a Sola constant voltage transformer on a surge suppressor
 with no noticeable change.  I also ran the laser tube using a
 separate HeNe laser power supply with nothing else in the laser
 powered (no stabilization) to eliminate the internal one and other
 circuitry in the laser as a cause and still got dropouts.  The AC
 power was also monitored with no evidence of corresponding spike,
 surges, brownouts, or other unsightly blemishes.  So, unless someone
 installed an MRI machine next door while I wasn't looking,
 The cause of the dropouts is almost certainly
 related to the HeNe laser tube or its immediate wiring (ballast resistor,
 etc.)  I'm now leaning toward a bad ballast resistor as being at least
 one of the possible causes.  These lasers have two ballast resistors.
 One is near the tube and another is further back along the HV wiring.
 Both are enclosed in a plactic cylinder and potted.  There is almost
 always evidence of stress in at least one of the resistors in used
 Zygo lasers - a rough and/or bulging outer surface. I found the
 ballast resistance of one 7702 laser that was having these spasms
 to be around 140K ohms, which seems
 rather high.  The ballast in a healthy laser measured 75K ohms, which is
 what would be expected.  Another one that had problems read 90K ohms.
 Now, 90K ohms might be normal as I've found that some Zygo tubes do
 prefer a somewhat higher value, but 140K seems to be off the charts.
 And I later found two lasers with ballast resistances of over 300K
 which is absolute nonsense.  So, these resistors degrade over time.
 They probably have the most deviation from a normal resistance when
 cold, but run with a resistance that is reasonable most of the time.
 However, the resistance spasms for want of a better term resulting
 in a tube dropout.  Unfortunately, there is no real way to dissect
 the potted ballast resistors.  So, even where the total resistance measures
 under 100K, the only test will be to replace both resistors and see if the
 problem disappears.  And it may be necessary to run the laser for several
 days on a continuously monitored setup that will catch even very short
 glitches to be sure.  The "Service" LED is generally not turned on by
 these events.
<p>
 However, even the new ballast resistors doesn't seem to cure all lasers.
 At this point, I am fairly convinced that there must be internal tube
 problems with some of them.  My wild guess would be that it has to do
 with contact between the cathode-end mirror mount and the thin film
 cathode deposited on the glass envelope.
<p>
<li><b>Service LED comes on immediately:</b> On the digital control PCB,
 this generally indicates an inability to initialize the firmware and is
 probably fatal unless you work for Zygo. :( :)
<p>
<li><b>Service LED comes on shortly after laser starts:</b> This probably
 means that no mode changes (what Zygo calls "Mode Slews") are being
 detected from the beam sampler.
</ul>
<p>
More to come.

<h3><A NAME="hstzy7080">Zygo 7080 Optical Receiver</A></h3>

This unit looks similar to the HP/Agilent optical receivers
but has a 7 pin LEMO connector instead of the funny 4 pin BNC. :)
It is also a bit thicker, probably due to the size of the LEMO
connector.  Since the 7080 is used with the Zygo 7701 and
possibly other Zygo lasers with a much higher REF frequency (at least
20 MHz) than the HP/Agilent lasers, I assume its bandwidth is at least
30 MHz and possibly as much as 40 MHz.  Here is the cabling info as
best as I can determine:

<p>
I don't know how the LEMO connector is actually numbered so I have
labeled assuming the diagram below (viewed facing the female connector
on the receiver):
<p>

                3 o o 4
</PRE>
<p>
The cable had been cut so I have no idea if this is a standard Zygo cable
and thus the cable wire colors may be meaningless.
<p>
In addition to the LEMO, there is a test point, presumably for signal
strength monitoring, like on the HP/Agilent optical receivers.
<p>
According to the Zygo operation manual, V+ is +8 VDC +/-0.5 V at 0.3 A max
and V- is -8 VDC +/-0.4 V at 0.75 A max.
<p>
V- may be used only to provide negative bias to -Vs of an AD9696 ultrafast
The positive supply (at least) needs to be well regulated - when
using one with a bit of ripple, operation was erratic and the presence
of the output signal correlated with the power line frequency.
<p>
The optical input for testing was a red LED driven through a bridge rectifier
made of 1N4148s (to double the pulse rate) from a function generator.
As expected, the output was a differential signal with a response starting
at about 150 kHz on the input.  I haven't tested the high end yet, only
to around 8 MHz, the (doubled) limit of the function generator.  But the
response appears very sensitive to signal level, much more so than with
the HP/Agilent optical receivers.  In fact, depending on signal level and
offset (relative intensities of the positive and negative half-cycles
for the LED), the output frequency sometimes equaled the input pulse rate
and at other times was half of it.
<p>
However, when tested with a Zygo 7701 laser head, the output was always
10 Mhz, the split frequency divided by 2, which is what it should be.
So, I guess it really expects a roughly sinusoidal waveform for the optical
signal.

 Sub-Table of Contents</A>.
<h2>Other Commercial Stabilized HeNe Lasers</h2>

These are mostly OEM or special systems that were part of or associated with
larger pieces of equipment.  Well, only one so far. :)
<p>
For examples of home-built stabilized HeNe lasers, see the sectiions starting
with <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chnstab">Inexpensive Home-Built Frequency or
Intensity Stabilized HeNe Laser</A>.

<h3><A NAME="hstosl1">Stabilized HeNe Laser from Bomem FTIR Spectrometer</A></h3>

This is a (likely) custom unit put together by Bomem or one of its
sub-contractors.  <A HREF="bssl1-oi.jpg">Stabilized HeNe Laser from Bowmen FTIR
Spectrometer - Overall Interior View</A> shows what's inside, which isn't
much. :)
<p>
Although the label on the HeNe laser tube says Carl Zeiss, there is no doubt
that it is made by Siemens: The model is LGR-7621, which is a
Siemens model, and the remainder of the label is Siemens style.  So, what
about this is not clear? :)  It is about 10 inches in length
with anode-end output and a rated output power of 2 mW.  (Its label also
has the same irrelevant reference to Patlex patent number 4,704,583 as
most HP/Agilent tubes discussed elsewhere in this chapter - and it is
equally irrelevant for this one.)  The normal dual mode
thermal control technique is used with feedback provided by a pair of
reflections from the uncoated surfaces of the roof prism - the one from
the front, and the other through and back off the opposite surface.
Polarizers oriented at 90 degrees select the two modes for the the
photodiodes.
<p>
The entire controller is on the little PCB.  Heat transfer to the environment
is aided by the large heat-sink.  Note the extra 1,000 uF capacitor,
possibly added when it was determined that the HeNe laser power supply,
which runs on 24 VDC, resulted in excessive droop on the DC power input
when starting.
<p>
The locking sequence is rather interesting).  Initially, it runs the
heater at a power that switches between about 12 and 19 V on the heater
apparently depending on whether the output mode is low or high, respectively.
This results in about 35 complete mode sweeps, probably based
on the mode sweep period exceeding some value like 15 or 20 seconds.  Then
it switches to optical feedback and locks with the heater voltage at about
6 V.  This entire process takes about 5 minutes.  Since 35 mode sweeps
represents a relatively modest temperature
rise - half of the 70 mode sweeps typical of other stabilized lasers -
it loses lock after 2 or 3 minutes when the internal heating from the tube
current increases the temperature such that the heater would have to generate
negative heat to maintain a stable mode position.  Once it's detected that
the modes changed enough to be unlocked, it  turns the
heater back on doing it flipping thing for another 7 or 8 mode sweeps and again
switches back to optical feedback, this time with the heater voltage at
about 8 V.  A similar sequence happens again after anywhere from
10 to 50 minutes if the laser cover is in place (but possibly
never if it is not and convection cooling is more effective).  Eventually,
it settles in at a position which can be maintained by the heater.  Maybe. :)
Although I haven't checked, it's possible that if it were unable to lock
with maximum heater power meaning the lock point was at too high a
temperature relative to ambient, it would do the reverse and allow
the tube to cool for a few mode sweeps and then switch back to optical
feedback.  This approach does make sense in a convoluted sort of way
so I don't think the particular laser I have is broken, just a bit smarter
than the average stabilized HeNe despite the apparent simplicity of
the controller PCB! :)  On the other hand, maybe it's just misadjusted
or broken.  While I can identify the mode balance pot, there is another one
whose function is not known.  It looks like an afterthought being globbed
in hot melt glue without direct connections to the PCB, and reverse
engineering the circuit will be difficult for that reason.
<p>
The output from the laser is a single polarized mode
passed by a Polarizing Beam-Splitter (PBS) cube visible at the
bottom-right of the photo.  There may be an optic missing - or at least
an option that isn't installed.  A short focal length lens after
the PBS cube results in a divergent beam that is never collimated.  So
it becomes a blob larger than the diamond aperture at the far left,
and much of the power is lost.  There is also a pair of suspiciously empty
mounting holes in about the right position for a collimating lens, a few
inches to the left of the PBS cube.  But a similar laser installed in
the Bomem spectrometer also lacks a collimating lens, so perhaps a large area
beam is more important than a lot of power.  And the holes look pristine.
<p>
The output power <i>is</i> rather pathetic.  By the time the beam reaches the
output, not much is left.  About 2/3rds is lost in the prism, PBS cube, and
expanding lens, though half of this is because only a single polarized mode is
sent through the PBS cube.  But 3/4ths of the remainder is blocked by that
diamond-shaped output aperture!  So, starting with almost 2.2 Mw out of
the tube, only about 0.25 mW makes it out of the laser!
<p>
Specifications for frequency and/or intensity stability of this laser are not
known.  However, since this is for a spectrometer, really precise frequency
stability probably isn't essential.
<p>
The entire laser assembly is about 19x9x2 inches overall.  For some
mysterious reason, it is much larger in person than it appears in the
photo, above. :)
