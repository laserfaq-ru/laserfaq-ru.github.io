<h2>Introduction, Related Information, Acknowledgement, Safety</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apsbcs1">Basic Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply
 Considerations</A></h3>

Small air-cooled Ar/Kr ion tubes require an operating voltage of around 100 to
110 VDC at 3 to 10 AMPs and a starting voltage of about 8 to 10 kV (but almost
no current).  While these basic requirements are in some ways similar to those
of a HeNe tube, the shear value of the current - measured in AMPs - means
that providing a power supply that doesn't self destruct, destroy the laser
tube, or fry you in the process, is much more of a non-trivial task.
<p>
Note: Most parameters here are given for argon ion tubes since these are most
common.  However, while physically interchangeable krypton and mixed gas ion
tubes are very similar electrically, they will have slightly lower starting
and operating voltages.  This isn't a problem for starting, but the difference
in operating voltage can be significant enough to cause some power supply
compatibility problems such as excessive power dissipation in the regulator
circuits.  This should be kept in mind if substituting tube types.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtsa4">Comparison of Argon and Krypton Ion
Tube Characteristics</A> for a specific example.
<ul>
<li>The typical discharge voltage is 100 to 110 VDC into very nearly a short
  circuit - very low ohms.  Theoretically, it is not a negative resistance as
  with a HeNe tube, at least.  However, a combination of factors can still
  result in runaway if the effective series (ballast) resistance of the system
  is too low.
<p>
  The source for the operating voltage is either a direct line-connected
  rectifier/filter 'front-end' or this followed by a high frequency inverter.
  (RF excitation is also possible but I don't know of any commercial examples
  of this approach.)
<p>
<li>Operating current must be controlled and variable (to adjust beam power)
  from around 3 A to 10 A (which is the usual maximum specified current though
  more may be used in some cases and for larger lasers).  Feedback based on
  tube current and direct optical monitoring of the beam (light control)
  is a must for continuous unattended operation.  This provides the lowest
  noise and maximizes tube life.  Modulation of the beam power can also be
  provided via an external input.
<p>
  A series linear or switchmode (buck) regulator may be used with the line
  connected supply.  Some power supplies use a combination of a switchmode
  preregulator to drop the rectified filtered line voltage to a range where
  a linear regulator can run with reduced power dissipation and use fewer,
  lower cost pass-bank transistors.  Inverters will use PWM control of their
  drive.
<p>
<li>The Ar/Kr ion tube uses a heated filament-cathode.  This requires a
  separate 2.5 to 3 V supply at 15 to 25 AMPs.  The cathode must be up to
  operating temperature (usually about a 30 second to 1 minute delay from
  power-on in PREHEAT mode) prior to initiating the discharge to prevent
  damage to the tube.  Commercial power supplies provide this delay
  automatically.
<p>
  A simple low voltage power transformer with a centertapped secondary usually
  supplies the filament current.  Fine adjustment of filament current can be
  done using a tapped primary or Variac.  The use of AC is actually beneficial
  and helps to spread the heat from the discharge over the extent of the
  cathode (filament) by dithering the arc position.
<p>
  Note that although the plasma temperature is extremely high, this is only
  true in the actual bore - which may start several inches away from the
  filament.  Thus, you really do want the filament powered prior to initiating
  the discharge and at all times while it is running.  If the filament loses
  power for some reason and cools down, the voltage drop between the filament
  and the discharge will increase leading to much greater power dissipation
  and hot spots.  Depending on the main DC power supply, the discharge may
  just go out without any harm but for some, this may not be the case and the
  regulator may keep trying to maintain the specified current as the tube
  voltage climbs.  I don't know how many times you can get away with this and
  how quickly it will damage or kill a tube but would rather not find out!
<p>
<li>The starter (generally called an igniter in this case - sounds much more
  impressive, doesn't it?!), must be designed taking into consideration that
  the full discharge current must pass through any blocking diodes or series
  inductor/transformer.  Therefore, those whimpy parasitic multipliers used
  for HeNe tubes will not work!
<p>
  A design discharging a capacitor into a high current high voltage pulse
  transformer is often used.  However, some types generate a burst of radio
  frequency (sort of like a mini-Tesla coil) to avoid potential damage to
  the tube cathode from a high current high voltage pulse.
<p>
<li>Finally, while not strictly a power requirement, these Ar/Kr ion tubes
  requires LOTS of cooling.  The air-cooled type must have a HUGE fan passing
  air through the elaborate heat sink fins of the tube with all plenums and/or
  baffles in place.  After all, it will be dissipating 1,000 W OR MORE at full
  power - about the same as a medium size space heater!
<p>
<li>And, most important: Safety, electrical, and thermal protection and
  interlocks MUST be provided for this sort of high power laser equipment.
  Circuit failure or carelessness can result in unfortunate consequences.
  Optical shutters, beam-on indicators, and all other CDRH required laser 
  safety devices are also essential.
</ul>
Note that what we are talking about are Ar/Kr ion tubes putting out up to a
few hundred mW of beam power.  These are not small by HeNe laser standards.
The lowest power models are still about 12 inches (30 cm) long with a diameter
(including all the cooling fins and other attached structure) of about 4
inches (10 cm).
<p>
Large frame Ar/Kr ion tubes can be over a meter in length and nearly everything
about them is, well, much larger. :-)  There are even 8 FOOT (2.5 m) long
monster medical lasers that output 35 W or more and require over 600 V at 35 A
to power the tube.  Figure on a direct feed from a local electric utility
substation for this kind of power!  Ion lasers like these may also have axial
permanent or electro-magnets surrounding the tube to concentrate the discharge
and other 'stuff' that we will kind of ignore. ;-)  They also require several
gallons per minute from a tap or chilled water source to prevent a melt-down.
<p>
For these reasons, while the offer of a cheap or free large frame ion laser
may sound tempting, consider the power and cooling requirements before dragging
it home.  It will likely end up as a coffee table support or high-tech
sculpture if you don't have industrial strength three-phase power at your
disposal!  Cooling water may also be a problem.  Nonetheless, most of the
basic information on small air-cooled ion lasers DOES apply to their bigger
brothers as well if the numbers are adjusted appropriately.  And, the power
supplies are quite similar.  In fact, the same power supply can often be used
for a wide variety of ion lasers by selecting the AC input and changing some
jumpers.
<p>
Throughout this chapter, references will be made to several commercial Ar/Kr
ion lasers systems.  Two of the most common are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>American Laser Corporation (Salt Lake City, Utah), Model 60X second sourced
  as the Omnichrome (now a division of the
  <A HREF="http://www.mellesgriot.com/">Melles Griot</A>,
  Carlsbad, CA) model 532 (designated the ALC-60X/Omni-532).  The
  general features of this laser are described (with photos) in the chapter:
  <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argtoc">Argon/Krypton Ion Lasers</A>.  This is
  a small air-cooled argon ion external mirror tube good for up to several
  hundred mW on all or selected lines (depending on specific model).  This is
  the most common laser of this type and relatively widely - and increasingly
  available on the surplus market.
<p>
  A few oddball versions of the 60X (60XB and 60XC) are still manufactured
  but the 532 is an obsolete model.  American and Omnichrome both make/made a
  few zillion variations on the same theme.  All of them look similar and have
  common features.  American still makes replacement tubes for the 60X but
  they do much higher power with newer generation technology.  Call ALC and
  request a generic brochure if you are curious (or more than curious).
<p>
  <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Photos of Various Laser Systems, Power
  Supplies, and Components</A> has detailed views of various argon/krypton ion
  lasers including examples of the 60 series from American Laser Corporation.
  However, note that the ALC power supply shown in the photos will drive the
  same laser heads, it is NOT the same implementation as the Omni-150R
  described in detail in the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom1">Omnichrome
  150R Power Supply and 532 Laser Head (Omni-150R/532)</A>.  They differ
  physically as well: The ALC (there are a variety of versions) is in an
  elongated goldish-aluminum ("Alodined") box (as in the photos) while the
  Omni is shorter and painted black.
<p>
<li>Lexel Laser, Inc. (now out of business) Model 88
  (designated the Lexel-88).  They have various argon, krypton, and mixed gas
  ion lasers with up to several WATTS of beam power using the same linear
  power supply (though apparently not sold with the relatively small Model 88
  anymore.  This series is probably the next most commonly
  available ion laser compared to the ALC-60X/Omni-532.
</ul>

units are provided in the chapter: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#asctoc">Complete

<h3><A NAME="apssaf">SAFETY When Dealing with Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power
 Supplies</A></h3>

Whether you have constructed your own power supply, are testing an old one,
or just checking out a newly acquired Ar/Kr ion tube, SAFETY must come first:
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser Safety</A> with respect
to the optical hazards associated with these higher power lasers.  While
generally not in the metal cutting class, careless use of Ar/Kr ion lasers can
certainly result in instant and permanent damage to vision.  There are all
going to be at least Class IIIb and some are Class IV.
<p>
However, when compared even to large HeNe lasers, there are many additional
very real dangers associated with Ar/Kr ion laser power supplies:
<ul>
<li>Line connected - Almost all Ar/Kr ion laser power supplies are directly
  line connected since the 115 VAC (or 230 VAC or 208 VAC three-phase) are
  quite convenient for providing (after rectification and filtering) the
  required value of the raw DC that is needed.  Any power transformer would be
  large and expensive, and functionally at least, not necessary.
<p>
<li>High current - Up to 10 AMPS or more at over 100 V (for small Ar/Kr ion
  tubes - larger ones may have much more) will be present in various parts of
  the power supply.  Your body will make just as nice a path for that 10 A as
  the laser tube - but you will be much less happy or dead!
<p>
<li>High power resistors and transistors - These will be HOT enough to burn in
  some cases AND line connected as well!
<p>
<li>High voltage starting pulse - 8 kV or more present at the laser tube anode
  isn't likely to kill but can cause a reflex reaction which may have
  unfortunate consequences (as in you rip and burn your flesh, and electrocute
  yourself simultaneously).  And, that 8 kV is on top of a possible 400 V
  boost voltage use for powering the starter AND the greater than 100 V main
  DC high current supply!
<p>
<li>For large water-cooled lasers, keep in mind that water and electricity do
  not make a happy combination.  Tap water connections are basically grounded
  through the plumbing and the water itself.  And, any water leaks will create
  all sorts of problems.  Needless to say, should this occur, pull the plug or
  kill the breaker at the service panel, wait for the capacitors to discharge,
  check them, and clean up everything before attempting to do anything else!
</ul>
Read, understand, AND FOLLOW, the guidelines provided in the document:
<A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered
Equipment</A>.
<p>
In addition:
<ul>
<li>DO take advantage of all safety interlocks unless absolutely required for
  specific tests or measurements.
<p>
<li>DO provide insulating shields or barriers and install all protective covers
  unless actually requiring access for testing to prevent accidental contact
  with electrically or thermally hot components.  This is especially important
  since people working with lasers tend to do so in darkened rooms and may not
  know exactly where their extremities are at any given time!
<p>
<li>DO make sure that your house wiring can handle prolonged operating at 12 A
  or more and that the PROPER rated fuse or circuit breaker is installed for
  the wiring size in your walls!
<p>
<li>DO provide adequate WARNING and CAUTION labels at all appropriate locations.
<p>
<li>DO keep a beam stop in place whenever not actually using the laser's output.
<p>
<li>DO keep others - especially kids and pets - at a safe distance!

<h2>Types, Alternatives to Home-Built System</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apstah0">Not Quite as Many Choices</A></h3>

While there may be some variations on the type of operating and starting
voltage supplies, there are far fewer options for ion lasers compared to HeNe
lasers. Partly this is because there are far fewer variations in Ar/Kr ion
tube characteristics and partly because the magnitude of the discharge current
eliminates certain approaches from practical consideration.
<p>
Some basics:
<ul>
<li>Operating voltage/current: For small air-cooled tubes, this is typically
 100 to 110 VDC at 3 to 10 A.  (Larger lasers of this type might use 35 A or
 more!)  Like HeNe laser power supplies, two basic options here are AC line
 and inverter types:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>AC line:  This takes the power input and rectifies and filters it to
  provide relatively low ripple DC voltage to a series linear or switchmode
  (buck) regulator.  Such supplies are generally NOT isolated.  An isolation
  transformer could be used but it would be large, heavy, and expensive.
<p>
  For small air-cooled tubes, the power supply runs off of single phase
  115 VAC and deliver around 150 VDC to the regulator.  High power lasers
  will run off of 230 VAC, 240/208 VAC three-phase, or something even
  nastier to produce up to 600 VDC at 45 A OR MORE!
<p>
  Note: Throughout this document, we use 115 VAC as the nominal line voltage
  in the U.S.  However, the actual measured voltage may range from about 105
  to 125 VAC and still be considered to be within acceptable limits by the
  utility company.   For this single-phase system, using both Hot legs of
  the line will then result in a nominal 230 VAC which may actually range
  from about 210 to 250 VAC.
<p>
  A buck-boost autotransformer (NOT isolated!) may be included to more
  closely match the line input to the requirements of the ion tube thus
  reducing the stress on the regulator (see below).
<p>
  This is the simplest (!!) sort of approach to take for these tubes.  For
  testing, a 5 to 10 ohm ballast (possibly variable) resistor and a Variac
  can be used (without a regulator) as long as one eyeball is kept on the
  current monitor.  Of course, the ballast resistor needs to be able to
  dissipate several HUNDRED watts - the element of a space heater may work
  well for this.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdspl0">Constructing Low Ohm High Power
  Resistors</A>.
<p>
 <li>For continuous operation, a regulator is essential to achieve maximum tube
  life and maintain stable optical output.
<p>
  This can use a pass-bank of power transistors operating in linear mode
  (which makes a nice space heater for colder climates) or as a chopper
  operating as a switchmode buck converter.  (Note, however, that the latter
  type is usually still line-connected - there is NO isolation transformer.)
  The Lexel-88 and ALC-60X/Omni-532 (150R) power supplies are typical of
  each of these approaches, respectively.
<p>
 <li>Inverter: The (non-isolated) AC line is rectified and filtered to provide
  around 150 VDC or doubled and filtered to provide around 300 VDC (assuming
  a 115 VAC input).  This is applied to a DC-DC converter which implements
  regulation through PWM control of the chopper transistor on-time.  The
  advantages of this approach are that the laser power circuitry can be
  totally isolated from the line and any required tube voltage can be
  provided without regard to the AC line voltage (except to the extent that
  the branch circuit has to provide the needed current!).
<p>
  Such high power inverters can be tricky to design.  One approach I have
  considered is to use the salvaged inverter from the solid state power
  supply from some model microwave ovens.  (However, these modules are sort
  of rare since the simple half wave doubler operating from a HV line power
  transformer/HV cap/HV diode is such a low cost reliable design and not
  very models used them.)  The power supply for a full size oven is normally
  designed for at least 1,000 W (which is ideal) but at too high a voltage
  (3 to 5 kV pulsating DC rather than the 100 to 110 VDC we need).  However,
  by rewinding the secondary of the ferrite transformer (only a few dozen
  turns of heavy Litz wire would be required) and adding some primary side
  filter capacitors, it could be adapted to an Ar/Kr ion laser application.
  I have not tried this as yet but have one such module sitting around
  impatiently waiting for its call to duty. :-)
<p>
  See the section: <A HREF="laserapd.htm#apditc1">High Frequency Inverter
  Type Microwave Oven HV Power Supplies</A> for more info on these modules.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Ignition voltage.  Several kV (large lasers may require up to 30 kV or
 more) but almost no current is required to ionize the gas in the tube.
 However, due to the actual processes which take place during the transition
 from this simple glow discharge to a high current arc, igniter design appears
 to be somewhat of an art - at least if a variety of Ar/Kr ion tubes are to be
 handled reliably.  Additional energy may need to be dumped into the tube at
 the instant ionization occurs for starting to be consistently successful.
 A burst of radio frequency instead of simply a high voltage pulse may be
 used since it is considered less stressfull on the tube cathode.
<p>
 Therefore, for all of these reasons, the voltage multipliers, flybacks, and
 HV pulse transformers typically used with HeNe lasers cannot be pressed into
 service for starting Ar/Kr ion tubes.  In addition, the full 10 AMPS or
 whatever of operating current would need to pass through them once the tube
 starts (with the HeNe, it is just a few mA).
<p>
 The usual way to generate the starting voltage is with a high current pulse
 transformer.  One design uses a toroid with 30 turns on the secondary - in
 series with the anode - and a 1.5 turn primary.  Discharging a 1 uF, 400 V
 capacitor into the primary results in an 8 kV output pulse.  There may be
 resonating and snubber components as well.  Care must be taken in design to
 minimize undershoot on the secondary - which can just as easily blow out the
 discharge as well as start it if it is large enough!  However, the idea of
 the resonant circuit may be to actually generate a burst of radio frequency
 energy like a mini-Tesla coil.  The RF then actually ionizes the gas in
 the tube rather than depending on high voltage to break it down.  This is
 considered less stressful on the tube cathode.
<p>
 This type of pulse/resonant igniter is almost always required for older and
 larger ion tubes.  However, for some 'small' short bore designs, other
 options may exist.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdipb1">Alternative Starting Circuits for
 Small Ar/Kr Ion Tubes</A>.
<p>
<li>Filament voltage: This usually comes from a dedicated high current
 step-down power transformer with a centertapped secondary.  A Variac or
 tapped primary is usually used to adjust filament voltage.  Typical
 requirements are 2.5 to 3.0 VAC at 15 to 25 A.  The exact requirements will
 be in the tube specs.
<p>
 Salvaged microwave oven transformers with the HV windings removed work well
 in this application.  In this case, simply 'adjusting' the number of turns
 or partial turns on the modified secondary may be adequate for setting
 filament current.  However, it may require an axe, power drill, torch, and
 several chisels to remove the baked on coil.  I *am* exaggerating but only
 slightly. :-)
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="apsalps">Arc Lamp Power Supply for Ion Laser?</A></h3>

Since the electrical characteristics of ion laser tubes and some types of
high intensity discharge lamps are quite similar in terms of voltage and
current, it may be possible to use a commercial arc lamp power supply for an
air-cooled Ar/Kr ion laser.  Some of these units have active constant current
or constant power regulation (probably a switchmode buck converter) and may be
available inexpensively from surplus dealers or via auction sites like eBay.
While the original cost may have been high, most people don't have a clue
as to alternative uses.  So, unless they have the specific model lamp they
are designed to operate, a good deal may be possible.
<p>
Like ion laser tubes, arc lamps usually require a starting voltage (up to 30
kV depending on type) so even the igniter may be built in to the unit!  You
will need a separate filament supply but that is a small price to pay for not
having to build an entire power supply.
<p>
I don't know how the regulation on the typical arc lamp power supply compares
to a well designed ion laser power supply but it should be much better than
nothing!  And, these devices will have all sorts of protection and safety
features required for commercial applications.
<p>
However, not being designed with the particular peculiarities of ion laser
tubes in mind, there could be potential instabilities or other regulation
problems.  Conceivably, additional (fractional Ohm) series resistance may
be needed.  Be aware of the possible symptoms to know what may happen.  See
the section: <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argmlh1">Plasma Oscillations and Other
Instabilities in Ion Lasers</A>.

h3><A NAME="apssmps">Using Common SMPSs to Construct an Ion Laser Power
 Supply</A></h3>

The following is one person's experience with adapting a pair of surplus
multiple output switchmode power supplies (SMPSs) to power a Cyonics/Uniphase
argon ion laser head.
<P>
I wouldn't recommend this approach for someone without a great deal of
experience in switchmode power supplies as the most likely result would be
lots of smoke and disappointment.  However, it does represent a possible
alternative to buying an expensive commercial power supply or building one
from scratch, particularly for locations where only 230 VAC is available.
Surplus SMPSs are readily available, often for next to nothing.  With a bit
of work (OK, maybe a bit more than a bit of work!), they can be converted
into the main portion of an efficient ion laser power supply.
<p>
CAUTION: Not all multiple output switchers can be easily modified in this
manner.  More extensive changes may be necessary or it may simply be
impossible to get from point A to point B using the existing design.

I've written an article which describes the modification of some cheap surplus
switchmode power supplies for powering my argon ion laser tube.  Go to:

<h3><A NAME="apsscsp">Steve's Comments on Switchmode Power Supplies and
 Phase Converters</A></h3>

The whole idea of a switchmode power supply is that as long as
the rectified line voltage is higher then the tube voltage by about
10 volts or more, you can run the tube. How much current you can get
is then determined by the impedance of your power line, instead of the
dissipation limits of the traditional pass-bank. What you trade off for
this service, is A: A loss of regulation at higher currents, B: As you
increase current to the tube, you may run into a lack of power for
your magnet and cathode as the line voltage sags.  C: Often somewhat
unstable operation of the plasma with some winking or chirping or
visible flickering at high currents.  For example, my I90MRA running
full out on a switcher shows some 60 Hz flickering of the low gain violet and
green lines synchronous to the power line peaks.  This is because you
can never have enough filter capacitors with a switcher as they
regulate by pulse width modulating the rectified line voltage  at
20 to 50 kHz. What's between the modulator and the plasma tube is
usually a simple filter consisting of a inductor and a small filter cap,
<p>
It's been my experience and that of some medical technicians that tubes
ran for long terms on switchers at high currents die from sagged cathodes.
<p>
You can/will experience similar problems with a 3 phase variable
drive speed drive depending on your line loading.
<p>
A medical technician friend of mine travels with a professional Ronk
rotary converter, its much smaller then the 10/12 hp motor used in the
home made phase converters and you can lift it with two hands.  We had
no trouble running a 3 phase Lexel-95 supply (yes the huge heavy
one) in my garage with the Ronk, its a little noisy, but it seems
to be the best solution for single phase.

<h3><A NAME="apstah1">So You Still Want to Build an Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply?</A></h3>

With the need to provide all this high power and dangerous circuitry to power
even a 'small' air-cooled ion tube, it should be clear that if you can beg,
borrow, buy, or otherwise liberate a commercial Ar/Kr ion laser power supply
for your needs, by all means do so!  Even if the unit is in absolutely total
disrepair (including being run over by a fork-lift, dropped from a 10 story
building, or having suffered a China-Syndrome style melt-down), it will likely
be far easier to revive and restore something that once worked than to create
your own.  Any required modifications will almost certainly be far easier than
starting from scratch.  This isn't like a little HeNe job as any faults can be
spectacular and depressing.
<p>
If you really have no choice, or just like a challenge, by far the most
straightforward approach is to use a line connected rectifier/filter with a
linear regulator.  While not quite as efficient as a switchmode or inverter
type, the hassles are fewer and parts are more readily available.  For initial
testing, a low value high wattage ballast resistor can substitute for the
regulator.  Just don't be tempted to leave it this way permanently.  And, in
any case, don't neglect the essential current monitor!
<p>
Note that if all you want to do is test a newly acquired Ar/Kr ion tube, there
may be a considerably simpler alternative to a continuous high current power
supply.  See the section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apspit0">Pulsed Operation of
an Ar/Kr Ion Tube</A>.

<h2>Organization of Linear, Switchmode, Inverter Types, Foreign Power</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apsols0">Typical Organization of Ar/Kr Power Supply with Series Regulator</A></h3>

A bridge rectifier and filter network (C-R-C or C-L-C typical) provides about
150 VDC directly from the 115 VAC line input.
<p>
The igniter (starter) circuit may operate off of this DC+ supply or an
additional low current 'boost' source to use a higher voltage (which reduces
the turns-ratio of its high current pulse transformer - a hard to wind (or
high cost) part.
<p>
The current regulator uses bipolar or MOSFET transistors in a linear or
switchmode (buck converter) configuration.  Some power supplies use a
combination of a switchmode preregulator to drop the rectified filtered line
voltage to a range where a linear regulator can run with reduced power
dissipation and use fewer, lower cost pass-bank transistors.
<p>
Feedback based on current, light (beam) sensing, or an external modulation
signal, is used to maintain the proper discharge current through the tube.
For initial testing, this can be done manually using a high power adjustable
ballast resistor and possibly a large Variac on the AC line input to the power
supply.  However, light feedback is required to minimize optical noise in the
laser beam and to maximize ion tube life.

This type of supply with a linear regulator would be the easiest to construct.
While efficiency is lower (abysmal instead of just terrible - probably about
40% more heat generated than for a well designed switcher), the difficulties
of implementing a robust and fool-proof Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) controller
are eliminated.  Just provide a large enough heat sink and jet turbine driven
cooling fans!
<p>
Since everything except possibly some logic or low level analog circuits are
directly line connected, great care (even more than just considering the
1,500 W or so of raw power we are dealing with!) must be taken in the basic
construction, testing, and adherence to ALL safety precautions, implementation
of ALL safety, electrical, and thermal interlocks and protective devices.  In
many cases, even that control circuitry is line-connected as this simplifies
the implementation since no isolated interfaces are required.

<h3><A NAME="apsols1">Typical Organization of Inverter Type Ar/Kr Power Supply</A></h3>

A bridge rectifier or voltage doubler and filter network (C-R-C or C-L-C
typical) provides about 150 VDC or 300 VDC respectively from the 115 VAC line.
This is used by the DC to DC inverter to produce the required 100 to 110 VDC
to the Ar/Kr ion tube.
<p>
The igniter (starter) circuit may operate off of this DC+ supply, a separate
winding on the inverter transformer, or an additional low current 'boost'
source to use a higher voltage (which reduces the turns-ratio of its high
current pulse transformer - a hard to wind (or high cost) part.
<p>
Feedback based on current, light sensing, or an external modulation signal,
throttles the DC to DC inverter by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) - controlling
the duty cycle of the drive to its chopper transistor(s) in a manner similar
to that for controlling a series pass switchmode regulator.  However, there
are added design considerations in dealing with the characteristics of the
high frequency ferrite inverter transformer.

</PRE>
While still very dangerous to troubleshoot, at least the main tube circuits
are isolated from the AC line by the inverter transformer.  Aside from the
slightly reduced risk of frying yourself, I would probably not recommend the
inverter approach unless you already have its foundation such as the HV power
module from a solid state microwave oven!

For more information, see the chapter: <A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdtoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply Design</A>.

<A NAME="apsols2">Ion Laser Power Supply on Foreign Power</A></h3>

The most common example of this would be to run a USA model power supply
(115 VAC/60 Hz) on European power (230 VAC/50 Hz) or vice-versa.  By far the
most significant difference is the voltage as there is usually very little
that is affected by line frequency in an ion laser power supply but see the
comments below.  The best solution will depend on the model and type of the
power supply (e.g., linear or switchmode) so there is no one-size-fits-all
answer.  Obviously, it is best to check with the laser or power supply
manufacturer.  However, here are some general comments on the voltage
conversion:
<p>
<ul>
<li>For linear power supplies, conversion is virtually impossible unless the
 unit already includes a buck/boost transformer with suitable taps since the
 pass-bank would need to drop a grossly different amount of voltage.  Even if
 the devices could handle the voltage, power dissipation would skyrocket for
 the conversion to 230 VAC input.  Going the other way, it is unlikely that a
 high enough voltage could be supplied to the laser head.  Some linear PSUs
 like the one for the Lexel-88 have the needed tapped transformers and
 whatever else is needed to select input power.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserasc.htm#asclx1">Lexel-88 Power Supply and Laser Head
 (Lexel-88)</A>.
<p>
<li>For switchers, inverters, or hybrids (which also include a linear
 pass-bank for fine regulation), conversion may be possible but would need to
 be determined on a case-by-case basis.  The main filter capacitor would have
 to be rewired and chopper and related components might need to be changed,
 added, or removed.  For one example, see the section:
 <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascomcon">Converting the Omni-150 from 115 VAC to 220
 VAC Operation?</A>.
<p>
<li>Logic and analog power, front panel indicators, and fuses and circuit
 breakers, etc., would each have to be dealt with to maintain functionality
 and safety.
</ul>

The most straightforward approach and the one with the lowest risk is to use
an external buck/boost autotransformer. Yes, for the required amount of AC
power, these will be heavy.  However, such a unit should not be that expensive
(at least compared to the cost of the laser!) and will solve all voltage
compatibility problems without needing to make any changes to the power supply
itself.  Select a transformer that can provide the maximum required line
current with minimal voltage droop (say, less than 5 percent) and that is
rated for continuous duty.
<p>
As for line frequency, going from 60 Hz to 50 Hz may affect the amount of
filtering required after the rectifiers, and heating of the low voltage power
transformer(s) and AC relays (if any).  However, this really isn't likely to
be an issue unless the design was marginal to begin with!  The only other
issue would be any logic (like the preheat timer of the Omni-150) that uses
the line frequency as a clock and would then run slow - likely not a problem
in any case.  Powering a 50 Hz unit on 60 Hz should be fine except for the
possible timer running fast.  In either case, if there are already taps and/or
jumpers for selecting dual voltage operation, the frequency difference was
probably already taken into consideration.  If not, then this will need to
be evaluated as well but the required changes, if any, should be minor
compared to those required to convert to a different line voltage.

<h2>Making Measurements and Power Supply Testing</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apsmmt0">Measurements of Current and Voltage in Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A></h3>

Monitoring of discharge current is essential to maintain the health of your
Ar/Kr ion tube (and power supply).  Various voltage measurements may be needed
as well.  However, because of the high currents involved AND the non-isolated
nature of the power supply, this isn't as trivial as connecting your Radio
Shack DMM into the circuit:
<p>
Note: Where the use of a panel meter is suggested below, if you salvaged the
meter movement from some other equipment or your junk, box, double check the
actual sensitivity.  There should be a rating printed at the bottom of the
meter face or the back of the unit like "fs=1mA", "fs=10A", or something
similar.  Even though the scale may be labeled with a particular set of units
and values, a series or shunt resistor may actually be needed to adapt the
basic movement to read at that sensitivity.  An AC meter may actually use a
DC movement with an external rectifier!  It's also a good idea to test the
meter to confirm that it hasn't been damaged due to an overload or just age.
<ul>
<li>Tube discharge current - THIS IS CRITICAL for the longevity of your Ar/Kr
 ion tube.  Don't ignore it!  Monitoring of 10 A or more may be needed.  A
 a low value high power shunt resistor is the easiest way to obtain this
 reading.
<p>
 A .1 ohm 50 W power resistor will develop .1 V/A across it resulting in 1 V
 at the maximum likely tube current of 10 A.  The shunt must be stable with
 respect to temperature (which is one reason for using a 50 W resistor when
 the maximum sustained dissipation is only 10 W).  The system should then be
 calibrated with the actual voltmeter or mA meter to be used.
<p>
 While a VOM or DMM can be used, it is really best to have a dedicated meter
 for continuous discharge current monitoring.  There are two reasons:
<p>
 Note: Most cheap VOMs or DMMs won't reliably measure resistances below a
 couple of ohms. To measure a low value resistor, get a D cell or power
 supply capable of a couple of amps and wire it to the unknown resistor in
 series with another power resistor that will drop the current to a value you
 can measure (or calculate).  Knowing the current, you can measure the voltage
 across the unknown resistor and calculate its value from R=V/I. WARNING: If
 you do this on a previously powered laser head, just make sure the caps are
 discharged!
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Limiting the discharge current is critical to the life of your Ar/Kr ion
  tube.  Therefore, the modest cost of these components is well worth it.
<p>
 <li>Any sort of probing of a line-connected system is risky.  Since you will
  want to be doing this often, these risks are multiplied.
 </ul>
<p>
 One way to implement a permanent current monitor is to use a basic panel
 meter.  This can be a moving coil (D'Arsonval) or digital type.  Add a
 variable series resistor for calibration using the current shunt.  For
 example, a meter rated at 1 mA full scale will require a total resistance
 of 1K ohms (for the meter itself and current limiting resistors) connected
 across the .1 ohm shunt to read 10 A full scale.

</PRE>
 Splitting the current limiting resistor into the fixed R1 and Calibrate pot
 (R2) allows easy fine adjustment without requiring an expensive 10 turn pot.
<p>
 Make the main current carrying connections to the power resistor.  Tap off
 of this go to the meter.  That way, it is less likely that a bad connection
 can result in the shunt opening - which would fry your meter in an instant!
<p>
 Calibrate this setup using a DC power supply and known accurate ammeter.
<p>
<li>For testing of a power supply with an active regulator in particular
 (linear or switchmode type), monitoring of the tube current with an
 oscilloscope or true AC ammeter with a high enough frequency response (say
 1 kHz) is desirable to assure that there aren't hidden oscillations in the
 feedback loop which can result in beam power variations as well as shortened
 Ar/Kr ion tube life due to the excessive peak current which wouldn't show up
 on a slow responding panel meter (a few Hz max) or as visible flickering of
 the laser beam (50 to 100 Hz max).   Oscillation isn't likely to be a problem
 with a brute force unregulated power supply (though it is not out of the
 question due to the possible negative resistance characteristics of the tube
 itself), but is quite possible if the loop transfer function of an active
 regulator turns out to be unstable.  Of course, an unregulated supply will
 likely have oscillation in current of its own - due to imperfect filtering
 at the line frequency or multiples thereof!
<p>
 <ul>Where the power supply is line-connected (not isolated), this measurement
  would have to be done differentially across the sense resistor, Rs (above) if
  the scope or meter has its case tied to ground since attaching this to the
  power supply would result in fireworks.
<p>
  With a dual trace scope, for example, set up the vertical channels to be A-B
  (A, invert B).
<p>
 <li>I don't recommend making a direct measurement of this type with a single
  trace scope since it would require isolating it from earth ground (floating
  the chassis).  This is a dangerous as now the entire chassis of the scope
  and all is exposed metal parts are connected to the AC line through the
  power supply.
<p>
 <li>An alternative procedure (with any scope) is to use a current transformer.
  The main current carrying conductor would pass through a toroid core with a
  several hundred turn secondary feeding a resistive load.  Details are left
  as an exercise for the student. :-)
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Pass-bank voltage - For series regulators, the voltage across the bank of
 power transistors is an indication of how hard they are working and is
 another useful thing to monitor continuously.  This can be used for both
 linear and switchmode regulators (between the input and beyond any filter
 components.
<p>
 A dedicated panel meter is best for this as well.  Obtain a panel meter
 with a full scale sensitivity of 75 to 100 V or add an appropriate series
 resistor to a current (e.g., 100 uA full scale) meter.  Make sure the
 resistor(s) can handle the maximum voltage!

</PRE>
<p>
<li>Ion tube voltage - while this isn't usually something that needs to be
 monitored unless there is a problem, it can tell you a lot about the health
 of the tube since gas pressure and discharge voltage at a given current are
 related.  There are two issues: the line connected power supply as noted
 above and the ignite pulse.  DO NOT put any sort of meter directly across
 the anode and cathode of the tube!  You will be needing a new meter if the
 igniter kicks in. :(  Instead, put an isolated voltmeter on a 200 VDC or
 higher range (for small air-cooled ion tubes) between the DC+ feed to the
 laser head and the tube cathode.  If there is a series current sensing
 resistor or blocking diode in series with the tube anode (in addition to the
 ignite transformer), estimate the voltage drop across these components and
 subtract it from the readings made after the tube starts.
<p>
<li>Logic, analog, and low voltages - Such measurements are tricky only because
 of the non-isolated nature of these power supplies.  Several different
 grounds or commons may be involved (e.g., earth ground, DC-, DC+, Tube-,
 etc.) and any of these may need to be the reference for your multimeter or
 oscilloscope.
<p>
 An isolation transformer is highly desirable for personal safety and to
 protect your (grounded) test equipment.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>For low power measurements where the actual high power circuitry won't be
  active, a normal 250 VA isolation transformer - which you likely already
  have or should have - will be adequate.  For details on constructing one,
  see the document:
  <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tshoot.htm">Troubleshooting of
  Consumer Electronic Equipment</A>.
<p>
 <li>Where the high power portions of the supply are active, reasonable size
  isolation transformers will be useless.  Something at least 2X of the
  maximum VA requirements of the system will be needed - which few people
  have!  Even an isolation transformer made from back-to-back or rebuilt
  microwave oven transformers is probably not large enough for testing a
  power supply at anywhere near full output but may be adequate at low tube
  current.  However, a pair of matching pole transformers might work. :-)
<p>
  Given that these are not usually handy, make sure you understand the safety
  guidelines provided in the document: <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety
  Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment</A> - AND FOLLOW
  THEM!  Minimize the amount of probing done under these conditions and make
  connections only with the unit unplugged and large capacitors discharged!
  Isolating the test equipement is better than nothing and will allow
  measurements to be made, but does not eliminate the danger.
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="apsmmt1">Initial Power Supply Testing</A></h3>

It should be safe to perform initial sequencing and voltage tests on a power
supply without attaching a laser head since the conditions are similar to
those present when a tube just doesn't want to start.  The interlocks will
need to be jumpered to fool it into thinking everything is in place to allow
it to enter the operate state or come on at all (depending on design).  Then,
measurements of the various voltages (e.g., filament, HV+, Boost) can be made
using an ISOLATED multimeter.  Of course, there is no load so testing of the
regulator (if any) won't be possible.  However, if these are present and
correct, there is an excellent chance the supply is functional.
<p>
Once you attach the laser head, ideally, one would possess 5 or 6 functioning
eyeballs to keep tabs on all aspects of a new Ar/Kr ion tube and power supply
combination as it is being tested for the first time.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Where there is no robust current regulator, for initial testing it is wise to
start at 7 or 8 Ohms and work down, even with the pi section CLC or CRC filter
as these discharges do possess a negative runaway characteristic despite what
the literature says.  For some reason it always seems to need a 2 to 4 ohm
offset above the calculated value or it will run away.
<p>
They also need a minimum current of about 3.5 amps to sustain the discharge
with a new tube and about 4.35 A as the tube grows older, this was just
measured in my shop with a new tube versus a tube with 2000 hours on it.  The
new one (an Omnichrome 532 with a buck converter) dropped out on line voltage
dips when it came from the factory set for a 3.25 A lower limit.  This was on
118.2 V AC.
<p>
Therefore when firing up a 'heater' (space heater ballast) based supply, you
often have to lower the resistance a little at a time to find the minimum
stable current point.  It is better to start a high resistance and work down.
Of course, you will have a permanent current monitor in the system!
<p>
Also see the sections: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsmmt0">Measurements of Current
and Voltage in Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A> and
<A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsmmt2">Testing with a Dummy Load</A>.

<h3><A NAME="apsmmt2">Testing with a Dummy Load</A></h3>

It should be possible to use a Variac and dummy load to determine basic
functionality of these power supplies.  However, there is no easy way to
simulate the Ar/Kr tube I/V characteristics.  The best that can reasonably
be done is to use a HUGE power resistor.  A 1,200 W space heater element
can be used for the load since this will draw about 10 A at 100 V.  A space
heater with more than one wattage setting (not only a thermostat!) can be used
to test at multiple simulated tube currents (but DON'T switch while powered!).
For example, assuming a nominal tube voltage drop of 100 V, use 600 W for 5 A,
900 W for 7 A, 1,200 W for 10 A, 1,500 W for 12 A.
<p>
It will be necessary to power the logic and control circuits separately for
this test so that their supply voltage is constant.
<p>
WARNING: Some commercial power supplies simple do not like to power anything
but a real tube with its nice non-linear V-I characteristic.  This is
particularly true of switchmode designs.  Therefore, I do not recommend
using a dummy load for these as many expensive parts will likely blow.
<p>
Provide wired-in monitoring of BOTH load (tube) current AND regulator voltage
drop.  (See the section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apsmmt0">Measurements of
Current and Voltage in Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supplies</A>.)
<p>
Select the load rating, with the Variac at 0, power on the main supply.  Bring
up the voltage slowly.
<ul>
<li>For power supplies without regulators, as you do so, the current should
  climb slowly, reaching approximately the expected current at nominal line
  voltage.
<p>
<li>For power supplies with regulators, as you do so, the current should climb
  to the value at which the regulator is set and then remain stable at that
  point through full line voltage and beyond (i.e., to 125 VAC).
<p>
<ul>
<li>With linear regulators, make sure that the voltage across the regulator
  NEVER exceeds the safe limits (much less than the breakdown ratings of the
  transistors) at any time.  There should be a zener clamp or other protection
  circuit to guarantee this during startup, normal operation, and fault
  conditions (e.g., shorted tube) as well!
<p>
<li>Check that any current limit or shutdown circuits function properly.
<p>
<li>For pass-banks using multiple transistors, check for proper current
  balancing at low, medium, and especially at maximum rated current.  With
  proper design, a variation of more than, say, 5 percent, could indicate a
  low Hfe transistor or out-of-tolerance discrete component.
</ul>
</ul>
CAUTION: Do not apply power suddenly - without a Variac - as the momentary
voltage drop across the regulator will be the full DC+ value which may blow
the transistor(s).  The voltage will also be excessive if you try to run at
a lower current than for what you based the load resistor for similar reasons.

<h3><A NAME="apsmmt3">Testing with an Inexpensive Laser Head</A></h3>

Argon ion laser heads often show up on the surplus market or from private
individuals whose tubes are weak or have other problems like messed up mirror
alignment.  While these were probably pulled from their original home in some
high speed printer due to low output and may be not be very desirable for
optics experiments or light shows, they are the ideal vehicle for ion laser
power supply testing.  Even if the voltage drop across the tube is slightly
low (as would be typical of a high mileage tube), that shouldn't matter and if
anything, is a slightly more strenuous test of the power supply!
<p>
The best type for testing probably have internal mirror ion tubes - eliminating
another set of hassles.  If mirror alignment turns out to be the only problem,
you can really win big since this is often correctable.  See the sections
starting with <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir">Problems with Mirror Alignment</A>

<h2>Ion Laser Power Supply Repair</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apsrep0">Typical Power Supply Failures and Possible
 Causes</A></h3>

Since these are high power devices, it isn't too surprising that failures
are common either due to problems in the power supply or the laser head.
While various protection devices are generally present, we all know that
the most expensive parts often blow to protect the fuses!  Such 'events' can
be quite spectacular resulting in smoke, flames, aroma of burnt stuff, and
parts which launch portions of themselves over considerable distances.  With
these line-connected circuits, a shorted bridge rectifier can turn the analog
control board to molten slag!
<p>
Needless to say, when designing such a power supply and selecting components,
err on the side of being conservative.  Select parts to run at much less than
their rated voltage, current, or power (maximum stress of 1/2 the part's
rating isn't too bad a rule-of-thumb).  This is especially important for
devices that fail in a sudden catastrophic manner like power semiconductors!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Highly stressed high power parts like transistors and resistors are prone
  to failure.  The cause may be a defect in the part itself, an overload
  downstream (e.g., a short in the laser head), or a fault in the control
  system.
<p>
<li>Laser head incompatibility or failure may result in damage to multiple
  parts of the power supply itself.  For example, the failure or lack of a
  series blocking diode in an ALC-60X or Omni-532 laser head (or one you are
  connecting to your power supply) may result in multiple blown parts in the
  power supply itself.  In the case of the Omni-150R, these may include the
  expensive MOSFETs (Q8 and Q9) and snubber diode (D21), snubber capacitor
  (C35), several resistors, and possibly other discrete components and ICs.
  See the section: <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom1">Omnichrome 150R Power Supply
  and 532 Laser Head (Omni-150R/532)</A> for sample schematics.
<p>
  In addition to the connections and wiring being compatible, the tube voltage
  is important as well.  Attempting to run a tube with a much lower voltage
  than for which the power supply was designed will result in excessive
  power dissipation in a linear pass-bank, or excessive strees on chopper
  transistors.  Attempting to run a higher voltage tube may result in a
  flashing laser since the power supply will be unable to maintain the
  arc, but if not allowed to run this way for long, probably no damage.
  But for gross mismatches, there are also issues like what voltage the
  starter circuit can handle.
<p>
<li>Cascade failures are common.  For example, where multiple power transistors
  are used in parallel in a regulator, if one goes, the regulator no longer
  exists for all intents and purposes and full input voltage is applied to the
  load.  The associated emitter current balancing resistor will likely be
  obliterated before any protective devices open up.
<p>
  Where a high power regulator uses a large series-parallel combination of
  power transistors, if one shorts, it may overstress others.  If there is
  inadequate protection, multiple devices will fail in rapid succession until
  the entire regulator behaves like a blob of solder taking other parts with
  it.  Even components that still appear to function may have suffered
  permanent damage during the overload.
<p>
<li>Line input components - diodes and capacitors - see the full AC current.
  The peak currents through the diodes and into and out of the filter
  capacitors can be many times the average load current.  This is more
  stressful and shortens the life of these components.  Since such huge
  amounts of power are potentially available, failures here can be truly
  spectacular and depressing!
<p>
<li>Electrolytic capacitors in particular fail from age and heat - both likely
  factors in ion laser power supplies.  They can suffer from reduced uF value,
  increased effective series resistance (ESR), increased leakage - or all of
  the above.  For example:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Faulty capacitors in the igniter can cause erratic starting or inability
    to start at all.
<p>
  <li>Faulty capacitors in the main smoothing network can result in loss of
    regulation, a reduced range over which the regulator functions properly,
    or an inability to maintain a stable discharge at all.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Heat in general is the enemy of even conservatively rated parts.  Lack of
  maintenance such as accumulated dirt and dust, or a sluggish fan, can
  quickly result in problems.
<p>
<li>Thermal cycling of any type of equipment can lead to bad connections which
  can cause all sorts of problems.
</ul>
<p>
Where any type of failure occurs, don't just replace the obviously blown
parts.  Check everything in the vicinity as well.  Replace anything that is
questionable even if not an outright failure.  Make sure all your (or
someone else's) connections are secure using lock washers for screws and
bolts, a proper tool for crimps, and an adequate iron or gun for soldered
connections.  When powering up after such an 'event' proceed as you would
for a brand-new or newly constructed power supply.
<p>

</ul>
<h3><A NAME="apsrep1">Troubleshooting Check List</A></h3>

Portions of the following come from the Omnichrome 150R power supply manual
and slightly modified to be more general:
<p>
Before beginning a lengthy troubleshooting session, check the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Are all the connectors secure?  Look for burnt/lose/damaged pins.  Reseat
 all connectors just to be sure.
<p>
<li>Is there AC power to the laser system?  Is it the correct voltage?
 On some power supplies, a small decrease in line voltage can make the
 difference between stable and erratic or no operation.
<p>
<li>Is there power at the laser head (LED on)?
<p>
<li>Is there anything blocking cooling air flow to the power supply or laser
 head (which would activate the thermal protection devices)?
<p>
<li>Is the beam block closed or something else blocking the laser beam?
<p>
<li>Did you wait long enough from initial turn-on (typically 2-3 minutes for
 filament preheat and tube start)?
<p>
<li>Are all the interlocks closed?
</ol>
<p>
Two types of problems are common:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Complete failure: No output beam, laser will not start, laser shuts off
  or cycles on and off.
<p>
<li>Low laser output.  If the discharge current is correct, this must be a
  fault with the tube or resonator (mirror) alignment.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="apsrep2">Troubleshooting Where There is No Beam at All</A></h3>

<ol>
<li>Check to make sure that power is on and interlocks are closed.  Go through
 the normal startup sequence - give it enough time!
<p>
<li>Where power and interlocks check out, see if the discharge is present - the
 tube has started.  This can be done by checking the current monitor or test
 points, or by placing a white card in front of the output coupler or mirror
 of the Ar/Kr ion tube.  Even if there is no laser beam, there should be a
 diffuse purple glow from the discharge itself.
<p>
 WARNING: Do not put your eyeball (or any other part of you!) near the tube.
 Aside from the high voltage, there is considerable UV which isn't any good
 for organic matter either!
<p>
<li>If there is a discharge and it is at a sufficient current for laser action
 to take place, either the mirror alignment is off or the optical surfaces
 are dirty, damaged, or contaminated (external mirror lasers only).
<p>
 If under light control, the current will likely be pegged at the maximum
 (e.g., 10 A) attempting to get a proper power beam.
<p>
 Check the mirror alignment and/or clean and/or realign the resonator as
 appropriate.  See the sections: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking and
 Correcting Mirror Alignment of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> or
 <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argail">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Cleaning and
 Alignment Techniques</A> (external mirror tubes) depending on the type of
 laser tube in your system.
<p>
<li>If plasma is flashing off and on (at about a 1 second or so rate), line
 voltage (or your Variac) may be too low or there may be a problem with
 the regulator or its control circuitry.
<p>
<li>If there is no discharge, this can be due to a bad main supply, regulator,
 starter, or any of the supply voltages used to run these.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Check for main DC+ at the output of the line rectifier/filter network.
 <li>Check for the (boost) supply to the igniter and its oscillator.
 <li>Check voltages to the logic and analog circuitry.
 <li>Check the tube filament voltage (and that the filament is glowing).
 </ul>
<p>
 WARNING: Some or all of these power supplies are line connected - take
 extreme care with measurements!  See the section:
 <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apssaf">SAFETY when Dealing with Ar/Kr Ion Laser
 Power Supplies</A>.
<p>
<li>If all voltages are present and there are no signs of arcing, listen for
 the 'tick-tick-tick' of the igniter.  If this is present, the igniter is
 probably working.
<p>
 If there is no evidence of the tick-tick-tick sound, check the (Boost)
 supply directly at the igniter circuit.
<p>
 It is also possible to test the output of the igniter by disconnecting it
 from the tube (with power off and everything discharged!) and then powering
 up and checking that it will arc 1/3" to 1/2" to a suitable ground point.
<p>
 For more on startup and igniter faults, see the sections:
 <A HREF="laserasc.htm#ascom18">Omni-150 Power-Up Sequence and
 Troubleshooting</A> and <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrcct7">Igniter Problems and
 Troubleshooting</A>.
<p>
<li>If the igniter is working, put a piece of white paper in front of the laser
 output port.  If there are momentary flashes of diffuse purple or laser
 light but the discharge does not remain on, turn the light control to its
 maximum setting.  If the discharge still does not stay on (or there were no
 flashes of light), the Ar/Kr ion tube may be faulty or the regulator is
 cutting out.
<p>
 Where the power supply and igniter check out, the tube pressure may be too
 high (from non-use) or the tube may be misbehaving just because it felt like
 it - but this may be reversible.  It may be possible to the tube to start
 using an Oudin coil and then run it for several hours to drive down the
 pressure.  See the section: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrctt2">Hard-to-Start
 Ar/Kr Ion Tubes - Outgassing and Keeping Your Laser Healthy</A>.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="apsrep3">Troubleshooting Where There is No or Low Output</A></h3>

Check the mirror alignment and/or clean and/or realign the resonator as
appropriate.  See the sections: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir0">Checking and
Correcting Mirror Alignment of Internal Mirror Laser Tubes</A> or
<A HREF="laserarg.htm#argail">Argon/Krypton Ion Laser Cleaning and
Alignment Techniques</A> (external mirror tubes) depending on the type of
laser tube in your system.

<h3><A NAME="apsrep4">Troubleshooting Linear Pass-Banks</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I cannot stress enough the need to have a curve tracer around, even a
home-built one, for checking pass-bank transistors in-circuit.  However, the
following procedure using only a multimeter will also work for identifying bad
transistors in the Lexel-88 (or most any other) pass-bank in-circuit (where
all the collectors are tied together) is:
<ol>
<li>Turn the power off AND MAKE SURE THE MAIN FILTER CAPACITORS ARE DISCHARGED!
<p>
<li>Set your multimeter on low ohms and measure from each emitter lead to the
   collector.
<p>
<li>Establish an average from unit to unit, as he emitter resistors isolate you
   from the others and the bad transistor will usually be a short or sometimes
   an open.  You'll see something like 23-23-44-23-24-23.2-12-23-23.3.  The 12
   and 44 Ohms are the bad ones provided all the transistors are the same type
   in the pass-bank.
<p>
<li>Replacement transistors should be of the same type and matched for Hfe if
  possible.  Otherwise, depending on the design of the driver circuits, the
  collector currents could end up being seriously unequal despite any emitter
  current balancing resistors.  This may result in significantly unequal stress
  (current and thus power dissipation) leading to spectacular failures!
<p>
<li>After installation, check for proper current balancing under load.
</ol>
<p>
That's also why the Lexel has the 'stress' meter on the pass-bank.  If the
meter won't get out of the 10 to 30 Volt range, there is a shorted pass-bank
transistor.  The correct 'green' range is 10 to 70 volts.  For a combination
of a power supply configuration and Ar/Kr ion tube that should work, selecting
the proper tap on the line input buck/boost transformer will aid in getting
the transistors operating in the right range and is the first thing to check
when firing up the laser.

<h3><A NAME="apsmatc">Matching Pass-Bank Devices</A></h3>

When a catastrophic failure occurs in an ion laser power supply, multiple
bipolar transistors or power MOSFETs in the pass-bank devices are often
destroyed.  When replacing them, obtaining matched devices - and matched to
any that survived - is generally desirable.  How important this may be will
depend on both the circuit design and the type of device.  Where there are
current balancing resistors, matching is a lot less critical.  However, when
the devices are simply connected in parallel (C/E or D/S), matching will
probably be needed, especially with bipolar transistors.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bipolar transistors have a negative temperature coefficient.  With
 directly paralleled devices, matching is critical because since as the
 temperature increases, any current imbalance that exists will get worse
 resulting in a thermal runaway situation.  Small resistors in series with
 the emitters are generally included to counteract this but using matched
 devices is still a good idea.
<p>
<li>MOSFETs have a positive temperature coefficient.  With directly paralleled
 devices, the MOSFET that carries the most current will tend to heat the most
 and its current will decrease.  So, there is some degree of automatic
 current balancing that takes place.  Matching is still desirable but not
 as critical as with bipolar devices.
</ul>
<p>
In all cases, it's still desirable to obtain matched devices, or at least
devices from the same batch number.  When purchasing from a large electronics
distributor, there is a very good chance any specific order will be filled
with parts from the same batch.  It may also be possible to request them
and/or order (likely at a higher price) devices matched to some specific
requirements.  Replacing all of them may also be prudent even if some test
good since they may have been overstressed and could then be the weak link,
blowing themselves and everything else shortly after your repair.

<h3><A NAME="apsomni">Omni-150P Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply Repair
 Saga</A></h3>

I was offered an Omnichrome model 150P-M power supply at a decent price in
unknown condition (I assumed dead and wasn't disappointed in this regard).
But at least there were no obvious craters or signs of conflagration on the
outside :-).
<p>
Yes, I can tell what you are thinking: "The designer of the SG-IL1 whimps out
and buys a commercial power supply." :)
<p>
The Omni-150P is virtually identical to the Omni-150R (I have been informed
that it is basically the same design but with a different PCB layout and use
of a commercial current sensing transformer/Hall sensor instead of the
custom one used in the 150P.  There were also a few choice expletives in the
description but none affecting performance.)  The schematic I have is close
enough in any case (as such things go) for troubleshooting.
<p>
The seller even agreed to include the most likely components to have blown -
the power MOSFETs in the main chopper.  So, what the heck, it will make a nice
toy and provide much information for the FAQ!
<p>
The replaies are from Steve Roberts.
<p>
I received the Omni PS from Dave.  It, to put it mildly, needs some work :-(.
<p>
Dave sent along replacement MOSFETs - the originals had been pulled as had
the snubber diode (D21), and all socketed ICs except the CD4040.   So, I need
to find replacement for those.  The power supply cooling fan is also missing.
<p>
It is also kind of beat up.
<p>
While not totally disappointed, this isn't quite what I expected.
<p>
When I asked Dave about its condition originally (back when I made the
decision to buy it), he had indicated that it was given to him along with
another similar power supply to test a head, and he hadn't tried this supply
at all since the other one worked.  Now, perhaps, someone had eviscerated it
before he got a hold of it but at least part of its state would be quite
obvious from the outside.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
This is the normal condition of used laser equipment, and if there are no
scorches, your lucky. Knowing Dave quite well, if he had the chipsets,
you'd get them, he's not that kind of guy.  Odds are somebody did a amateur
hour attempted repair on them with out a schematic or scope, which is
suicide, then Dave got the job to resurrect one for the club that uses it in
a projector. So now you get to play detective, finding what was originally
wrong and finding the new added problems. 
<p>
Does it smell like pot smoke or cigarettes? Its usually one or the
other, if its the later, clean the covers and fins good as they usually
have high levels of nicotine oil on them, as a club laser is near the
ceiling and sucks all the smoke through its cooling ducts and the PSU. Its
highly toxic in such concentrated form  if your sweating. I speak from a
personally blinding experience. Temporary but scary. :-(
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Actually, inside it is quite clean - dusty, but no great gobs of nasty
coatings.  I don't know if I would recognize pot smoke residue but it just
smells like old electronics - not burnt, just dusty.  I spray painted the
outside now so it doesn't look too bad there either :-).
<p>
There is even dust on the empty sockets so I assume it has been like this for
quite a while.
<p>
I haven't tested anything on it yet but at least there aren't any obvious
scorch marks or holes blown through the circuit board!
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
The PWM chip is $3.40 at Digikey or about $6.50 at any place that sells the
ECG or NTE line of TV repair parts, and the op-amps are no more then $1.95 at
Radio Shack.
<p>
Speaking from experience, you usually need to replace the op-amps and PWM chip
anyways for sanity reasons. You have no idea what the last guy did his
measurements with, possibly something destructive like a MEGGER :-).   This
is a mission critical unit, and its better to replace than miss something
stressed and have it pop again. 
<p>
First stop: The +15 and -15 V regulators, 95% of the time its one of them
has let out its precious internal smoke and one of the microfuses (look
for olive drab,  chartreuse, or cyan unmarked resistors) is popped, these
are generally 3/4 amp picofuses.  This surge takes out a op-amp or two, but the
discrete parts are usually fine, save for the MOSFETs and fast diode. The
MOSFETs are usually $17 to $24 each.
<p>
If a picofuse is popped, look at the 110 V and anode leads where they go
onto the board, odds are these are misconnected, either that or the
external fan wires were shorted.  There are a couple of possible
combinations, but only one works and doesn't pop a fuse.
<p>
REMEMBER TO ISOLATE YOUR SCOPE AND DMM FROM GROUND USING A PROPER
ISOLATION TRANSFORMER OR A ISOLATED SCOPE OR BATTERIES.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yep, God knows I have enough warnings in the FAQ about this!  I was actually
thinking of hooking up a couple of big transformers I have back-to-back as
an isolation transformer for the duration.
<p>
Actually, for initial testing until I actually fire the tube, my small
isolation transformer should be fine.
<p>
I think I will also rewire the fan for operation off the -15 (4 diodes to drop
it to 12 V) for a DC fan - I assume the one in there was for 115 VAC - not
easy to find in my junk box.
<p>
Didn't you also mention a cap that blows along with that stuff?
<p>
Assuming it matches the <A HREF="150rpsch.gif">Omni-150R - Power
Subsystem</A>, which cap would it be?  C35? Why would that blow? Or is there
another one I missed?  Or is it C27 which I couldn't really determine from
the schematics you sent?
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
Yep, its the electrolytic snubber in the PWM circuit, 200 to 300 uF if I
remember right, C35 on your schematic. I can't remember ever seeing two the
these supplies that are exactly the same, usually the changes are minor.
Check the components around the PWM chip, see if it matches, other then
that you should be fine.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The Cyonics tube will be fine for testing and I won't worry too much about
damaging it.  I never did get it to lase with my pulsed power supply, maybe
with a real one it will do better but it does have a bad case of cathode
sag....
<p>
Note: This was before I had succeeded in getting the Cyonics tube working with
SG-IX1.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
See if you can get a hene beam down it cleanly.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I did that.  I checked mirror alignment best I could with a long baseline
HeNe setup.  Yes, I know, not really valid (at least at one end because of
wedge) but it was TOO perfect by any test I could perform to totally write if
off.  I did try torquing the mirror mounts at each end in all directions
while it was pulsing - nadda.  Current was well above threshold (probably
peaked at 15 A) for a millisecond or more.....
<p>
Yes, I know, it should have worked.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
Ah, perhaps a millisecond is too short to establish a stable plasma,
pulsed lasers are usually filled about 1/10 to 1/100th of the fill pressure
of a cw unit. in a week or two you'll be able to ram 11 amps down that tube
if you want to.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
HeHeHe... More likely with a space heater supply and your ignite board :-).
Things don't happen THAT quickly around here!  I wish. :-)
<p>
Let's see.... I was running a 200 uF cap with a 15 ohm ballast if I recall
correctly - probably more like 3 ms.
<p>
P.S. Will the ignite board alone produce laser pulses on a 60X?  What is the
pulse length when you get a tube like the NEC that doesn't start but produces
pulsed laser output (as with Ben's)?
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
A 60X will generate a faint pulse with just the ignite board and boost,
that's how I tell if the anode voltage isn't there, it's just a faint click,
only a faint whiff of lasing on higher power tubes, however if you have anode
volts it's a banging or popping sound and a long bright flash if it doesn't
start. If its faint you'll see a flash of purple from the plasma in a dark
room. 
<p> 
Like I have said in the past, it would not surprise me if that pulse is 250 to
500 mW at its peak.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Well, the ignite board and boost is a pulse of unknown width and RF content
from the SCR discharge and 5 uF at 500 V or so discharging into a short
circuit :-) so that should be pretty brief.
<p>
If the anode supply is live, I would guess you get some follow through on
that to lengthen the pulse even if it doesn't catch?
<p>
HeHeHe, I found the op-amps and PWM chip at Mouser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>TL074ACN - $1.10
<li>SG3525AN - $.78
</ul>
<p>
Hope these are real prices!
<p>
I can't find that diode (D21 - MUR1560) at MCM, Digikey, or Mouser.
<p>
I discovered another pair of smoked resistors - R4 and R5 - pullups to
the PWM drive. :-(.  It may be the only one actually fried but the other
was in a somewhat sorry state - both measured correctly however.
<p>
Also, D11 and D19 have been replaced with a single diode - there may be other
changes in that area as well.

My 12 VDC fan is now running happily off of the -15 V supply through 4
diodes. :-)  It only draws .125 A so the 7915 regulator should handle it
easily - while the circuitry for the positive and negative supplies are
similar, there is less of a load on the -15 V (since the relays are powered
from the positive supply) so there should be ample margin.  I added the
following circuit off of the 7915:

The purpose of C1 and C2 are to prevent any fan motor switching noise from
propagating BACK to the analog power supply.
<p>
I have disconnected the controller AC from everything else so will be able to
troubleshoot it without worrying too much about Hot AC and meltdowns!
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
The last diodes I bought were from Digikey, IXYS makes a equivalent, so does
IR, it's a 20 to 100 nS diode.  The driver resistors are always smoked but
functional, in every unit I've ever seen. Usually somebody monkeys with the
clamp diodes on the hot side of the driver.  Most people assume they are
shorting out the driver, when in fact they are a pulse forming network, so
take a look there as well.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
OK, I found some IXYS diodes in Digikey: The most likely options are: 14A,
35 ns, 600 V or 17A, 40 ns, 600 V.  MUR1560 which is what was on the schematic
is 600 V, 15 A 35/60 ns (whatever that "/" means).
<p>
My Mouser order arrived - replaced the 220 uF, 250 V cap and the 10 uF 350 V
one as well just for good measure.  I have 5 each of the SG3525AN and TL074ACN.
count 'em!  I am now ready to fire up (hopefully not literally!) the control
subsystem with the power circuitry disconnected (and the MOSFETs and D21 not
even installed).
<p>
I see that R30 in this unit is 150 ohm, 5 W instead of the 330 ohms listed on
my Omni-150R schematic.  Hmmmm.
<p>
And, someone has jumper/bypassed the filament tap switch - it tests bad (no
continuity in any position) so I will remove it and replace with a machined
pin IC socket and insulated 2 pin male jumper.
<p>
I have now set the mainboard up so that power is applied only to the low
voltage power supply transformer via a Variac on an isolation transformer!
<p>
Anyhow, after confirming that the pinout made sense, I plugged in an SG3525
(without any op-amps) to see what would happen. 
<p>
Fortunately, I still have some ancient DIP clips that fit 14 and 16 pin ICs!
<p>
Poking around its pins shows nothing of interest except on pins 5 and 7 which
have a ~100 KHz sawtooth and pin 16 which has 5.1 V - this is promising.
However, there is only a pegged at +15 rail voltage on pin 13, the output.
OK, so maybe the op-amps are needed to at least provide a valid input signal.
What the heck - in go the TL074s (after confirming the +/-15 V power to their
sockets).
<p>
Now, I have a reasonable looking signal from pin 13 and a similar drive signal
on TP2.  Although I don't have the control panel hooked up, I assume this
corresponds to the Standby preset pulse width setting.
<p>
Next, as a change of pace, I want to see if the Preheat Timer - the CD4040 - is
functional.  An initial test seems to show no activity here but then I realize
it will only do something with the interlock chain grounded.  Since this is
normally provided via the control cable, I add a jumper from pin 11 to pin 8
of the CD4040.  At first I thought it was still dead but then I heard the main
relay (RLY1) kick in - just about 30 seconds after applying power.  Sure
enough, completing the interlock after applying power results in a 30 second
delay and then relay activation.  There is something a bit strange about the
behavior - the order of things matters - but that may be normal.  It basically
works.
<p>
So I sent some email to Steve:
<p>
Greetings:
<p>
I installed my PWM and op-amp chips.  Running with the mainboard by itself
(with only the low voltage power supply transformer powered via a Variac
through an isolation transformer :-) I have drive pulses on TP2 at about
100 KHz I think and the preheat timer seems to work enabling RLY1 after 30
second - though it doesn't always appear to reset properly by just interrupting
the interlock chain.
<p>
Do you have any advice on minimizing the chance of blowing expensive MOSFETs?
I haven't installed Q8/9 or D21 yet.  I know - don't try to power a resistive
load, use a real tube.  What about adding a light bulb or space heater in
series with the power feed to limit current?  What blows these MOSFETs besides
trying to deliver 10+ amps into a short circuit?
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
What kills 150s are: Back spikes from heads with no blocking diode, and bad
MUR1560 diode.  If you inject a signal to the PWM chip does the duty cycle
change?  Have you set the initial voltages and 40% PWM duty cycle up yet?  
<p>
The blocking diode is a 11RA90 or similar in series with the tube.
They are traditionally big heavy can diodes for two reasons: (1) They
seem to survive much better then plastic packages, and (2) they can handle
the CW 10 amps passing through. 
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I'm pretty much ready to fire this thing up (hopefully not literally) but still
need to find some TOP3 size mica insulators for the MOSFETs.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[How time flies... 2000,2001,2002,2003,2004]
<p>
Well, approximately 5 years (yep, you read that correctly) have passed and
I've still not gotten around to doing anything more with this power supply.
So, I whimped out and when I mentioned to Dave (ws407c@aol.com) that I'd
happily let him have it on permanent loan as a challenge, he jumped at the
offer.  Yes, I can tell what you are thinking now: "The author of the
chapter on ion laser power supply repair whimps out and lets someone
else repair his power supply." :)  Well, so be it. :-)
<p>
Here is what he found:
<p>
<ul>
<li>There were many cold solder joints.  I had never really carefully
 inspected for failures like this but it's a good thing that someone did!
<p>
<li>The 1,000 turn winding of the current sense transformer was blown open,
 apparently from an arc that also charred the PCB beneath it.  We still
 have no idea under what conditions such an arc could develop.  Fortunately,
 the open was found just 15 turns in from the end so repair was easy.
 Q7 in the vicinity was also found to be dead and was replaced.
<p>
<li>A matched pair of 47 ohm resistors were installed for the gate drive and
 positioned well off the PCB since that area was somewhat charred as well.
<p>
<li>Dave didn't like my fan kludge so he installed a fan of the same
 type as the original, noting that it would be louder. :)
<p>
<li>Dave also didn't like may substituting socket pins for the filament
 tap switch but couldn't offer anything better, so he just found a jumper
 wire that was really snug in there.  How often does one bother changing
 this anyhow?
<p>
<li>And, I sent him some crimp terminals and a 0.025" insulator sheet
 to replace the missing one underneath the PCB.
</ul>
<p>
Dave double checked compatibility on the power semiconductors and found
that the HFA15TB60 fast recovery diode which I installed is an excellent
substitute.  And the IXTH24N50's are perfect as they are stock in newer
Omni-150.  Dave's old 150 has IXTH15N45As in the schematic of the
Omni-150R (<A HREF="150rpsch.pdf">Omni-150R - Power Subsystem</A>)
lists IXTH24N45s so we know of 3 different parts that will work without
question.  In case anybody trying to find parts has trouble. The IXTH24N50s
are currently produced but we cannot find specs on the earlier ones on
the <A HREF="http://www.ixys.com/">IXYS</A> Web site and are probably
discontinued.  The original MUR1560 is nowhere to be found.
<p> 
And that, as they say, is that.  Dave powered it up and tweaked the
adjustments, setting idle current and current limit to 4.5 and 9 A,
respectively.  It's apparently been run for more than 8 hours at
this point without incident.
<p>
Despite mildly protesting, Dave sent the power supply back to me so for the
first time in at least 5 years, my 60X laser head is being powered correctly.
With multiline optics, it's nothing to write home about - only perhaps 20 mW
at 9 A with a strange doughnut beam, the power supply works well.  Thank
you Dave. :)  Now I need to find a decent laser head to go with it!

<h2>Pulsed Operation of Ion Tubes and Test Circuits</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apspit0">Pulsed Operation of an Ar/Kr Ion Tube</A></h3>

Ion laser tubes designed for continuous (CW) operation cannot really be
run in very high peak power pulsed mode (greatly above their CW ratings),
at least not for very long.
<p>
You'd need a very high voltage source (like 5 to 10 kV or more) to charge
a fairly large capacitor to get them to lase cold cathode.  Plus, a spark gap
or thyratron switch to keep the tube from just glowing.  Aside from
running a high chance of poping the glass to metal seals on every
pulse, the sputtering and gas cleanup will kill it rather quickly. You're
also going to see discharge down the gas returns on Spectra-Physics tubes
(at least).  And once the discharge goes down the returns once, it rarely
returns to the bore.  That hot cathode makes a world of difference in
getting a good clean arc.
<p>
And, even though the metal end-bell might look tempting to use as a large
area cathode, this really isn't a viable option.  It isn't heated, so the
sputtering at high current will be very severe, rapidly coating everything
with a metallic coating.  Consider that a HeNe laser tube runs at
only a few mA, not 10s of AMPs.  And, when the cathode coating in HeNe
laser tubes is depleted, even this low current results in a sputter
overcoat in a few hours of operation.
<p>
Tubes designed for pulsed operation run at 1/10th to 1/100th of the pressure
in their CW counterparts.  The gas cleanup rate is huge.
<p>
If pulsed output is desired, keep the cathode hot and simmer the tube with
a low current arc, then flare up the current when you need it?  That's the
way some medical systems work, and it's a lot easier on the tube.

<h3><A NAME="apspit0a">Pulsed Testing of an Ion Laser Tube</A></h3>

For the following, it is assumed that the filament is properly heated and
that the peak current is well within the acceptable range for the specific
tube.
<p>
For determining if a new or used ion tube is good, there may be no need to
run it on a full blown power supply.  That way, you can hold off committing
the time, money, and other resources to obtain or build one until you know
that you have a working tube.  (Once you read the chapter:
<A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdtoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser Power Supply Design</A> you will
know why this is worth considering - these are not like little HeNe types!)
A simple pulsed circuit created using the tube as the active device in a
relaxation oscillator will suffice.  This has a number of other attractive
benefits as well:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Safety - The personal risks of operating this relatively high voltage but
 low current power supply are far fewer than with a line-connected godzilla
 sized monster capable of sustained kW output!
<p>
<li>Simplicity - This tester can be constructed using any of the approaches for
 providing the operating voltage for small HeNe lasers.  The circuit shown
 below assumes an inverter running on a low voltage DC input but a line
 powered transformer feeding a rectifier or doubler will work equally well.
 In may even be possible to use an existing HeNe laser power supply (or tap
 off from inside of one) for this purpose.  See the chapter:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdtoc">HeNe Laser Power Supply Design</A>.
<p>
<li>Much reduced heat dissipation - Only the filament of the Ar/Kr ion tube
 will be generating any heat to speak of (typically about 50 W) so minimal
 cooling will be adequate - a small PC style cooling fan will be more than
 adequate.  However, see below, for possible problems resulting from the tube
 running this cool.
<p>
<li>Less chance of damaging the Ar/Kr ion tube - This circuit can be left
 pulsing away for reasonable length of time without harm to the tube of any
 kind since it is current limited and should have much less of an effect
 on tube life than the normal igniter.
</ul>
<p>
However, there are several caveats:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Just because you get a pulse doesn't mean its enough to lase.  Both the
 peak current its duration over the lasing threshold must be adequate.  Without
 swapping in a tube of exactly the same type that is known to be functional
 (and seeing it produce a coherent output), there is no real way to be sure
 that your suspect tube's refusal to perform isn't due to some artifact of
 the pulsed drive.
<p>
<li>If the tube had single line (e.g., 514.5 or 457 nm) optics, or it is an
 older used tube, this circuit might not hit it hard enough to get enough
 gain on those lines.
<p>
<li>The mirrors have been tuned (at the factory for internal mirror tubes) when
 the resonator is hot and will be slightly misaligned when running cool.
 Therefore, higher peak currents than the tube specs would indicate may be
 needed to produce any output.
<p>
<li>I cannot endorse changing the mirror positions on a sealed mirror tube
 without a normal power supply.  It is just to shaky both because the tube is
 running cool and because the relatively slow pulse rate makes adjusting for
 optimal mirror position much more difficult.
</ul>
<p>
WARNING: Despite the low pulse rate and short pulse duration, the optical
output from the laser running on these circuits could be enough to result in
eye damage.  For example, a 60X at startup may produce almost a half watt of
peak laser output power for a brief period as the igniter and multiplier caps
discharge into the tube - which is a similar situation to what is presented
here (especially when you decide to increase the value of the storage
capacitors to boost output!) - and it is banging away at the tube repeatedly!
Take care and NEVER look down the tube bore while the circuit is active - even
if it appears to be dead as a brick!
<p>
Argon ion lasers have been built to operate in pulsed mode. See, for example
US Patent 3,555,451, granted January 12, 1971 (this may be too old for some
of the on-line databases).  Output was 6 W peak/2 mW average pulsed at 60 Hz
A design that builds on this one can be found in
in <b>U.S. Patent #3,967,214: Stabilizing Electrode for Cold Cathode Gas Ion
Laser</b>.
<p>
Having gotten that out of the way, here are several circuits that should be
adequate for a typical small air-cooled Ar/Kr ion tube.

This circuit forms a relaxation oscillator using the tube as the discharge

</PRE>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the proper filament voltage and current.  For a small tube like the
 Cyonics, the voltage should be set to 3 VAC once the filament has warmed up
 (about 30 to 45 seconds).  A little less is fine as well for this low power
 pulsed operation.
<p>
<li>Determine the breakdown voltage of the tube by monitoring the voltage
 across it as you gradually increase the input to your HV power supply.
 This value will typically be between 1.5 and 3 kV a small to medium size
 tube.  Select R2 (the current limiting resistor) so that the peak current
 at the time of discharge is less than the maximum rating for your tube.
 For example, where the tube has a breakdown voltage of 1.5 kV and is rated
 at 10 A and 100 VDC, R2 = (1,500-100)/10 or about 140 ohms.  A little less
 resistance (slightly higher current) is fine as well since the duty cycle
 will be so low.
<p>
<li>R1 to R3 should be made of series strings lower value resistors to be happy
 at voltages up to 3 kV.
<p>
<li>Include a 1 ohm sense resistor (Rs) in the return path to monitor the
 current on an oscilloscope (1 V/A sensitivity).
</ul>
<p>
This will form a relaxation oscillator using the tube with current limiting
to about 10 A.  Adjust the pulse rate by either varying the input voltage
or changing R1 (with power off!).
<p>
Running this at a few pulses per second for a reasonable length of time (i.e.,
not for days on end) should result in no significant damage to the tube or
shorten its life by any detectable amount.  You shouldn't need to run it this
way for very long in any case - just don't think that this setup can be used
in place of a REAL power supply!
<p>
As long as the peak current exceeds the tube's lasing threshold, there should
be visible flashes of laser light from its OC (output coupler) end if it is
working and aligned correctly.
<p>
WARNING: This circuit is still dangerous - just less so than a full blown ion
laser power supply.  The anode of the tube (including the mirror mount at that
end!) will have a voltage of up to 1.5 kV with respect to ground (for this
example).  While the amount of energy stored in C1 is fairly small - less than
0.5 J (W-s), it can still be lethal under the wrong conditions.  The HV power
supply itself can deliver up to 5 mA through R1.  Either of these are at least
enough to evoke a reflex response which may ruin your whole day even they do
not kill you.  Take care.
<p>
Note: I show the entire setup earth grounded including the tube cooling fins
and support structure.  This makes it safe to touch everything BUT the tube
anode (and of course, the HV power supply).  Floating the entire affair is
also possible but most of the same problems exist since portions of the tube
will still be at the negative potential of the power supply and, if you use
the scope monitor points across Rs, will be grounded through the scope (unless
you isolate that as well - which is not recommended).

<h4><A NAME="apspit2">Ar/Kr Ion Tube Pulse Test Circuit 2</A></h4>

The following circuit is a somewhat more powerful alternative and there are
absolutely no safety claims for it!  With the relatively large energy storage
capacitors for C3 and C4, it must be treated with great respect.
<p>
It may also be possible to use this approach for starting small to medium size
tubes since it provides a 'boost' voltage like that used by the igniter of the
ALC-60X/Omni-532, SG-IT1, and SG-IL1.  See the section:
<A HREF="laseraps.htm#apspit0">Pulsed Operation of an Ar/Kr Ion Tube</A>.
<p>
What this design provides is two power supplies driven from a single 650 VRMS
center-tapped transformer (T3).  Many other approaches for the power sources
are possible.  See the chapter: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpstoc">HeNe Laser Power Supplies</A> for ideas.
<p>
<ul>
<li>A high voltage low current source which is used to start the tube and also
 determines the pulse rate.  This forms a relaxation oscillator using the
 tube as the discharge device in a similar manner to the circuit described
 in the section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apspit1">Ar/Kr Ion Tube Pulse Test
 Circuit 1</A>.
<p>
<li>A medium voltage source with your favorite size storage capacitors (75uF
 shown here) to provide a current to the tube once it starts.  D7 blocks the
 high voltage but allows C3/C4 to discharge through it once the tube starts.
<p>
 Note that D7 can be built from 4, 1000 V, 2.5 A diodes in series since the
 single cycle (pulse) rating for these is much higher than the approximately
 10 A (15 A without the regulator) peak that is required.
<p>
 The (optional) constant current regulator allows the tube current to be set
 at a high but safe value.  If a simple resistor is used, either the current
 would be lower than desired for most of the discharge, or higher than the
 maximum tube specs for some portion of it.  If you don't use a regulator,
 change R2 to 33 ohms at 10 W (for 12 A peak).

<p>
Setup and operation is similar to that described in the section: <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apspit1">Ar/Kr Ion
Tube Pulse Test Circuit 1</A>.  Adjust T2 to obtain the proper filament voltage
for your tube and modify the value of R1 to vary the pulse rate.
<p>
The remaining details are left as an exercise for the student!  A switchmode
buck converter will be needed for the optional regulator unless you have a
bank of really high power transistors gathering dust in your junk box. :-)
The problem with using a linear regulator is the peak power dissipation and
keeping inside the SOA (Safe Operating Region) for the transistor(s).  A
common BUT12A would handle the current and voltage individually for this
example but not the peak 4,000 WATTs - 400 V AND 10 A at the same time!
<p>
WARNING: Take care as C3 and C4 can pack quite a wallop - especially once you
increase their size - as I know you will. ;-)  And, both supplies can deliver
dangerous levels of current continuously even without the capacitors!
<p>
An alternative which may work for some small tubes like the Cyonics (those
which will start without help from a boost source) is to use a line powered
(non-isolated or 1:1 isolation transformer) supply for the pulse current
source followed by an (optional) linear or switchmode regulator.
<p>
Without the regulator, it would look like the following:

<h4><A NAME="apspit3">Ar/Kr Ion Tube Pulse Test Circuit 3</A></h4>

Finally, here is another pulse circuit with an organization very similar to
that of many HeNe power supplies (see the chapter: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe Laser Power
Supply Schematics</A>).
<p>
A 600 VCT power transformer (T2) charges the energy storage capacitor (C1) to
approximately 425 VDC and also drives the parasitic voltage multiplier to
generate an additional starting voltage of up to more than 2,500 VDC.  When
the Ar/Kr ion tube starts, C1 discharges through D9 with a current limited to
about 10 A by R3.  The uF value of C1 may be changed to provide the desired
discharge energy.  Adjust the values of R2 and/or C3 to assure that C1 charges
in a shorter time than it takes for the HV to build up to the point at which
the tube starts.
<p>
My first version of this circuit was built as an all-on to a 30 year old
home-brew tube-type bench power supply (remember the 5U4GB rectifier tube?).
I never thought I would ever find a use for that again but it did have all the
connections required to attach the output and voltage multiplier conveniently
located on front panel binding posts!

Like the other pulse supplies, this can also be used as a starter for some
small ion tubes.  All that is needed is a high voltage high current blocking
diode between the ion tube anode and the DC+ output of a the normal ion laser
power supply.

<h2>Miscellaneous Ion Laser Power Supply Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="apsawrp">About the Wide Range of Power Supply
 Characteristics</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
All laser PSUs work over a much wider range then the tube needs, to
accommodate for tube wear. No two tubes ship with exactly the same operating
characteristics due to minor differences in the cathode, gas pressure,
bore size, and Brewster window quality.  So the PSU is built wide range to
accommodate them all. Often the same PSU is designed to work a whole series
of head models over a wide power range. It's desirable that the PSU cover a
wide range in case your tube is high pressure and hard starting. It also
helps in diagnosing problems if you can sweep your tube over a wide range
of currents.  Short periods of low current wont hurt it, but attempting to
start at low currents is very hard on the tube and PSU. Running forever at
below rated idle current will damage a tube as fast as overcurrent. 
<p>
So you need to hit the magic number, amps-wise. For example a SP-168 likes to
run at 30 to 35 amps, but not much below 25 amps, then you're doing damage,
and 40 amps is way into overcurrent, but the PSU can ram 45 amps into the
tube if the tube is new and you don't mind buying pass-bank transistors
often.   
<p>
There are also some cases in the lab when you need to dial down a laser,
either to get it going in "single mode" oscillation or to reduce background
noise in the beam, at a known sacrifice of tube life. Also some lines are
sensitive to both magnetic field and current, at a certain product of I x B
they drop out of lasing.  So you need a wide range.  For example, on the
krypton yellow, green, and deep violet lines. 
<p>
At the other extreme, overcurrent: For example, my Lexel-88 argon ion laser
with its brand new tube can sustain 3.5 watts (21 amps) for a very short
period of time, then drop back to idle at 10 A.  But, at about 9.5 A it drops
below lasing threshold, and at 9 A or so the discharge is highly unstable and
probably is damaging the tube.   Nominal running range is a watt at 13 to 15
amps. But it was designed as a pulsed eye surgery laser, and thus needs a wide
range of available power.  On the back of the PSU is a duty cycle warning
saying at a 5% duty cycle I can way overcurrent the tube without much damage.
1000 hours from now based on past experience with other tubes, I'd need 18 to
19 A or more to sustain a CW power of one watt and could not obtain anywhere
near the 3.5 watts, as the cathode would be depleted and the pressure would be
low and internal dust on the Brewsters would be obscuring much of the beam. 
hence the wide PSU range.
