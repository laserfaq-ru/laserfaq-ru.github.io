<h2>Basic Home-Built PMG Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cmgcmg0">Introduction to Home-Built PMG Laser</A></h3>

The Pulsed Multiple Gas (PMG) laser described in this chapter is very similar
in many ways to the <A HREF="lasercar.htm#cartoc">Home-Built Pulsed Argon
and/or Krypton (Ar/Kr) Ion Laser</A> from Scientific American.  However, the
developers of the PMG laser have also used it with xenon (Xe) oxygen (O2), and
even suggest that plain old ordinary air might work as well!  Though not
covered in the original reference, it is also likely that with the appropriate
mirrors, pure neon as well as other gases will lase with this same basic
setup.
<p>
Most of the major differences are with respect to the power supply.  Rather
than a simple rectified neon sign transformer and Oudin/Tesla coil trigger, it
uses a 15 kV thyratron controlled pulsar in the basic power supply and also
includes a more complex design capable of better control of pulse width and
energy.  This 'cascade' system includes a high voltage trigger and lower
voltage pulse forming network - similar in some ways to what is used to drive
a xenon strobe or solid state laser.
<p>
When used with argon or krypton, some of the same wavelengths are produced as
with normal Ar/Kr ion lasers.  I assume this to be the case with xenon as well
but I don't have any data for a xenon ion laser.  The Xe lines lase with both
the simple exciter as well as the cascade system though most of the Ar and Kr
lines require the cascade system.
<p>
I also don't know if the O2 lasing process is similar - it could very well be
a totally different mechanism being a non-noble gas diatonic molecule.  No data
is available for O2 with the cascade system.  This indicates that the O2 lines
may not lase with a wide, lower voltage pulse.  In this case, it could be
lasing in the afterglow (as has been suggested by some people) which would
only operate with the short HV pulse provided by the simple exciter's
thyratron directly.
<p>
With pure neon (Ne), the PMG laser should produce coherent light at the orange
(611.9 nm) and yellow (594.1 nm) wavelengths of the corresponding non-red HeNe
lasers.  This is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.  And, you are
of course free to try whatever other gases you desire!
<p>
The PMG laser is also very similar in many respects to the Ar/Kr ion laser
in terms of the difficulty of construction.  A flowing gas system like that
of an axial flow CO2 laser is suggested - a mechanical pump at one end of the
laser tube and a controlled gas leak valve at the other end.  A medium vacuum
system and some glass work will be needed.  However, since easily obtained (or
generated) O2 can be used, the gas handling can be much simpler than for the
Ar/Kr ion or HeNe lasers.

<h3><A NAME="cmgsaf">Home-Built PMG Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are three areas of safety considerations for the home-built PMG laser
(and other similar lasers, for that matter):
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built PMG laser may be capable of producing
 a beam with an average power of several 10s of mW at multiple wavelengths.
 Since there doesn't seem to be any hard information on the actual power
 obtainable with this or similar home-built laser designs, it is important to
 take precautions assuming a higher power until determined otherwise.  The
 authors suggest peak power of around 10 W - I don't know if this is much more
 than a guess, however.
<p>
 Avoid eye contact with the direct or reflected beam.  This includes the 4
 pairs of beams reflecting off the Brewster windows which may be quite strong.
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supplies can be lethal.  Either of the high
 voltage power supplies easily have enough voltage and current to stop a
 heart.  A .1 uF capacitor charged to 15 kV stores more than 11 joules.  The
 pulse forming network in the cascade system stores over 35 J.  Even
 if you aren't killed, the shock may startle you into doing something you might
 regret.  Make sure you read and follow the <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety
 Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment</A>.  Insulate all
 connections and install barriers to prevent contact with the high voltage.
 Where water cooling is used, these precautions are even more critical as
 water and high voltage electricity don't make a happy combination.
<p>
<li><b>Gases:</b> In particular, if you use oxygen in your laser, there is
 increased fire risk should there be a serious gas leak or regulator/metering
 valve failure resulting in atmospheric pressure O2 entering the system.
 While oxygen doesn't burn, it accelerates combustion in higher than normal
 concentrations (air has about 18 percent O2).  Materials that would normally
 be non-flammable, may burn vigorously in an O2-rich environment.  This
 includes the oil inside your vacuum pump heated and oxygen-rich during its
 compression stroke!  Take care with your gas fittings and vent any
 significant O2 directly outside.  And, no smoking in the laser lab! (Aside 
 from the stupidity of smoking on your long term health and precision optics.)
<p>
 WARNING: Do not use a high rpm direct drive type vacuum pump with pure oxygen.
 It is better and safer to use a slower rpm pump like the older Welch 1402 or
 1397 belt driven pumps.  The concern is that due to mixing of O2 with
 standard vacuum pump oil, the higher rpm pumps could, as they say, EXPLODE!
 So, a different (and very expensive) type of oil called 'Fomblin' needs to be
 used.
</ul> 

Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.
<p>

Safety</A>.  Sample safety labels which can be edited for this laser can be

and Signs</A>.

<h3><A NAME="cmgcmg1">PMG Laser Construction References and Links</A></h3>

The definitive report on lasing wavelengths found in PMG lasers may be
"Visible and uv Laser Oscillation at 118 Wavelengths in Ionized Neon,
Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Oxygen, and Other Gases", by William B. Bridges
and Arthur N. Chester, Applied Optics, vol. 4, no. 5, pp. 573-580, May 1965.
Note the date - 1965 - this isn't exactly an area of current research. :)
<p>
The following site may have some useful information, if not
explicitly for a PMG laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.pulslaser.de/">Puls Laser (German)</A>
 has virtually all of the home-built laser types including
 CO2, N2 (including TEA), ion, ruby, dye, and some that aren't covered here.
 It includes descriptions, photos, references, and other
 information.  An English translation would be most welcome as Altavista
 does less than a stellar job and doesn't follow the frame links.
</ul>
<p>
The following may be useful in conjunction with PMG power supply design:
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.kentech.co.uk/Tutorials.html">Kentech's Tutorials</A>
 includes information on transmission lines (including Blumlein types),
 pulsars, pulse forming modules, etc.)
</ul>
<p>
Much of the information in this chapter comes from the paper: "A Cold Cathode
Pulsed Gas Laser" by R. K. Lomnes and J. C. W. Taylor in: Review of Scientific
Instruments, vol 42, no. 6, June, 1971.  Thanks to
<A HREF="mailto:dlames3@msn.com">Daniel Ames</A> for to extraordinary effort
in digging out this material.
<p>
I have simplified the laser tube somewhat (more along the lines of the SciAm
designs).  The authors likely had access to a well equipped machine shop
to fabricate the flanges and what-nots for the their laser head.  So, while it
has some nice features including ease of disassembly and parts replacement -
everything is screwed together with O-ring seals and the like - more than
basic tools and metalworking skills will be needed to duplicate their design.
However, if you have access to a good machine lathe and know how to use it,
know a friendly machinist who owes you some favors, or have unlimited funds,
go for it!
<p>
I have also updated the cascade system to use a solid state rectifier
rather than the mercury vapor tube that was state-of-the-art in 1971 as well
as suggesting alternatives that do not require a thyratron.
<p>
While I cannot put this paper on-line due to copyright restrictions, I will
be happy to send a most excellent fabulous photocopy of a somewhat mediocre
photocopy (best I have, sorry) to anyone who provides a stamped self addressed
business letter size envelope.  Contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A> for instructions.
<p>
However, unless you are intent on duplicating their design exactly (or are
offering to draw the tube assembly in AutoCad to be included here), the amount
of additional solid information in the paper is quite limited.  In fact, the
amount of solid information in the paper is quite limited - period!  The
narrative is in many ways much more like that in the "Amateur Scientist"
articles of Scientific American than a true research paper.  I hope this was
due to space limitations in publishing and not to a lack of actual results.
One possible conclusion is that assuming the authors actually got the
laser to work as advertized, they knew very little about what they were doing!
<p>
In any case, the section: <A HREF=lasercmg.htm#cmgcmg3">Home-Built PMG Laser
Description</A> includes all the important dimensions, materials, and power
supply schematics so duplicating the laser in terms of function, if not style,
should be straightforward.
<p>
Another interesting and possibly relevant paper (also unearthed by Daniel) is:
"Super-Radiant Yellow and Orange Laser Transitions in Pure Neon" by
H. G. Heard and J. Peterson, Proceedings of the IEEE, Oct. 1964, vol. #52,
page #1258.  This discusses a PMG-like laser using neon which will lase
superradiantly in a narrow tube (e.g., 40 cm long x 1 mm ID) in the orange
(611.9 nm) and yellow (594.1 nm) with orange being the strongest.
Superradiant means that no mirrors are used although the addition of a
Fabry-Perot cavity does improve the lateral coherence and output power.  The
authors used a pulsed high voltage power supply for excitation (they didn't
attempt to operate the system in CW mode but speculate that it should be
possible).  So, if you have a source of neon, try that as well and report back
with your results! :)
<p>
A wealth of information can also be found on the oxygen ion laser in
<b>U.S. Patent #3,928,820 - High Gain Pulsed Ion Laser</b>.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgdolu">Daniel's Oxygen Laser</A> (near the end)
for the abstract and some of the major topics covered in the patent.
<p>
Another one worth looking at is
<b>U.S. Patent #3,646,476: Pulsed Gas Ion Laser</b>.  It has a
good description of a somewhat practical low rep rate PMG built
with Pyrex and an indium cathode.

<h3><A NAME="cmgcmg2">Some Photos of Home-Built PMG Lasers</A></h3>

Sorry, none currently available.  The links all died.
<p>
The only photo I know of is in the paper listed above.  However, my
mediocre photocopy doesn't show much (just a decent approximation of a black
smudge) and it really isn't worth the cost of postage if that's all you what!

<h3><A NAME="cmgcmg3">Home-Built PMG Laser Description</A></h3>

The PMG laser is similar in basic structure to the HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers
but is in some ways easier to construct, align, and operate.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="pmg1asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Pulsed Multiple Gas (PMG)
Laser Assembly</A> for a simplified (very rough) diagram of the overall
glasswork and power supply electronics (the complete cascade system).

<ul>
  <li>Overall - M.
  <li>Glass work - M.
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work) - M.

<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - Ranges from 464.9 nm to 627.1 nm depending on gas
 used, pressure, and mirrors.  (There are probably many more covering an even
 wider range but these are mostly from the paper.):

</pre>

Notes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>These are the dominant lines.  I am not sure why the dominant argon and
  krypton lines don't agree with those in normal ion lasers (514.5 nm and 488
  nm for argon; 647.1 nm and 413.1 nm for krypton).  It could just be an
  artifact of the mirrors they had at their disposal. :)
<p>
<li>It may also be possible to use pure neon in the PMG laser.  The lasing
  wavelengths would be 594.1 (yellow) and 611.9 (orange) which are the same
  as the corresponding HeNe lines.  I don't know which of the exciters
  would be (more) appropriate for use with neon.   See the section:
  <A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgcmg1">PMG Laser Construction References and
  Links</A> for additional info.
<p>
  According to Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com) there is also a line at
  around 545 nm (or should this be the green HeNe line at 543.5 nm?) which
  will lase brightly in a transverse discharge similar to that of the nitrogen
  laser and also lase in a long tube but not as strong.
</ol>
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium - Low pressure Ar, Kr, Xe, O2, or even air.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter - 5 mm OD, 3 mm ID; bore length - 70 cm.
<p>
  <li>Total tube length (includes additional space beyond the actual bore,
    e.g., to the center of the Brewster windows) - 92 cm.
<p>
  <li>Tube material - Borosilicate (Pyrex) glass.  The Brewster windows are
    made from optical flats (doesn't say what material) cemented to 11 mm OD
    Pyrex tubes extending from the electrode assemblies.
<p>
  <li>Electrodes - Cold cathode type consisting of the aluminum blocks joining
    the plasma tube and Brewster extensions.  Aluminum was chosen due to its
    low sputtering characteristics.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill - Pure Ar, Kr, Xe, or O2 at .01 to .2 Torr.  Which spectral
    lines are active are critically dependent on pressure, which must be
    maintained within +/- 10 percent to sustain output on a particular line.
    I assume that mixtures of gases could also be used.
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air or water jacket depending on pulse rate.  Note:
    the design shown in the paper has the water jacket running between
    electrodes.  Unless an expensive closed loop cooling system using deionized
    water is used, this would appear to be a problem with 15 kV pulses!  Tap
    water is usually a pretty good electrical conductor.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Brewster windows.  Select the Brewster angle based on average
    wavelength if fixed.  Mounting these on ball-and-socket joints as with
    the <A HREF="lasercar.htm#cartoc">Home-Built Pulsed Argon and/or Krypton
    (Ar/Kr) Ion Laser</A> might result in slightly better performance for any
    given line but the improvement would probably very slight.
<p>
  <li>Mirrors - Dielectric, concave, f = 100 cm; Reflectivity not specified.
    Large frame argon, krypton, or white light (ion) optics should be
    suitable depending on gas(es) selected.  Three screw
    <A HREF="mmount1.gif">Adjustable Mirror Mount</A> at each end can be used.
    Alignment can be performed via any of the techniques from this document
    or "Light and its Uses".  The paper suggests the 'card with pinhole and
    cross method'.
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length (mirror face to mirror face) - 100 cm.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Requirements - medium.  A 2 stage mechanical pump in good condition will
    be acceptable.  It must be able to reach less than .01 Torr.
<p>
  <li>Flowing gas operation required since in addition to being able to change
    gases if desired, pressure is a critical parameter for any given spectral
    line.  Pump exhausts at one end of tube with controlled gas leak feeding
    other end.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required - Pure Ar, Kr, Xe, and/or O2 though
  regular room air may be used at least for setup on the oxygen line.
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - electrical discharge.  Two options are described.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple exciter - 10 to 15 kV charges a .1 uF low ESR capacitor
    with a thyratron trigger.
<p>
  <li>Cascade system - a separate pulse forming network is used to
    shape the discharge current resulting in (according to the paper) nearly
    a square pulse of optical output.  (This would indicate that where a
    square output is achieved, lasing does NOT take place in the afterglow as
    has been suggested elsewhere.)

give any specs as to how long each of the four gases including krypton were

Well, for this one, there aren't any real guidelines except for those dealing
with safety - this is the true experimenters' home-built laser! :)

<li>Make sure you read, understand, and follow <b>ALL</b> the safety
 guidelines found in the section: <A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgsaf">Home-Built

<h3><A NAME="cmgspps">Sources of Special Parts and Supplies for the Home-Built
 PMG Laser</A></h3>

Aside from the glass work and vacuum system, you will need the gases.
<p>
For argon, krypton, and xenon, there isn't much choice - you have to buy a
small (lecture bottle?).  There simply aren't any pure sources of these gases
available in common household appliances.
<p>
Oxygen can easily be obtained in the same way or you can generate it using
a variety of chemical methods.  One simple one I remember fondly was to mix
hydrogen peroxide (from your drugstore) with manganese dioxide (from dead
carbon-zinc batteries or a chemical supply house).
<p>
Ordinary air can be obtained, well, you know where to get that!  However, keep
away from your local politicians due to the contamination and excessive
temperature (which affects lasing). :)

<h3><A NAME="cmgcomt">Using Commercial Laser Tubes to Construct the PMG
 Laser</A></h3>

It may be possible to use a commercial helium-neon (HeNe) and/or
argon/krypton (Ar/Kr) ion laser tube as the starting point for the
Home-Built PMG laser.  Where the lasing wavelength is close to one or more of
those for the HeNe or Ar/Kr laser tube, this may be as 'simple' as opening its
exhaust tube and attaching it to your vacuum/gas delivery system and power
supply.  Several of the Ar, Kr, and Ne wavelengths do coincide with those of
commercial laser tubes (though for HeNe tubes, these are mostly the less
common and expensive non-red variety).  And, many of the Xe lines appear to be
close enough to the wavelengths of available tubes.  The one at 627.1 nm
should even work with a red HeNe tube.  Where the wavelengths are not
compatible, replacement mirrors or Brewster windows and external mirrors would
be needed.  However, with that amount of additional effort, the advantages of
this approach may mostly disappear.
<p>
<A HREF="pmg2asm.gif">Home-Built PMG Laser Using HeNe Laser Tube</A> shows
one possible configuration driven by the 'Simple Exciter' described below.
This would make a particularly nice setup especially if the tube's mirrors are
already known to be properly aligned.
<p>
Depending on the gas fill, a diffusion pump or ion pump (in addition to the
mechanical pump shown) may be desirable but probably not essential,
especially if the flow-through gas system is used.  However, where the vacuum
connection is only made at one end of the tube, a better vacuum system would
make life easier by reducing the number of pump-down, back-fill cycles needed
to achieve necessary gas fill purity.

<h3><A NAME="cmgdolu">Daniel's Oxygen Laser</A></h3>

Daniel Ames is constructing a version of the PMG laser using the carcass of
an argon ion laser tube as his starting point.
<p>
(From: Daniel Ames (dlames3@msn.com).)
<p>
Well, as you know, making a laser from scratch or even modified parts is a 
big undertaking, especially for one that uses more than 15 kVDC and has very
little  existing info and specs.  A Challenge. :)
<p>
Here is the present status:

<ol>
<li>The head is 95% complete - except for;
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Still need to cut the hole in the top for the fan.  
 <li>Haven't decided on the electrical (HVDC) feed-throughs, (side or rear of
   head)
 <li>Still need to add the air cooled heatsinks to the tube.
 <li>Need to align the optics. 
 </ul>
<p>
<li>I am currently making an (aluminum) optical table that the head is bolted 
 to.  It contains a 17" 632.8 nm HeNe laser head which is linearly polarized.
 I have two adjustable mirror to direct the HeNe's beam.  This will greatly
 help in getting the bore of the tube centered with the optical center of 
 the its mirrors, plus aiding in being able to check and re-align (if
 necessary) the mirrors in order to switch OCs and HRs for testing purposes.
 I must say, it is turning out very very nice. :)  And when I am done with it
 for the oxygen laser, it will be very useful for re-aligning other lasers.
<p>
<li>The power supply:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Still awaiting the HV capacitor.  This should arrive very soon. (.05 uF
 at 30 kVDC) with very low and inductance.
<p>
 <li>The triggered and vented spark gap still needs a controllable triggering 
  source. I will probably use a standard ignition coil from a car. I have
  already built and tested this circuit and it does seem to work nicely. Then
  the output will be rectified to charge a small HV cap that will in-turn
  trigger the main spark gap through a smaller spark gap. I must admit, 
  this part of the PSU I am not as clear on as I would like to be...
<p>
 <li>Main discharge: I plan to run this tube @ voltages between 12.7 kV and
  21.2 kV at .05 uF  with rectified neon sign transformers.
</ul>
</ol>

Stay tuned for further exciting updates. :) Sorry, no pictures yet... (Top
Secret and all that...).
<p>
(About a month passes.....)
<p>
Well, I finally got some pics taken of my present oxygen laser (or PMG laser,
take your pick).  It's not finished as yet.  As with most home-brew laser
projects, it seem as though the closer I get to completion the, more
considerations or obstacles I encounter.  :)

<p>
(Several months later, semi-success but partial false alarm.....)
<p>
Well, I finally finished up the small version of my O2 PMG Laser.
I had been trying to get it to lase for three (3) days now and just when I
was ready to shelve it again and start building a much bigger tube...  Drum
roll please! I am very pleased to announce that - on April 10th at 3:00 pm
PSDT, the Oxygen Laser is LASING = YES!!!!!!!
<p>
It actually LASED. :) A beautiful violet/blue, probably the 441.4 nm or 441.6
nm lines - love those wavelengths, or maybe it's the 464.9 nm line, but it 
appears to be more the color of a 442 nm HeCd laser.
<p>
I still have some modifications to work out with the power supply, but hey, it
lases! YES, i'm ecstatic!!! After a little more than 1 year of research,
design, and manufacturing, I can hardly believe it.  I will be adding photos
and more details later. Right now, the output power is quite low and
unmeasured, but it is very likely that by modifying the 
power supply and the OC optic that the output power will greatly be 
increased. Crowd goes WILD!!!
<p>
(Two days later.)
<p>
As you know I reported that my small O2 laser was in fact lasing in the 
Violet/Blue reign. Upon further testing and evaluation, I am now somewhat 
doubtful that it was the oxygen that was lasing. :(
<p>
At first, the only way this 7.5" cavity would lase was to close off the O2 
supply and open both valves from the tube to the vacuum pump. At this time,
the tube had an air leak of about 20 Torr in 5 minutes. Upon fixing the 
leak, I could not get any sign of lasing at all with just O2. Then I found 
that by drawing in plain old air into the tube, it would lase again, still 
only in a pulsed mode. 
<p>
Here are the present operating parameters:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Optics are coated for 442 nm. OC is flat, HR has a Radius of Curvature
 (RoC) = 44 inches.  The spacing between the mirrors is 20 inches with a
 cavity active length of 7.5 inches.
<p>
<li>Pressure range is 0.5 to 1.5 Torr. Above that the lasing would die out.
<p>
<li>Power supply voltage is 5 to 10 kVDC pulsed.  The energy storage capacitor
 is .03 uF.  A Blumlein configuration was also tried using two .03 uF caps
 with an open air spark gap, and separately a pressurized N2 triggered spark
 gap.  Results were very comparable.  With air or N2, the output increased
 with the higher voltages of 10 kV.
</ul>
<p>
I found that with one of the optics removed, all lasing stopped.  I tried
substituting a multiline argon HR mirror for the original 442 nm OC - again no
lasing.  In general, the optical alignment had to be correct or all lasing
would stop.  I also tried substituting an uncoated blank optic having a 44
inch RoC for the original HR and had similar lasing to the original 442 nm
pair.
<p>
I also tried N2 and air with very negligible difference using all optic and
spark gap combinations above. The gas pressures were similar within the lasing
high and low limits.
<p>
My conclusions at this point: I suspect that it was the N2 in air that was
actually lasing, NOT oxygen as I found that I was fooled by the target, (plain
old white printer paper). This paper was actually fluorescing the violet/blue
color that I originally thought were the oxygen lines 441.4 and 441.6 nm. Upon
further investigation, I substituted a non fluorescing target and found no
visible output.  Oxygen does have at least 4 UV lasing lines, but since this
laser's output was very similar using air or N2, I have for now, ruled out
that it was lasing the O2 UV lines, but instead, it was producing a coherent
UV beam from the pulsed N2.
<p>
I know from testing this laser with varying parameters, that the UV lasing
requires a very fast pulse,  Sorry but I am not set-up yet to measure the
pulse width. However, the electrical connectors to the tube are made from 1/2"
wide brass for a shorter pulse delivery. All the other connectors to the caps
and spark gap are also 1/2" wide and as short as possible. This setup works
well, but when I add an inductor into the anode circuit (20 feet of 18 gauge
copper wire), the lasing ceased.  Since it does lase (pulsed only) with either
N2 or just plain old vanilla-flavored air, the obvious assumption would be
that it is the N2 lasing as in an N2 Blumlein type laser, unless I am getting
different UV lines for air than with just N2. If so, than maybe the N2 in air
is transferring some energy to the O2 atoms? or helping the O2 atoms to return
to their ground state?  I have never heard of an N2 Ion laser. :)
<p>
For now, my only plans for this very short laser will be to try to increase
the voltage and try again with O2.
<p>
(From Sam.)
<p>
One thing is that I wouldn't expect the mirrors to matter that much with N2 as
I understand it so maybe you have discovered something new. :)  Of course,
if it is indeed UV, those mirrors really shouldn't do much anyhow - about the
same as plain glass which I think is what you found out.  But the fact that
alignment is critical is at the very least, interesting....
<p>
Don't rip it apart - there is something strange going on and it deserves a
proper investigation.
<p>
(From: Jon Singer (jon@joss.com).)
<p>
There is an N2 ion laser which runs at 428 nm, and could be what Daniel was
seeing. In fact, Diane Neisius mentions this laser further down on the same
page, though she refers to it as He-N2+.
<p>
I also think Mark Csele also mentions it on one of his pages -- if his students
don't put quite enough N2 into the excimer laser, they sometimes see the
visible line.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
Wow, what a problem! N2 is usually superradiant, if your on the traditional
N2 line, the only thing I can think of is the mirrors are just kicking it
past the lasing threshold.   Is the pure N2 power (measured on a scope, not
eyeball) greater then the air power? Air impedes the pulsed N2 line.  Also
N2 doesn't like low pressure. 
<p>
Most of the pulsed gas lasers reside in the low pressure area which
explains why you would get lasing when the valves are locked off and the
pump fluid is outgassing.  Pump fluid causes the pump to hang at 100 microns
or so for a while, till the air and water vapors are expelled from the pump
oil by mechanical heating. That 100 microns to 250 microns is a good area
for pulsed lasing.
<p>
Tough question. I don't know what you have. You need to find a old UV-VIS
spectrophotometer from a hospital or similar place and rip the calibrated
monochromator out of it.    I think we can rule out the pulsed argon UV
lines, it's only a very small partial pressure of air.  Unless it's the N2
molecular line, you have a ion line going there or God knows what else. 
<p>
I need to think about this for a while......
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
(Several weeks later.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>I still have yet to see any visible lasing.
<p>
<li>I still am not convinced that the UV lasing is from the N2 in plain
 vanilla flavored air since I can <i>increase</i> the UV output of air by
 bleeding in a small amount of O2 at a ratio of 4:1+ (N2:O2).  Go figure.
<p>
 If it is lasing the N2 in the air, then according to Steve Roberts, it 
 is lasing in the afterglow and not superradiantly. But O2 is said to hinder
 N2 from lasing.  Go figure again. :)
<p>
 I do not get any UV lasing using the same pressure with just O2, so if it is 
 lasing the O2 in air, then I would propose that the N2 is required for 
 similar reasons that HeNe lasers need He and/or CO2 lasers need N2 + He.
 In the case of O2, possibly it provides a molecular vibrational energy
 transfer from the N2 to the O2, or the N2 helps the O2 return to it's ground
 state before the next pulse.
<p>
<li>With some modifications of the capacitor arrangement and the length of the 
 inductor, plus different optics, I am now getting a very tight and very 
 bright beam with very low divergence - approximately that of a long TEM00
 HeNe laser. The beam spot on a target at 6 feet measures about a 3/32" to
 1/8" in diameter.  Note: Using plain ole white printer paper as a UV target,
 I can still see the beam spot under an 80 W fluorescent light from a distance
 of 8 to 10 feet. 
</ol>
<p>

The strange thing is that it does not lase on every pulse especially at 
higher rep rates. At 1 to 2 pps, it lases on most pulses, but at, say, 10 pps,
or higher (up to 60 pps tested) it's a hit and miss situation.
<p>
The funny thing is, I was not and am not attempting to achieve a UV output,
although O2 does have (4) UV lasing lines at 298.43 nm, 374.949 nm, 375.470 nm,
and 375.985 nm .  (Reference: Journal of Applied Optics, vol. 4, no. 5, May
1965, pg. 576.)
<p>
PS. My next O2 (P.M.G) laser will have a 115 cm length with an ID of 7mm.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Hmmmm.  The only way to really narrow this down would be to determine at
which wavelength(s) it is actually lasing.  The three near-UV wavelengths
listed above would certainly pass through a glass or plastic prism or
diffraction grating; the one around 298 nm might.  They would all work with
a reflection grating.  So, there may be hope of determining at least which
grouping the wavelength is in or if it is actually somewhere else.
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
Right you are.  I fired it up today  with an Edmund Scientific transmission
grating.  At a distance of 68-1/8" from the grating for the 0th order spot,
the 1st order spot is 6" (+/- 1/16") away.  The spot from a HeNe laser using
the same setup is 11-3/8 (+/- 1/16").
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Using the approximation that sin(x)=x for small x, the ratio of distances
is equal to the ratio of wavelengths.  This results in a wavelength of about
342 nm.  Hmmmm, pretty close to the 337.1 nm N2 line. :( (Without using the
approximation, the result is about 345 nm.)  If your measurements are off by
1/16", it could be exactly the N2 line.
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
Not bad at all. I figured it was probably the N2 line in air, but I did find
some interesting ways of stimulating it, such as lasing it in the afterglow
and adding O2 at a certain N2 pressure to amplify the output.  So, I guess
this laser does fit the description of a PMG laser after all.  If only I could
find that darn air leak, I have isolated it to the laser or it's vacuum line
connections, I guess I will just have to develop the poor man's helium leak
detector.
<p>
I made a more precise measurement and now come up with a wavelength of
334.3 nm.  I also drew a cool diagram:
<A HREF=
"http://members.aol.com/dlames2/wavelength/diffraction_diag.gif">Determining
Relative Wavelengths using Diffraction Grating</A> (currently not available).
<p>
Did you know that N II lases at around 350 nm? I found a reference to it back
in 1964.
<p>
Interestingly, with this lumped capacitor longitudinal Blumlein type 
discharge, the length of the inductor (as used with traverse Blumlein N2
laser circuits), is unusual.  I am using two caps with a common negative and
the spark gap is across one of the caps.  The 2nd cap is discharged through
the cavity just like the Blumlein N2 lasers, except the discharge is
longitudinal and the caps are not the flat plate type, but rather industry
standard pulse caps.
<p>
I found that by using the larger (.05 uF, C2) cap for the spark gap and the
smaller (.03 uF, C1) cap discharging through the cavity, that the output was
significantly increased.  The inductor lengths tried across the two + sides
of the caps at 18 to 22 kVDC with a pulse rate of 1 to 2 pulses per second
with pressures ranging between .5 to 5 Torr:

<ul>
<li>16" = no ionization on most pulses = moderate (UV) output.
<li>50" = 30 - 50% of  the pulses ionization = moderate (UV) output.
<li>16' = 95% of pulses ionized = strongest (UV) output.
<li>50' = no output.
</ul>

These lengths are the total amount of wire wrapped arond a 1" diameter
plastic tube in each case.
<p>
The pulsed fluorescent blue/violet beam spot of this laser - as viewed on 
plain white printer paper at a distance of 3' and using just plain ole (air) 
as the lasing medium is now so bright that if it were continuous, you would 
not want to look at it without laser safety goggles at 400 to 450 nm and UV 
blocking.  Within a certain pressure range after the air starts lasing,
adding a small amount of O2 increases output even further.
<p>
I was looking through my assorted optics tonight and found some dielectric 
(UV) flat bar type mirrors.  I tested them with this ?UV beam for reflection
and transmission.  Reflection was great, transmission was zilch meaning 0 
detected... hmmmmmm...  I might try one of these for the HR since now I 
have two very bright UV beams exiting the laser, one at each optic. 
I would love to try lasing a dye in a quartz cell, without a resonator.  It
just might work as the comparable output of my home made PMG laser on the same
white fluorescent target appears much brighter than a commercial TEA N2 laser
I had which would lase superradiantly a dye without a resonator.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Assuming the inductor is in the same place as for the N2 laser, I bet it
isn't behaving like a simple inductor when you get to the really long
configuration - it has capacitance as well and is shorting your cavity.
<p>
What happens if you replace the inductor with a string of resistors?
For the Blumlein, the inductor should really behave as an open circuit
when the spark gap fires.  A resistor of a few K ohms should do the same.
<p>
I'm also not really sure why you need C2 (the capacitor across the spark
gap) at all for this configuration.
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
I haven't tried a resistor as a substitute for the inductor yet, but I do know 
from my experimentations that a 50' 18awg inductor that is wound (layer upon 
layer) on a small spool similar to the ones used in pulse forming networks 
for flashlamps and for pulsed argons but no output.  50' of 18 AWG wire is
approximately. .31925 ohms, inductance was not measured.  It would seem as
though that with these larger cap values (larger uFs than most TE N2 lasers)
that possibly the inductor plays a roll in shutting down the pulse through
the cavity?  Since O2 is said to lase in the afterglow, a sharp drop off of
the ionization pulse, on the trailing edge is needed, that is why the
Canadians used a (donated) thyratron.
<p>
As for why I used C2: It's because at these low pressures, below about 1 Torr,
the gas in the cavity would continuously (barely) ionize even when the spark
gap was in the (hold/off) cycle. It could be that a different spark gap and
triggering source might solve the problem.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I still suspect that your larger inductors are acting more like capacitors. :(
<p>
You really need to measure the pulse duration of your discharge.  The usual
way to do this is to put a low value resistor (.1 ohms, .01 ohms, etc.) in the
discharge return path and measure voltage across it.  But you can't do that
with your setup because there is not ground point in the discharge path.
<p>
I'd suggest constructing pulse transformer - put one of the conductors going
to the tube through a ferrite core.  Wrap a few turns of insulated wire around
the core and terminate those with a low value resistor (a few ohms).  Put your
scope across the resistor.
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
I now have different optics in this laser (same one as my
Pulsed Multiple Gas Laser Project).  The UV output is now stronger than
ever using just <b>AIR</b>!!!!!!  No exaggerating - the output of my air
laser is tremendously brighter when viewed on plain white printer paper than
my commercially built TEA N2 laser (using the same paper) with it's
very expensive pressurized and triggered spark gap using pure N2.  Note: The
TEA N2 laser has lased some dyes to superradiance without a resonator.
<p>
My air laser's output at a distance of 5" from the cavity no longer has 
the bright (blue) fluorescent color on white paper.  Now it is so bright 
that the bright blue is starting to take on a white/blue fluorescent color. 
The TEA N2 laser using pure N2 never did that.  The real puzzling part is
this is that the air laser actually seems to like the air combination of
80% N2 and 20% O2 with an additional 1 to 3 Torr of O2 with an approximate
ratio of air + O2 up to about 1:0.5.
<p>
I now have a fabulous animated version of my PMG laser.  Check out
<A HREF=
 "http://members.aol.com/soccrattes/N2_Project/LGB_2_P_Min.gif">Daniel Ames'
PMG Laser Operation</A> (currently not available).  Since this was designed
and drawn for pulsed gas lasers that lase in the afterglow (i.e., the trailing
edge of the ionization pulse) the stimulated emission is shown <i>after</i>
the first glow of ionization.
<p>
<b>FLASH!</b>
<p>
I have succeeded in lasing oxygen with a little bit of green 559.1 nm from 
this little converted argon tube. Verified that it is actually visible output
and not just week UV fluorescence on white paper appearing to be green. That
was  easy, just insert a piece of (most any clear plastic/acrylic) into the
beam's path. If the lasing vanishes, it is a visible wavelength, easy, huh?
<p>
Back to the 559.1 nm lasing, the output so far is very very weak, probably no 
more than  .05 mW and it is very very critical to maintain the exact mirror
alignment.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Congratulations!  Even .05 mW of visible is fabulous!  But, yes, absolute
cleanliness is likely to be critical for the lower gain visible wavelengths.
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
It is possible that different optics, or spacing out these optics much
further, or changing the ionization pulse width, or changing the phase of the
moon :), etc. might also make a positive difference in the output. Their RoC
is 2 m.  So they are way to long for this short (19") resonator for normal
alignment. I am using two HR mirrors, so both have the 2 m RoC. The output
beam waist diameter is very small, perhaps 0.2 to 0.3 mm.  The bore diameter
is approximately. 1.2 mm.  I did try the HR and OC together, but no lasing
found yet with this combination.
<p>
I suspect that it would lase more strongly if it was not for some 
brass deposits inside the cathode's Brewster stem and possibly on the inside 
of the Brewster window as well (although the latter is not noticeable).  So,
Material Recommendation coming:  Don't use brass for hole plugs, electrodes,
or anything else that the discharge and it's afterglow overglow can come in 
contact with. The original brass (non-OEM) gas inlet fitting on the anode did
not cause this problem, but I used brass 1/8"NPT hole plugs with TorrSeal by
Varian to plug the two holes in the cathode bell (for the original filament
and getter from the ion tube).  The cathode does of course get hotter than the
anode.  Whether it is the additional heat, (I doubt it) or the fact that at
very low pressures below 1 Torr, the discharge/ionization overshoots the
cathode and travels down the Brewster stem towards the window...  There's a
hint in here somewhere. :)
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yep, it's called sputtering and is more of a problem with materials like brass
especially when running at low pressure which increase the mean-free-path so
that positive ions strike the cathode with higher velocities knocking off
metal atoms which go anywhere they want. :)
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
Well, enough testing with oxygen with this little tube, so my plans for it 
are to revert it back to an N2 compatible (O2/N2/Air UV laser) which 
totally amazed me concerning the strength of the UV output. I am currently
making  up a small dye resonator to test with this Air laser's output.
<p>
(A few weeks pass.)
<p>
I have now succeeded in getting Coumarin XX to lase superradiantly (a little)
but the real problem is that the pump beam waist diameter and divergence from
the modified argon ion tube PMG laser is so narrow (1.5  to 2 mm diameter),
that even with a quartz cylindrical lens, most of the pumping energy to the
dye cell is still centered in the middle of the line.  I used a borrowed dye
cell, but hopefully I will be able to keep it long enough to add a resonator,
at least an HR mirror to it plus a vertical (primary) cylindrical quartz lens
at 90 degrees to the second one to widen the beam before it enters the
secondary horizontal cylindrical quartz lens and dye cell. Hopefully the
losses of adding a second lens will not be counter-productive. 
<p>
And, now for my future plans:
<p>
Today I started (finally) acquiring the parts to built a much longer PMG 
laser. The head housing is that of a Liconix model 3220 HeCd, (the big one) and
measures 37" long which features a nonmetallic 4 rod resonator frame that 
is just begging to be used for a high voltage laser application. After 
considering countless laser tube an electrode designs for getting the longest 
possible active cavity length plus the feasibility of actually producing what 
was on paper or (the monitor), I finally decided to go with plan "L"...... 
Plan "A" will be the grand daddy of them all with a 56" in active cavity 
length and water-cooled cavity and electrodes, but that's for a later date. 
This current design, (plan L) will feature an active cavity length of 31" plus
a large gas reservoir for temporarily sealed operation plus the means for a 
flowing gas mode, which also helps during the evacuation and outgassing
process.  Here is a summary of the features of my universal laser design:

<ol>
<li>I'm utilizing a tried and true very stable resonator framework and head
 housing from a Liconix model 3220 HeCd laser head.
<p>
<li>My plasma tube can easily be interchanged with different diameter tubes.
<p>
<li>The electrodes and windows or optics are easily replaceable.
<p>
The resonator optics can be easily converted to or from a Fabry-Perot
 to a DFB (Distributed FeedBack) design using a diffraction grating HR.
<p>
<li>HVDC transmission lines are interchangeable with flat or coaxial cables.

My vacuum system will also be enhanced, with a (4) stage diffusion pump and
valves + an alcohol/dry ice absorption pump/trap, plus 1 or 2 vacuum
traps, an N2 hot gas heater, an Ion gauge and two thermocouple gauges.  Of
course, this will all happen overnight, right!!!.
<p>
Stay tuned.

This sounds like a plan.  Of course, you realize that your dram vacuum
system is probably way overkill for testing of gas lasers.  Perhaps, you are
going to go into the tube refurb business??? :)

It is oxygen lasing, just not on the transitions mentioned in the Review of
Scientific Instruments article.  See:
<b>U.S. Patent #3,928,820: High Gain Pulsed Ion Laser</b>.
<p>
Here is the abstract of the patent:
<p>
<blockquote>
"A high gain pulsed ion laser is described in which a short discharge pulse of
 less than about 2.0 microseconds is applied to a discharge tube in which
 oxygen is present in an amount sufficient to establish an oxygen pressure in
 the range between about 10 and 100 millitorr. The pulsed output from the ion
 laser occurs during the "afterglow" of the discharge pulse and is attributed
 to doubly ionized oxygen. The wavelength of the output may be selected from
 certain lines in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic
 spectrum."

Having obtained the patent, here are (some) of the highlights:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Tube sizes successfully used, length and bore diameters, gas pressures,
 O2/mixtures and partial pressures.
<li>Electrode designs successfully used.
<li>Relationship of the electrical pulse to the afterglow lasing pulse.
<li>Charge voltage versus output power graphs (Input kVDC versus output power).
<li>Output mirror reflectivities.
<li>Additional UV lasing lines and relationships of the UV lines to input
 energy versus output energy.
<li>Oxygen's relaxation time versus electrical pulse duration and rise times,
<li>When the "afterglow" stimulated emissions start in relationship to the 
 electrical pulse.
<li>What gain value is need to get a short laser cavity of only 16 cm (6.27") 
 with a 2.4 mm diameter bore to lase with only 50% reflective optics, that's
 right - 50% R.
<li>PLUS more journal references.

This is a good one for reference!

The big oxygen laser is still shaping up nicely, but not completed
yet. Ran into some design considerations concerning whether to place the
gas and vacuum valve in the laser head (preferred) or external (not
attached to the head) and whether to use standard glass stopcocks or
Ace Glass brand P.T.F.E. vacuum valves that have 3 O-rings for seals. I
am leaning towards the Ace Glass valves mainly because of the (oxygen
lasing gas) and the glass stopcocks expose the cavity/brewster windows and
oxygen gas to the necessary vacuum grease. The main reason for desiring
the valves to be inside the laser head is so that when it is disconnected
from the vacuum system, it is all self contained. The main drawback to
mounting the valves on the resonator's base frame is that opening and
closing the valves will add strain or twist to it and possibly effect the
optical alignment.

<h3><A NAME="cmgdian">Diane's Transverse Excited PMG Laser</A></h3>

This home-built laser is rather unique in that while designed roughly along
the lines of the SciAm nitrogen laser, it is much more sophisticated and has
also been tested using other gases including neon.  And lasing at some
unusual visible wavelengths has been achieved.  Thus, I include it here
rather than in the chapter on the home-built N2 laser.  A general description
and photos can be found on
<A HREF="http://www.diane-neisius.de/laser/index_E.html">Diane's
Laser Page</A> under the "Querfl&ouml;te" laser.
A detailed diagram can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.diane-neisius.de/laser/n2diag_E.gif">Querfl&ouml;te
Laser</A>.
<p>
Here is a summary:
<p>
The "Querfl&ouml;te" laser I built basically is of the same design as most 
other N2 lasers except two major details:<br><br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The discharge tube is segmented and one of the attached transmission lines 
 is slotted.
<p>
<li>Both transmission lines are folded together thus saving 50% room.<br><br>
</ol>
<p>
The second feature is more easily to explain. To get an idea, imagine an 
ordinary N2 laser like a butterfly - both transmission lines are the wings and 
the butterfly's body is the laser tube. Now the butterfly folds its wings 
together (sitting on a flower or so): both wings touch each other, and the 
body is at the edge of both wings.
<p>
Back to the transmission lines, they are folded over in a way the common line 
touches itself. So both transmission lines are the outer sides of a capacitor 
stack, with the dielectric and the common line (as a single plate) in between 
them.
<p>
I adopted the segmented bore design from the following
paper which describes a hydrogen laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Kirkland, Dogett, Kim, "Vacuum-UV H2-laser excited by a traveling-wave
 discharge", Rev. Sci. Inst. 52(1981) p.1338.
</ul>
<p>
Hydrogen lasers have very narrow discharge bores 
even if they are transverse excited. The trick the authors used was to build 
no true transverse discharge tube but a long series of short longitudinal 
discharges with alternating pin electrodes in a long thin bore. I liked that 
idea, for a small volume means high energy density - and by that a better 
chance to get lasing out of other stuff as nitrogen or air. (Note: I built a 
number of different ordinary N2 lasers before starting that Querfl&ouml;te
project  in 1991. The tip seen occasionally: "Just put neon in your N2
laser and you'll get green lasing" JUST DIDN'T WORK!
<p>
The spark-gap sided electrodes of the bore are connected to a common aluminum 
plate which serves as transmission line and base plate in one. The other 
transmission line is slotted, so every of the electrodes connected to it has 
its own transmission line strip. In a way, it's a long series of short
Bl&uuml;mleins which have the spark-gap-sided transmission line in common. 
This design allows a variable length of the laser - just short some strips to 
ground to change.
<p>
A surprising fact was that no charging resistors are needed, as I found out by 
experiment (The Kirkland et. al. paper have them in their design, as I had
initially). I have no idea why it works this way - perhaps there is some
residual ionization from the preceding pulse acting as resistor during the
next charging phase of a single strip?
<p>
The bore itself I modified somewhat - I felt not happy about a pure plastic 
surface exposed to the violent thunderstorm of a gas discharge. So I decided 
to make the Plexiglas bore wider, inserting short pieces of Pyrex tubes 
between the pin electrodes to protect the plastic walls. As few hours of 
operation showed up, it works: near the electrodes, where the Plexiglas outer 
tube is uncovered by the Pyrex, white and brown decomposition products became 
visible.
<p>
The spark gap itself is in one corner of the transmission line - however, I 
observed never asymmetric laser output when running without a rear mirror.
Design of the gap is the common type with a screw acting as one electrode - 
pulse repetition rate is adjusted by turning the screw (to do this without 
getting zapped, I attached a plastic rod to it by the help of a short piece of 
vacuum hose).
<p>
<b>Discharge tube</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Discharge bore: 3 mm wide and 98 cm long.
<li>Electrode separation: 14 mm.
<li>Transmission lines: 10 cm long.
<li>Total capacity using 0.3 mm of soft vinyl as dielectric: 10 nF
 (spark gap sided base plate) and 6 nF (all strip lines added).
</ul>
<p>
<b>Power supply</b>
<p>
This is an ordinary surplus 4 kVAC neon sign transformer delivering 35 mA. 
Nice thing, got it at the back door of a neon sign shop nearly for free. :) It 
feeds into a voltage doubler/rectifier producing 10 kVDC.
<p>
<b>The vacuum and gas supply unit</b>
<p>
This is a single stage rotary vacuum pump with exhaust filter (aquarium filter
charcoal) connected to one side, low pressure gas can (12 bar) with needle
valve and mercury vacuum gauge (0 to 80 Torr) connected to the other side of
the tube. The needle valve is used to adjust pressure, the laser is operated
in flow through mode.
<p>
<b>Optics</b>
<p>
The tube lases without any mirrors. However, an aluminum mirror very close to 
the rear tube window increases the brightness of the output beam visibly.
<p>
Separation of the mirror to the discharge bore is a simple method of
measuring pulse length:  Recall that directly after the pulse, nearly
all of the molecules/atoms are in the lower energy level of the laser
transition. Thus the just stopped discharge is the perfect absorber
for the laser light left in the bore.  So, the reflected laser pulse
from the mirror *must* have traveled down the entire bore *before*
the discharge stops to have a visible effect in output.  The trick is
to measure the distance d from the tube where your mirror just no longer 
has any visible effect:
light:
<p>
<pre>
  t = ( L + 2 * d )/ c
</pre>
<p>
L is the length of the tube and c is the speed of light.
Then t is an estimate of the pulse length.
<p>
<b>Gases used in the Querfl&ouml;te laser</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Nitrogen and air at 35 Torr produce nice 337 nm UV lasing. My silicon PIN 
 photodiode tells me something about average 10 to 12 mW (16 mW on a good
 day!) for nitrogen.
<p>
<li>Neon at 58 Torr puts out amazing green 540 nm laser from a salmon red 
 discharge. Mrs. Diode tells me average 1 to 2 mW.  At 7 Torr, neon produces
 the weaker 614 nm orange line, but this is hard to obtain. Usually it worked
 only after long periods of green neon, when the bore was sufficient cleaned
 by the discharge heat. Today (in 2003) the bore is 11 years old and
 substantially degraded by nearly 50 hours on it. So the orange neon
 no longer appears.  The yellow neon line at 594 nm I didn't catch even
 in better days.
<p>
<li>Helium-nitrogen shows the ordinary UV line from N2. On one occasion I got 
 something blue that went straight through an UV block filter from a few Torrs 
 of N2 with a lot of (near 1 atm) He. Possibly the He-N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>
 laser at 428 nm? According to some authors, it is operated at 
 atmospheric pressures in 100:1 mixtures. Due to lack of a pressure gauge for
 that range, I couldn't reproduce it until now - left for future research. :)
</ul>

</pre>
A thyratron is the vacuum tube equivalent of an SCR - you can turn it on (with
a positive pulse to its grid) but plate current must cease for it to switch
off.
<p>
The 10 to 15 kV high voltage supply charges C1.  When a positive pulse is
applied to the grid of the thyratron, it turns into a short circuit (sort of)
discharging C1 into the laser tube.  (Note: I am suspect of the grid network
part values.  As shown, the input pulse will be attenuated to 1/3 of its
peak value (down to 100 V).  I do not know if this would succeed in triggering
the thyratron.)
<p>
The source of the HV is not specified.  My choice would be a high frequency
inverter or the HV guts of a deceased TV or monitor.  A suitable design can be
found in the document:
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/samschem.htm">Various Schematics
and Diagrams</A>.  The voltage for the thyratron filament can be easily
provided by a modified microwave oven transformer.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserclp.htm#clprew">Rewinding a Microwave Oven Transformer for use
as a Low Voltage Filament Supply</A>.  CAUTION: Filament winding must use
insulation good for more than 15 kV!  The thyratron and laser tube position
could be swapped to eliminate the need for the HV insulated filament leads,
but then both ends of the laser tube will be at a high potential.
<p>
There is one serious problem with the simple exciter: With no control of
the shape of the pulse into the laser tube, the current will be more or
less a decaying exponential.  This means that if the laser's output pulse
intensity depends on tube current, it will also not be anywhere close to
constant.  The cascade system remedies this deficiency.  (This appear
to apply only to Ar, Kr, Xe - O2 could need the short pulse and high peak
current of the simple exciter and thus may not benefit - or work at all - with
the cascade system.)

<h3><A NAME="cmgcas">Cascade System</A></h3>

A scheme very similar to the simple exciter described above is only used
to provide the initial ionization for the tube (e.g., to start it for each
laser pulse).  A separate Pulse Forming Network (PFN) charged from a 1 to 3 kV
supply then discharges through the laser tube.  This is similar to the
approach used for many solid state lasers to trigger their flashlamps.
<p>
The cascade system consists of two parts.  The trigger supply is nearly
identical to the simple exciter except for replacing the .1 uF capacitor
(C1) with a .001 uF capacitor since very little energy is needed for the
starting pulse.
<p>
The PFN itself consists of four 2 uF, 5 kV capacitors and three homemade
inductors.  It is isolated from the trigger supply by a 5 kV diode capable of
high peak currents.  (The paper specifies a mercury vapor rectifier which was
state-of-the-art in 1971).  A microwave oven rectifier may be suitable today.

</PRE>
It may be possible to connect the pulse forming network directly to the laser
tube anode (Tube+) rather than to the plate of the thyratron as shown here and
in the paper.  I believe this should work just as well without requiring the
high current pulse to flow through the thyratron (or an alternate trigger
device - see below).  WARNING: This DOES mean that the laser tube anode will
have a lethal voltage on it as long as the PFN supply capacitors are charged
rather than being blocked by the trigger device!
<p>
The only information on the inductors is that they are 400, 500, and 600
turns of #18 AWG wire on a Plexiglas form (for L1, L2, and L3 respectively).
There is no mention of the diameter, or the winding arrangement or packing. :(

For the 1 to 3 kV charging power supply, a simple Variac and small neon sign
transformer (or for higher power, a microwave oven transformer - DANGER!).

</ul>
There you have it. :)

<h3><A NAME="cmgalt">Alternatives to the Thyratron</A></h3>

Although the thyratron is similar to an SCR, solid state technology hasn't
yet produces a single SCR that can hold off 15 kV!
<p>
Multiple SCRS (like 15 or 20!) could theoretically be used but the SCR is also
slower than a thyratron and might not be suitable for this reason alone.
There are several potential alternatives to a thyratron (and I believe that
this level of performance is not needed in any case - see below):
<ul>
<li>Triggered spark gap - This is basically similar to a xenon flashlamp in
 operation: A trigger pulse on a third electrode in proximity to the device
 initiates conduction between a pair of main electrodes.  Air can be used and
 in fact, it may be possible to build a triggered spark gap for 15 kV with a
 pair of electrodes about 1 inch apart inside a glass tube which has the
 trigger wire wrapped around it.  The trigger pulse can be generated by a
 conventional strobe type trigger circuit.
<p>
<li>Large (long) xenon tube - This behaves in a similar manner) but finding
 one for 15 kV may be difficult and expensive.  Several in series could be
 used but this gets to be excessively complex.
<p>
<li>Mechanical pulser - A rotating motor drive distributor similar to what is
 used for the <A HREF="laserccb.htm#ccbtoc">Home-Built Copper Chloride (CuCl)
 and Copper Bromide (CuBr) Laser</A>.
</ul>
The triggered spark gap using air would be my first choice for use as the
trigger device for the cascade system.
<p>
The important thing is to give all those electrons in the PFN a place to go -
it doesn't matter how you do it!

<h3><A NAME="cmgops">Other Power Supply Options</A></h3>

Yet another alternative would be use the trigger supply to ionize the gas in
the laser tube directly by wrapping its output lead around the tube.  The only
problem with this approach is that it would pretty much preclude the use of
water cooling since there would be no way to get the triggering wire close
enough to the bore - you can't put it inside a water filled tube!
<p>
However, by using a scheme similar to that of the pulse starters used for
some helium-neon and most argon/krypton ion lasers, it should be possible to
do away with the high voltage switch entirely.  See the sections starting
with: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns4">Starting Circuits Using Pulse or Flyback
Transformers</A> and <A HREF="laserapd.htm#apdipb">Igniters, Pulse, Bypass,
High Current High Voltage Diodes</A> for HeNe and Ar/Kr lasers, respectively.

<h3><A NAME="cmghvc">High Voltage Connections, Gas Lines, and Water
 Cooling</A></h3>
<p>
Some areas of concern that remain unresolved include high voltage insulation
with respect to gas supply lines and water cooling since the electrode
assemblies as described in the paper also come in contact with either the
gas or vacuum line, as well as the (optional) water jacket.
<ul>
<li>The electrode at one end of the tube is at ground potential and thus not a
 problem.  However, the electrode at the other end of the tube  must be driven
 from the 10 to 15 kV pulser (simple exciter or cascade system).  It also must
 connect to either the gas supply or vacuum line.  Since it is normally
 desirable to have an unrestricted path to the vacuum pump, this would also
 provide a nice alternative path to ground for the HV pulses.  Therefore, it
 would seem that the gas leak should be attached to the HV electrode.  One
 approach is to use gas control valves made of entirely of plastic.  The HV
 pulse will be effectively prevented from jumping to ground since the gas
 supply on the other side of the gas leak valve is at a much higher pressure
 and thus an effective insulator.  Just making the gas supply lines long
 enough may be enough if the breakdown voltage is greater than than of the
 tube's bore!
<p>
<li>If water cooling is used, the water jacket runs between the two
 electrodes.  Tap water is usually a pretty decent conductor of electricity,
 especially at 15 kV!  Unless a closed loop system using de-ionized water or
 other coolant is provided, I don't know what effect this would have either
 on performance or safety.  The other option is to provide an insulating
 barrier between the water and the electrode - possibly a thin plastic ring
 sealed with RTV Silicone.
</ul>
Just some things to consider!

It shows that the Florod Corporation actually did make Xenon lasers, I don't 
know about present day manufacturers.  (These are NOT excimer lasers - those
are in a different listing for Xenon Chloride and Xenon Fluoride lasers.)
<p>
The models listed all operated at wavelengths from 488 to 540 nm with a pulse
length of 4.5 us, beam diameter of 3 mm, and divergence of 3 mR.  Models LMT
and MFA could do 1 to 2 pulses per second; model MEL-30 up to 30 pps.
<p>
Krypton lasers were made by <A HREF="http://www.cohr.com/">Coherent, Inc.</A>
(at least through 1987).  This one is apparently NOT the same as a conventional
krypton ion CW laser but lases on one of the major krypton spectral lines:
Their Model I100K3/468-ASE operated at a wavelength of 647.1 nm at a repetition
rate of 7.6*10<sup>7</sup> pps, pulse energy of 8*10<sup>-9</sup> J, and
pulse length of less than 120 picoseconds (!!).  However, note that this is
NOT a pulsed tube but is mode-locked and cavity dumped resulting in a pulsed
output.  The beam diameter was 2 mm (TEM00) with a divergence of .5 mR.

<h3><A NAME="cmgcol">Comments on the Oxygen Laser</A></h3>

(From: Daniel Ames (dlames3@msn.com).)
<p>
Just want to mention some characteristics of the Oxygen Laser.
<p>
Oxygen will only lase in a pulsed mode. Back in 1971, some Canadian researchers
theorized that you could use ordinary air for the O2, but other researchers
back then found that other gases, including argon, only degraded the output
power.  Plus, air has a lot of moisture in it and other contaminates like
smoke, smog, dust, and whatever else is floating around. You would need one
heck of a special filter and drying system in order to keep from polluting the
laser cavity and fogging up the inside of the Brewster windows or optics.
And to make things worse, oxygen - especially hot ionized O2 - is very
reactive with metal electrodes and even with quartz glass tubing.  Welders'
grade oxygen would be the next purity grade up from just using plain vanilla
favor air.  I am not sure how much moister and other contaminants would be in
medical-grade O2.  Lab-grade O2 would of course be the ultimate choice but
it's much more expensive than just air. :)
<p>
Also, you would need to be very careful about what type of vacuum pump oil
you use especially if you are using a high RPM pump since: Oil + O2 + the
compression stroke in the vacuum pump = possible BOOM. Oxygen itself is not
explosive, but it sure makes anything that is flammable burn extremely well.
I am not trying to discourage anyone from attempting to build an oxygen laser,
just listing some of the basic concerns and cautions. It's definitely ~ a
challenge. :)
<p>
(From: James Sweet (jamessweet@hotmail.com).)
<p>
That's definitely a very good point, I've seen heavy machined brass oxy
welding regulators blown apart from small amounts of oil contamination
in the high pressure side.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Well I don't know how it is in your state but around here, Medical Grade O2 is
four nines, i.e., 99.9999% purity and must be checked for CO2, CO, etc.  The
goal is to build a low cost unit, and if you have to replace windows or cold
cathodes made from aluminum stock, that's cheap for the power you can get from
the unit.
<p>
The Canadian design for the oxygen laser is designed to have throw away,
easily replaceable electrodes and Brewsters, because its a pumped, not a
sealed laser, you can take some liberties on the tube design such as
brewsters held on with O-rings.  It's not like a argon ion laser where
everything has to be ultra-high vacuum and high temperature compatible.
Electrodes, optics, etc., are demountable, so you can clean or replace them.
The warning about O2 and pump oil is a good point, but you're bleeding so
little O2 through a leak valve that I wouldn't be too worried.  You also have
a leak valve on the pump side, otherwise the O2 regulator will just slam open
to about 25 psi and bleed all your O2 right into the pump. This is true with
any flowing gas system, both vacuum and source have to be throttled, otherwise
you loose all your gas in a few minutes. Usually even a dying pump is good
enough to suck the tube out fast. 
<p>
(From: Daniel.)
<p>
You brought up some good points about the method for gas regulation. :) I
found that a very small diameter capillary tube about 1" long inserted into
the 02 supply line and a needle valve downstream also works very well to
prevent the low pressure regulator from slamming open.   I am using a 5 psi
secondary regulator too. With this set up, I eliminate the possibility of over
pressuring the laser tube and gas supply lines, oooops. :(  Plus, this
way I can pull full vacuum during the initial pump down with my Welch 1402
pump (slow RPM). I admit that there are advantages to both gas flow
regulating methods. I would go with Steve's suggestion of using a metering valve
on the roughing line (pump side) if one is using a high RPM oil filled vacuum
pump or drying pump - (LN2 and molecular sieve).
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
The concerns about the potentially explosive nature of mixtures containing high
pressure oxygen are certainly valid.  However, given that these lasers run at
a Torr or less, as noted, the only danger would be due to carelessness or a
major leak or regulator/metering valve failure resulting in atmospheric
pressure O2 entering the vacuum system.

<h3><A NAME="cmgbcv">Bruce's Comments on Various Pulsed Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Bruce Tiemann (brucet@ctilidar.com).)
<p>
Just so you know where I'm coming from, I have built several N2 lasers at
home for fun, and one of them would lase open air at 1 atm giving at best,
about half the pulse energy, as perceived by eye, of the output when LN
boil-off was used.
<p>
In the section: <A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgcmg3">Home-Built PMG Laser
Description</A>, Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com) mentions that:
<p>
<blockquote>
"there is also a line at around 545 nm (or should this be the green HeNe line
 at 543.5 nm?) which will lase brightly in a transverse discharge similar to
 that of the nitrogen laser and also lase in a long tube but not as strong."
</blockquote>
<p>
I don't know about that wavelength, but I do understand, and you even admit
it in the chapter on the nitrogen laser, that neon lases at 540.1 nm in a fast
transverse discharge.  This might possibly be the line Steve is talking
about.  According to my refs, this line lases with about 1/10 the power of
the 337 nm nitrogen line in the same laser.
<p>
Additionally, I have built a PMG laser for a research project when in
college, years ago.  It was supposed to lase the Xe 3+ lines that you talk
about - but when there was an air leak, which was quite common before the
plumbing was fixed, you could see the discharge change color, and a strong
line at 409 nm - beautiful purple, would come up.  It was about as strong
as the Xe lines.  It was due to nitrogen, atomic neutrals I think.
<p>
This laser was Pyrex, had a 3 to 4 mm bore, approximately 60 cm long, was
pumped to several tens of microns pressure, and the discharge was a several
100s of pF, charged to several kV, with a repetition rate of between 30
and 100 Hz.  It had an indium cold cathode and a large foil-ring anode,
and blue-green mirrors, 99.9% and about 98% R. (Sorry, this laser was
nearly 20 years in the past.  I don't recall the exact details.)
<p>
It would also lase the Ar+ blue-green lines, at lower voltages and higher
tube pressures.
<p>
Back to the 409 nm line, of course if it were an air leak, it was lasing
79% N2, 20% O2, etc.  The output might have been more with pure nitrogen,
but I never tried it because I was supposed to be working on the xenon
laser.  However, there was a bottle of argon and I did try that.  BTW this
was in Bill Bridges's lab at Caltech, where I went.  (He invented the argon
ion laser and he probably suggested that I try Ar just for fun.)
<p>
This laser had silica Brewster windows and also lased several UV lines 200 to
400 nm with Xe filling at 50-70 microns pressure.
<p>
I have been an electronics and laser hobbyist for years, a ham (N6URH) and so
forth. I have been planning for years to build a monster TE laser,
primarily meant for 337 nm nitrogen, and it turns out there there are
dozens if not hundreds of lines that such a beast can lase.  Not only
Ne at 540.1 nm, but also hydrogen at 160 nm in the VUV, nitrogen
molecular ion at 428 nm, some other vis. lines in Ne, and lots and
lots of others.  Xe is supposed to give a very energetic ~3.3 (3.9?)
micron output in such a device, and you can lase nitrous oxide at 11
microns, and so forth.  There are also the excimer combinations, XeCl,
etc, and some unusual ones (XeO) that will also go.  I saved a bunch of
papers on all these lines, and a summary of them may be of interest to
you.  But of all of them, 337 nm nitrogen is nice because the gas is
benign and the wavelength satisfactorily useful. I have also pumped
home-brew dye lasers with my home-brew nitrogen lasers, including one
that had a diffraction grating mounted on a protractor as a cavity
mirror.  You could literally rotate the grating around, and change the
color, and then read off the angle of the grating from the protractor,
and calculate the implied operating wavelength.
<p>
Fun fun fun. :)

<h3><A NAME="cmgrfl">Mike's Notes on Refilling a Pulsed Ion Laser</A></h3>

While the following was written in response to a question about a specific
xenon ion laser, it should apply in general to a variety of other lasers.
<p>
(From: Mike Poulton (mpoulton@mtptech.com).)
<p>
I have no idea what the proper xenon pressure is, but I can tell you 
that it probably can't be mixed with any other gases.  Since helium has 
a much higher ionization energy than xenon, it might be okay, but don't 
count on it.  It's probably better to go with straight xenon.  A neon 
sign shop can probably do the filling work for you.  You can buy 1 liter 
glass vessels of xenon at 1 atm from some neon sign suppliers -- check 
around on the net.  I think they are about a hundred bucks.
<p>
Look for a local sign shop with only one location.  Shops with multiple 
locations do all their pumping at one, and are generally too busy to be 
bothered, even for money.  Small shops will often do this sort of thing, 
although it WILL cost you.  They will have to attach your xenon flask to 
the vacuum manifold.  If they have an extra spot on the manifold, which 
many places do, then it's no big deal.  If not, then it requires 
removing one of the flasks already attached (neon or argon), which 
wastes the rest of it ($14), and keeps them from using that gas as long 
as your xenon flask is attached.  Your xenon flask cannot be removed 
without wasting the rest of it.  They will probably have no use for 
xenon, and will want it off the manifold as soon as possible.  That
means you get one try -- you can't go back the next week and do it
again without buying another liter of xenon.
<p>
While the tube is under high vacuum (1 micron or less), it should be 
heated to 250 C or more to bake out impurities.  The neon guy will want 
to bombard it -- that would probably destroy the electrodes.  Instead, 
use a hand torch very carefully and slowly.  The tube probably ought to 
be partially refilled (to a few mm Hg) with xenon and then re-evacuated 
while hot to remove all impurities possible.
<p>
Now here's the cool part:  Slowly fill the tube with xenon with the 
power supply attached an operating, and the mirrors fairly well aligned 
(using a laser).  It sounds like a high-gain medium (pulsed high power 
emission) so getting some beam shouldn't be too hard.  You will probably 
want the capacitor to be at 4 kV or more, and have the trigger firing a 
couple times a second.  Mess with the pressure until you get the best 
discharge or (if you're real lucky) the best beam.
<p>
If you want to get tricky, try refilling the gas ballasts with xenon at a 
higher pressure than the tube.  Open the ballast valves, fill to fairly 
high pressure, close the valves, and pump down to optimum pressure.  
Note that you may have one gas ballast and one vacuum ballast to allow 
for pressure adjustments either way, in which case the vacuum ballast 
needs to be filled (emptied?) and sealed before filling the tube.  Play 
around.  You have no incentive to save xenon gas, since that remaining 
in the flask will be wasted when it is removed from the manifold.
<p>
Have I ever done this before?  Of course not.  I've never even seen a 
xenon laser.  However, I do know a good bit about gas discharge tubes 
and processing, and the neon industry.  This is an ad-hoc process 
omitting many important steps and details necessary for optimum tube 
life.  It's experimental, untried, and your mileage may vary.  Good luck.
