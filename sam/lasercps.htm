<h2>Basic Home-Built PSS Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cpscps0">Introduction to Home-Built PSS Laser</A></h3>

Among high power lasers, the Pulsed Solid State (PSS) laser is probably the
easiest to construct from components available on the surplus market.
A Nd:YAG rod in decent condition (flat polished ends without damage) can be
made to generate destructive amounts of pulsed energy at 1,064 nm (near-IR,
quite invisible) with relatively little effort as these things go. :)  Pump
energy, usually from xenon flashlamps, will be needed but it may be possible
for these to just be flash units from disposable cameras, appropriately
remounted to efficiently couple their light into the laser rod.  The HR
mirror doesn't need to be nearly perfect and the OC mirror doesn't need
to have that high a reflectivity (as with a HeNe laser) but with the amount
of photon flux circulating inside the cavity of a pulsed laser, any absorption
of light by the mirrors will result in heating and likely destruction of the
coatings on the first shot, if not sooner.
<p>
Nd:Glass is an alternative to Nd:YAG with similar lasing characteristics.
Its major benefit is the availability in large sizes at reasonable cost
(usually surplus from large Government laser projects).  However, the thermal
conductivity is much lower than YAG so repetition rates need to be much lower.
(This wasn't a problem with those huge lasers that fired once an hour!)
<p>
Ruby can also be used (it was, of course, the lasing material in the first
laser) and has both advantages and disadvantages.  On the plus side, the output
is visible (694 nm, deep red) and pumping is a bit easier because the flash
duration can be much longer.  However, the threshold to get lasing is much
higher for ruby (all other factors being equal) and its conversion efficiency
is much lower.  Being a 3 level rather than 4 level system (like YAG), the
entire rod needs to be pumped or else unpumped regions will absorb any laser
light which may result in an unusably high threshold and greatly reduced
output.
<p>
A variety of other laser crystals can be used but probably don't offer
significant advantages unless you are interested in the particular wavelength
they generate.  Three common types are Erbium:YAG (Er:YAG, lases at 2,940 nm),
Er:Glass (1,540 nm), and Holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG, 2,100 nm).  They are likely to
be less common on the surplus market than either Nd:YAG or ruby.  But, due to
lower popularity, may be available at attractive prices.
<p>
The power supply for a pulsed solid state laser consists of a Pulse Forming
Network (PFN), capacitor charger, and flashlamp trigger circuit.  Detailed
information can be found in the chapters starting with:
<A HREF="lasersps.htm#spstoc">SS Laser Power Supplies</A>.
<p>
However, note that like the home-built diode pumped solid state laser,
constructing a PSS laser truly from scratch is way out of the question
onless you are willing to do the glass work and gas filling of a custom
flashlamp lamp and work for a laser crystal company to fabricate, grind,
polish the rod. :)  So, you may feel that a PSS laser doesn't offer enough
of a challenge or reward without being able to say you did everything from
the the ground up.  Building one for $10 is also probably not realistic
although with a bit of ingenuity, the costs can be kept quite low.  I do
consider a PSS laser to be worthy of home-built laser status as long as we're
talking about dealing with the individual components (rod, lamp(s), mirrors,
cavity reflector, power supply, etc.).  You will need to decide whether
just hooking up an M60 rangefinder ruby laser head or SSY1 Nd:YAG laser head
to a home-built capacitor charger and PFN qualifes. :)
<p>
Much of the information in this chapter also applies to arc lamp and halogen
lamp pumped SS Nd:YAG (the material that would be most suitable) lasers.  
However, with the increasing popularity of high power laser diodes as pump
sources, CW lamp pumped lasers are rapidly losing their appeal due to their
HUGE power requirements and waste heat, and terrible efficiency.  Therefore,
there will be little or no specific information on these beasts.

<h3><A NAME="cpssaf">Home-Built PSS Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are three areas of safety considerations for the home-built pulsed
solid state laser:
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built PSS laser generates light
 intense enough to be both a vision and heat/fire hazard from the output beam.
 The xenon flashlamp may also produce enough UV (aside from the bright light)
 to be a risk but this is normally contained by the cavity reflector and is
 therefore not much of an issue even during testing.
<p>
 The output beam should be fully enclosed if possible (especially where it is
 well collimated at the output of the rod) to avoid any possibility  of eye
 contact with the direct or reflected beam as well as damage to property.
 Access should be restricted to the focal point of any focusing optics.
 Even if not focused, a small PSS laser can char darker materials and the
 focused beam will blow holes in many things.
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supply is high voltage with significant
 energy storage.  It has been estimated that 60 J is required to kill
 an average adult human with much lower values being lethal under the wrong
 conditions.  There is no second chance.  Even the 120 uF, 330 V capacitors
 in disposable camera flash units can be deadly.
<p>
 Power supplies should include safety interlocks and automatic bleeders when
 any cover is removed.  All connections should be more than adequately
 insulated to prevent accidental contact.
<p>
 If you are using water cooling (probably not likely except for a VERY large
 system) - either tap water or a closed loop system, make sure that water
 circulation paths are well insulated from the high voltage and that all
 fittings are securely grounded.  Tap water is a fairly good conductor of
 electricity - think of it as a very soft wire. :)  Unless you have a totally
 closed system filled with 100 percent distilled de-ionized water, there can
 be enough current flow to be lethal.  Water and electricity do not mix!
</ul>

Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.
<p>
For more information, see the chapter: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser
Safety</A>.  Sample safety labels which can be edited for this laser can be
found in the section: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saflslbl">Laser Safety Labels
and Signs</A>.

<h3><A NAME="cpscps1">PSS Laser Construction References and
 Links</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>There are complete plans for pulsed ruby lasers in the Iannini books ([2]
 and [3] in the section: <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirbks">Books, Collections,
 Other publications</A>).  They appear virtually the same as far as lasing
 energy is concerned but there are some electrical and mechanical differences.
<p>
<li>Nuts and Volts magazine has had several articles on the
 construction of a pulsed ruby laser in 2003.  Their monthly series:
 "Laser Insight" appears to provide very complete and detailed
 electronic plans but are somewhat incomplete with respect to the
 actual laser head - rod, flashlamp, mirrors, etc.  However, this may be due
 in part to the uncertainty in availability of reasonably priced
 (e.g., surplus, eBay, etc.) optical components.  So, rather than
 specifying a set of parts that could only likely be acquired new for
 $5,000, the author keeps it somewhat general.

 same league as Information Unlimited. (See the section:

<li>And, of course, before attempting to build your own PSS or other solid
 state laser, see the relevant chapters on basic principles and commercial
 systems starting with: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssltoc">Solid State Lasers</A>.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="cpscps3">Home-Built PSS Laser Description</A></h3>

The PSS laser described below should be capable of producing output pulses of
up to 1 joule or more if high quality components are used in its construction.
Now, 1 J may not sound like much except that it will be generated in about 100
us representing a peak power of over 10,000 W!  This will easily put holes in
aluminum soda cans and possibly razor blades (a rating of 1 Gillette) in a
single shot when its output is focused with a short focal length positive
lens.  With the addition of a Q-switch (not shown), peak powers of 100s of
MEGAWATTs may be possible.  In either case, it will also put holes in
things you value more than soda cans and razor blades - like the back
of your eyeballs - so take care!  The power supply is also quite lethal.
<p>
As noted previously, for a YAG laser, the specific sizes/ratings of the
components aren't at all critical.  A wide variety of designs will result in a
working PSS laser, possibly with better performance than the one shown.
Thus, don't restrict your search for the YAG rod, flashlamp, and optics to
those shown in the diagram or described below.  Matching the lengths of the
rod and flashlamp will be best, but for YAG, it isn't critical.  Using a
2 inch flashlamp with a 3 inch rod should still work.  (With ruby, a 3-level
laser, unpumped regions of the rod absorb the laser light and if a ruby rod
isn't fully pumped, result in a much higher threshold or inability to lase
at all).  Of course with either, using a flashlamp that is too long is just
wasting photons. :)
<p>

for a simplified diagram of a typical laser head.
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall - M.
  <li>Fabrication - L.
  <li>Power supply - M.
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - Depends on solid state lasing medium.  Most common
 are Nd:YAG at 1,064 nm (near-IR) and ruby at 694.1 nm (deep red).  A KTP
 frequency doubling crystal may be used with YAG to produce 532 nm (green)
 output.
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium - Nd:YAG or ruby rod.
<p>
  <li>Rod diameter - 1/4" (6.4 mm); rod length - 3" (76 mm).
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air cooling.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Anti-Reflection (AR) coatings on ends of laser rod desirable
   but not essential.
<p>
  <li>Mirrors - Planar dielectric mirrors, 15 mm diameter.  HR totally
   reflecting at 1,064 nm or 694.1 nm (as appropriate); OC 70% to 90% at the
   same wavelength.  (A prism-type retro-reflector will also work for the HR.)
   It may be possible to use a high quality aluminized mirror for the HR but I
   don't know how long it will survive due to the high intra-cavity photon
   flux - possibly not beyond the first shot.  Alignment is best done with a
   low power HeNe laser.  See the section:
   <A HREF="lasercps.htm#cpsalgn">Home-Built PSS Laser Alignment and
   Optimization</A>.
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length (mirror to mirror) - 7" (178 mm).
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required - none.
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - Xenon flash lamp.  One possibility is the EG&G/Perkin-Elmer
   FXQ-1302-3:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Bore diameter (ID): 0.157 inches/4 mm.
 <li>Arc length: 3 inches/76 mm.
 <li>Total length: 5.56 inches/141.2 mm.

 <li>Minimum trigger voltage: 12 KV (series), 15 KV (external).
 <li>Explosion energy: 360 J (100 us), 1,170 J (1 ms).
 </ul>
<p>
  <li>Cavity reflector - Polished cylindrical ellipsoidal reflector made from
   sheet metal (e.g., chrome or gold plated aluminum, brass, or steel) used to
   focus flashlamp light onto laser rod.  I don't know if metalized Mylar will
   survive for long but you can try that in a pinch.  Wrapping the lamp and rod
   in degreased aluminum foil, polished side inward, would also work, though
   perhaps not quite as well as a properly shaped reflector.  It can also be
   used as the trigger electrode for the flashlamp - just keep the ends clear
   of the flashlamp electrodes!
<p>
  <li>Power supply - Pulse forming network and capacitor charger.  Input
   energy to flashlamp of up to 100 J (64 uF, 17 uH, 1,800 V).  External
   (shown) or series triggering.

<h3><A NAME="cpscps4">Sources of Special Parts and Supplies for the Home-Built
 PSS Laser</A></h3>

For capacitors and other power supply related items, see the chapter:
<A HREF="lasersps.htm#spstoc">SS Laser Power Supplies</A>.  The following
deals with sources for flashlamps, laser rods, and optics - which would
be the major laser surplus places and eBay.  You won't find this stuff in
Radio Shack or even Edmund Scientific.  Buying new is probably out of the
question for most of us - a typical flashlamp will go for several $100 and a
small YAG rod for several $1,000.
<p>
<b>Flashlamps:</b>
<p>
The best types of flashlamps are those designed for laser pump applications.
They are generally of higher quality than the type in that disposable camera
flash and are constructed with materials to handle higher energy and pass the
wavelengths needed for pumping laser rods.  You'll also want a flashlamp with
an arc length approximately equal to the length of your laser rod.  This will
result in highest efficiency for any laser but is particularly critical for
ruby.  If the lamp is too short, unpumped regions will absorb any laser light
which may result in an unusably high threshold and greatly reduced output.
Note that while a helical flashlamp may look 'cool', it's generally easier
to deal with linear flashlamps for pumping laser rods - too much light energy
is lost to reflections from the coils and out the ends of the cavity even if a
perfect reflector surrounds them.  And, the long discharge path means helical
flashlamps will tend to have larger Ko values and thus require higher voltage
to achieve the same pulse width.
<p>
The "gold standard" for flashlamps has been EG&G (now Perkin-Elmer) but many
other companies make similar lamps.  (See the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslegg">EG&G 1300 Series Linear Flashlamp
Specifications</A>.)  Needless to say, these are very expensive
if purchased new.
<p>
Laser pump flashlamps can often be found at the major laser surplus places as
well as on eBay.  However, make sure that what is listed is actually a
flashlamp and not an arc lamp - the latter won't survive for long when driven
in pulsed mode!  Sellers frequently don't know the difference.  The only sure
way to know is from the part number though high power arc lamps tend to have
one pointed electrode and better coupling between the electrodes and exterior
for improved heat transfer.
<p>
For a small PSS laser, common photographic flashlamps available from major
electronics distributors like <A HREF="http://www.digikey.com/">DigiKey</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.mouser.com/">Mouser</A> and electronics surplus places
may in fact be adequate, if not ideal.  These may be suited for ruby with its
long fluorescence lifetime so the pulse width can be long thus reducing stress
on the flashlamp and allowing regular electrolytic capacitors to be used in the
PFN.  However, this is offset somewhat by the much lower threshold inherent
with YAG where the flash unit from a disposable camera may be adequate to pump
a 1 to 1.5 inch YAG rod.
<p>
<b>Laser rods:</b>
<p>
Ideally, what you want are never used rods with ground, polished, and AR
(Anti-Reflection) or mirror coated ends.  Except for the AR coatings, this is
essential - you aren't going to do optical quality finishing work
in your basement!  If the seller doesn't explicitly say this, ask.
It's possible to use rods without AR coatings.  However,
efficiency and stability may be slightly lower if they are not cut at the
Brewster angle.  Getting rods with at least one of the mirrors already on
the end of the rod will certainly simplify the laser design but these are
not very common.
<p>
In particular, avoid those from eBay seller ID ninteach whose "Military
Surplus" rods are probably good only to cut up for jewelry or as conversation
pieces, but not for lasers.  (He may also be selling the same junk under other
eBay user IDs selling the same junk.)  It's quite amazing what uninformed
people will pay for these!  $15 for a garbage rod to experiment with or as a
curiosity might be reasonable.  But I've seen them go for $150 or more!  Some
of the specific known problems with these include:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Impurities/inclusions in the crystal.  These result in refraction of
 the light inside the rod.
<p>
<li>Rough ground but not polished ends.  Optical grade polishing will be
 costly.  This isn't something you are likely to be able to do in your
 basement.
<p>
<li>Significant non-uniform diameter.  This will result in non-uniform
 pump energy in the interior.
</ol>
<p>
Aside from the tint of the material, a high quality rod with polished and
AR coated ends should just about disappear when viewed lengthwise.  The
interior should be crystal-clear with absolutely no distortion.
<p>
Realistically, most of the rods available at reasonable cost for home-built
PSS lasers are going to be used and in varying states of health but most
should be adequate if in good physical condition.  However, that may take
some careful inpsection to identify.  In particular, damage to the rod
ends (AR coatings or mirrors) and possibly thermal induced microfractures
at the ends or internally.  But rods pulled from commercial lasers when their
output energy/power falls below spec'd values will likely have a lot
of life left.  And, sometimes, they will be replaced as a "shotgun"
fix along with the mirrors or other optics - which may have been the
actual problem.  Thus the rods will often be nearly good as new.
<p>
Some people claim the existence of such a thing as a depleted rod, and it
has nothing to do with nuclear reactors!  The idea is that somehow, the
Nd in the rod migrates from where it is supposed to be to somewhere else
after long use.  A senior engineer at Synoptics and a retired engineer
from Union Carbide both agree that this is an urban myth despite claims
from some others whose information is normally reliable.  If anyone has
additional comments or references on this topic, please contact me via
the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
Laser surplus places like <A HREF="http://www.mi-lasers.com/">Meredith
Instruments</A> and others may carry ruby, Nd:YAG, and sometimes, other
strange laser rods.  Since these are usually not continuously stocked items
but come and go, checking back from time-to-time will be desirable.  In any
case, I'd recommend sticking with the common lasing materials even if you
find something else cheap.  YAG is easiest to make lase but its output is
invisible.  Ruby produces visible output but has a higher threshold.
Optics for both of these are likely to be more readily available than for
others.  A bargain rod isn't a bargain if everything else costs more!
<p>
And if you're determined to have the biggest laser on your block, check
out <A HREF="http://www.laser-rods.com/">Neodymium Glass</A>.  They must
have gotten surplus optics from the older Livermore lasers.
<p>
Laser rods turn up quite frequently on eBay, both pulls from equipment and
never used (NOS, New Old Stock).  Monitoring auctions with the words "laser",
and "YAG" or "ruby" (as desired) shouldn't take too much time.
<p>
<b>Optics:</b>
<p>
The HR can be either a totally reflecting high energy dielectric mirror or a
roof prism or corner reflector, AR coated for the laser wavelength if
possible.  A high quality first surface aluminized mirror might survive
for a few shots or more but with the high intra-cavity power of a PSS
laser, possibly not for long.  And, probably not at all if Q-switched!
<p>
The OC mirror really needs to be one designed for PSS laser.  Without a
Q-switch, figure something like 70 percent reflectivity at the lasing
wavelength.  With a Q-switch, it can be as low as 30 percent.  I'd suggest
avoiding "resonant" type mirrors in favor of high energy dielectric types.
While resonant optics have no coatings to be damaged, their internal optical
element spacing and alignment are absolutely critical (if disassembled for any
reason, will likely be ruined).  And, their condition or even effective
reflectivity can't easily be determined.  The reflectivity is also likely to
be too low for useful operation without a Q-switch.  Although the original
ruby laser, circa 1960, used an aluminum output mirror with a hole in the
middle, this is probably not a great idea (but it wouldn't hurt to try!).
<p>
Laser surplus places and eBay are the likely sources unless you are willing
to pay big $$$ for them.
<p>
(From: Chris Leubner (cdleubner@ameritech.net).)
<p>
I have found that some of the IR attenuators out of very old color
video cameras work as a half way descent OC for those ruby lasers, You need
the type that are made of clear glass with a reddish mirror coating, the
blue ones will not work.

<h2>Other Examples of Home-Built PSS Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cpsmyl">Mini YAG Laser using SSY1 Optics and SG-SP1</A></h3>

I (Sam) was given a cute little YAG cavity including a 50 mm long 3 mm diameter
Nd:YAG rod with AR coated ends and a flashlamp similar to that used in SSY1.
Coupling from the flashlamp to the rod is probably better than in SSY1 -
there, a noticeable percentage of the flashlamp light escapes out the sides
of the white powder covered non-reflective transparent cavity.  This one has
a highly polished elliptical reflector.
<p>
So, I built a resonator using some scrap aluminum with a pair of simple
adjustable mirror mounts with SSY1 mirrors (from a defunct SSY1 - whereabouts
of rod and flashlamp unknown).  I mounted a 20 mm focal length focusing lens
in front of the OC mirror.
<p>
The original flashlamp was apparently supposed to be triggered using
a series pulse technique.  I prefer external triggering so I added a fine
wire running along the side of the flashlamp for the trigger transformer
I use with PFN1.  Triggering works great. :)
<p>
Alignment was the real pain with all the weak reflections (HR, OC, and rod,
front and rear, and both mirrors were ground with wedge).  But, I was able to
smoke black electrical tape when focused on the first try using the SSY1 PFN1
at 800 to 900 V (approximately 10 to 15 J input energy).  I'ms sure alignment
isn't optimal though.  The output energy seems similar to that of SSY1, maybe
a bit better on black tape (nice wisps of smoke), not quite as good on
aluminum foil.  Without a Q-switch, the output pulse is longer and of lower
peak power which may be the main factor.  (The behavior does appear similar to
that of SSY1 with its Q-switch removed.)  I will really need to have some
sort of energy meter though to optimize alignment.  This could possibly be
done with just a photodiode centered on the optical axis with the beam spread
out (to reduce peak power to the photodiode) monitoring the current on a
scope.
<p>
Summary of specifications:
<ul>
<li>Rod: Nd:YAG 50 mm long, 3 mm in diameter.  AR coated both ends.
<li>Flashlamp: Similar to the one used in SSY1 but with a slightly longer arc
 length (approximately 2 inches).
<li>Power supply: SG-SP1 (15 J max, pushbutton external triggering).
<li>Firing rate: 1 pulse/second max at 15 J input.
<li>Cavity reflector: Elliptical polished gold plated metal.
<li>Mirrors: SSY1 HR and OC in home-built adjustable mounts.
<li>Distance between mirrors: 6 inches.
</ul>

I did get my first coherent photons from it just the other evening. I am in
need of some good YAG resonant optics to maximize this laser's performance, as
efficiency is not very high right now. The best I've done so far has been a
0.97 joule output pulse with an input of 200 joules. This was read with my
questionably calibrated Ophir laser power meter.  I will try to get some
pictures of this laser soon.

I do plan on the passive Q-switching of this laser in the future. My 'ever
cheap plan' is to construct a small quartz dye chamber placed near, or as a
part of, the high reflector and employ an organic dye suitable for YAG
Q-switching within this cell.

<p>
Well after several weeks of construction I finally got my ruby laser
working.  See <A HREF="sbrl1.jpg">Sinebar's Ruby Laser</A>.
I don't know how much power it is putting out but I think
it is probably somewhat modest.  The ruby rod is 3" x 1/4" and the
ends are dielectric coated.  The HR end is 99.9% reflective and the OC
end is 55% reflective.  I am using the PFN that was originally used
for the Hughes range finder.  Cap is 150 uF, 1250 V.  I think that
is about 117 joules.  The power supply is from a bug
zapper.  The external trigger consists of a small trigger transformer
and a simple circuit that charges a capacitor which dumps voltage across the
primary of the trigger transformer when a button is pushed.  The laser
cavity I robbed off a Hughes range finder as well as the flashlamp.
In fact, I used quite a bit of the rangefinder parts.  I put
everything in a nice wood box that gives it a kind of old timey look.

Hopefully, Jarrod will provide description of the complete laser
in the future.  For now, be happy with the pics! :)

I have built a high power pulsed laser, capable of
vaporizing certain materials with a single shot. The beam will cut a hole
through a razor blade while producing a shower of sparks. When striking
the surface of carbon or charcoal, the beam produces a plume of fire.

<h3><A NAME="cpsalgn">Home-Built PSS Laser Alignment and Optimization</A></h3>

Initial alignment is best done with a low power HeNe laser reflecting from
the relevant surfaces of the HR and OC mirrors back to its output aperture.
Although alignment isn't nearly as difficult or critical for this short wide
bore laser as for a long narrow bore HeNe laser, the multiple weak reflections
from all of the nearly transparent (for visible wavelengths) surfaces can be
confusing (since the actual mirror reflections may not appear significantly
different at the red HeNe wavelength than uncoated surfaces or AR coated
surface at IR wavelengths).  The trick is to identify the relevant pair!
Since all surfaces are planar, sharpness/fuzzyness of the spot can't be used
as an identifier.  To simplify things, assuming the rod has planar ends that
are perpendicular to the rod axis, it can be removed for initial alignment
eliminating two confusing surfaces.  And, putting a drop of water, alcohol, or
a strategically placed fingerprint :) on the back of the HR will scramble any
reflection from its rear surface and remove it from consideration.
<p>
Detecting the beam and optimizing alignment can be done by checking the beam
profile with Zapit(tm) paper, thermal fax or printer paper, a photocopy
of a black original, other black paper, or black electrical tape, and
maximizing hole-blasting effectiveness. ;-)

<h3><A NAME="cpslpgr">Converting a Lamp Pumped IR YAG Laser to Green?</A></h3>

Multiwatt Halogen, arc lamp, or flashlamp pumped solid state lasers are
readily available at reasonable prices from laser surplus outfits, eBay, and
elsewhere.  What about adding a KTP (or other SHG crystal) and getting them
to output nice 532 nm green?  (Similar comments apply to higher harmonics
but the difficulty level increases significantly.)  While this would appear
at first to be an easy project, the realities may be quite different.  There
are a number of issues all relating to peak power density available and
shape of the beam inside the crystal.  Maximum harmonic power will be
generated when a narrow polarized collimated beam is properly phase matched
to the KTP (Type-II critical phase matching).  If the original laser isn't
polarized (e.g., Nd:YAG without Brewster angled rod ends), adding a polarizing
element will significantly increase performance.  Since harmonic generation is
a non-linear process, it is desirable to maximize power density so long as it
is safely less than the damage threshold of the KTP.
<p>
Lamp pumped SS lasers often use flat-flat resonators to prevent hot spots
inside the YAG rod.  The intra and output beams both have a large diameter
(almost equal to the rod diameter) and are massively multi (transverse) mode.
Just inserting a KTP crystal into the beam (inside or outside the cavity)
without taking into these factors and peak power density of the beam will
likely result in either poor performance or damage to the KTP.  With the
multimode beam, it isn't sufficient to just consider the average power
density in the beam cross-section - peak power in the hot spots due to the
sub-beams must be taken into account.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>CW SS lasers:</b> External doubling will probably be very inefficient
 even with careful beam shaping due to the limited maximum power density
 available.  Intracavity doubling may be possible but will probably require
 additional optics to achieve a narrow beam waist inside the KTP.
<p>
<li><b>Non-Q-switched pulsed SS lasers:</b> Intracavity or external doubling
 may be possible depending on peak power and beam structure.  It may just be
 a matter of inserting a KTP crystal in the appropriate location.
<p>
<li><b>Q-switched pulsed or quasi-CW SS lasers:</b> Due to the extremely high
 peak power of Q-switched laser pulses, external doubling will probably be
 quite efficient but selection of the proper beam waist is most critical
 to avoiding destruction of the KTP.
</ul>

In short, this may be possible but don't expect miracles, at least not unless
the conversion is carefully designed and executed.

<h3><A NAME="cpsfpcc">Flashlamp Pumping of Composite Crystals</A></h3>

(From: r_isarin.)
<p>
I know that those hybrid vanadate crystals used in green laser pointers
(Nd:YVO4 and KTP) will lase when you let a camera flash go off within
a few cm of the pump surface.  I really didn't expect anything to
happen, thinking that this was about lasers and nothing with lasers is
ever easy.  I first tried it with the flash of my digital camera, then with the
flash unit of a disposable camera. Both worked without any attempt at
focusing the flashlight on the crystal, up to about 3 cm from the
surface. I didn't dare try playing with any means of focusing, scared
that I might ruin the laser crystal or the mirrors.
<p>
I did a very rough energy calculation, gross assumptions
made here and there.  Please correct me if I'm off by more than a
galaxy. ;o)
<p>
Based on flash cap capacity and voltage drop before and after the
flash, there's about 6 Joules going into the flash tube. I have no idea
about the efficiency of a small (tiny?) xenon tube, but assuming 50%
(probably way too much), there's 3 J available in light. Of that light, maybe
2% has the appropriate wavelength for effectively pumping the vanadate.
Also, with the (lack of) construction in this setup, at least 95% of
the light misses the vanadate completely, leaving only 3 mJ being used for
lasing. With an oscilloscope measured flash duration of about 0.4 ms
(FWHM), this results in 7.5 W average pulse power. I still have to put
both flash and laser output in the same 'scope shot, to compare input
and output. These 7.5 W are spread over the entire 5 square mm (the
edges of the crystal are slightly ragged and the mirror coating is a
circle just touching the edges) of the vanadate. That's 1.5 W per sq.
mm not counting whatever light may enter from the sides of the vanadate.
Using diode pumping, Pd = about 150 mW (estimate), focus spot size
is about 0.002 square mm. (another estimate), the power density is
75 W/square mm. Even if my calculations are off by a factor 50, the
flash pumping is still equal to the usual diode pump. I do suspect
that I'm on the low side with my numbers for the
flash pumping, or vanadate thresholds even easier than I thought.
About the green output, divide your results by 8 or 10 again...
<p>
For what it's worth...
