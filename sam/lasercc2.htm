<h2>Basic Home-Built CO2 Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cc2cc20">Introduction to Home-Built CO2 Laser</A></h3>

The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser is the powerhouse for high tech industrial
cutting and welding of metals and many other materials.  Small CO2 lasers are
used for marking of metal, wood, and composites, and in medicine and surgery.
Even a 'small' CO2 laser produces 10s of watts of beam power and the largest
are in the 100 kW range!
<p>
Its output is at 10.6 um (10,600 nm) or mid-IR.  This wavelength is about 10
to 30 times longer than the other lasers under discussion and often considered
a source of a heat beam than a light beam.  At this wavelength, normal glass
and plastic optics are either too lossy or totally opaque so alternatives must
be found both for the end-mirrors and any other mirrors, lenses, or prisms
required by the external optical setup.  Divergence/diffraction effects are
also increased by this same factor so obtaining a collimated beam is also more
difficult.
<p>
Many common materials including wood, paper, plastics, composites, and
properly prepared metal surfaces absorb quite well at this wavelength so the
CO2 laser makes an effective marking, cutting, welding, and heat treating
tool.
<p>
See the chapter: <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2toc">Carbon Dioxide Lasers</A> for
more information on the characteristics and applications of these devices.
<p>
It is possible for an amateur to construct a working axial flow CO2 laser
(non-sealed, see the chapter: <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2toc">Carbon Dioxide
Lasers</A>) in the 10 to 50 W range without too much difficulty - at least
compared to some of the other types of lasers described in this chapter.  A
vacuum system is needed but the range of operating vacuum is modest - 10 to
100 Torr.  And while several gases are needed, the purity of the final gas
fill isn't nearly as critical as for, say, the HeNe laser, and pre-mixed gas
is readily available.  See the section: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concll4">More on
Obtaining Gases</A>.
<p>
With a bit of resourcefulness, no fancy glass work is needed.  The power supply
can be just a neon sign transformer on a Variac.  The required mechanical
precision isn't as great either so even if your machining skills are quite
limited, adequate mirror mounts and structural components can be fabricated
relatively easily.  And, unlike the other traditional gas lasers (HeNe, Ar/Kr
ion, HeHg, CuCl/CuBr, and the like), once constructed and aligned, the CO2
laser requires minimal maintenance and can potentially be a useful tool for
real applications IFF it is packaged appropriately and provided with essential
safety interlocks and protection devices.  In fact, some commercial axial flow
CO2 lasers are just refined versions of what an amateur can build.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2des">Descriptions of Typical Small Flowing
Gas CO2 Lasers</A>.
<p>
My only complaint about CO2 lasers in general are that the beam is totally
invisible and boring in some ways. :-)  Otherwise, it is nearly the perfect
choice for a home-built laser - high power, continuous operation, and relative
simplicity!
<p>
<h3><A NAME="cc2mre">More on the Effort Required and Recommended Power
 Output</A></h3>

The following comments should be taken in a positive way in an attempt to
head off a disappointing experience for someone who really hasn't caught
the amateur laser construction bug.
<p>
Although, constructing a CO2 laser is easy relative to other types of lasers,
it is still NOT easy in an absolute sense.  You will have to make a very
considerable commitment of time and effort including dealing with the
frustrations when, as is inevitable, some things don't quite go according to
the script!  The costs in $$$ can quickly become significant as well if you
don't already have any of the supporting equipment (e.g., vacuum pump, power
supply components) and aren't a first rate scrounger. :)
<p>
If all you want is a reliable working laser, save your money and buy a used
CO2 laser system.  Something similar to what you will be building can probably
be acquired for under $1,000, perhaps less depending on your resourcefulness
and luck.  For example, see the section: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpsnsw9">How to
Get a Laser Without Really Trying - Part 1</A>.  If you can afford a bit more,
try to find a sealed tube CO2 laser system.  These have essentially zero
maintenance, and no requirements for a gas supply or vacuum system.  New
systems in the 25 W range can be had for around $5,000 from companies like
<A HREF="http://www.Parallax-tech.com/">Parallax Technologies</A>.  This
is certainly not cheap but may be in the ball park once all your costs
and time are factored into the equation.  However, note that in either case,
there could still be considerable costs associated with the beam delivery
system for your application.  For example, focusing lenses to get power to
that wood stock can easily run an additional several hundred dollars.
<p>
You may easily spend hundreds of hours in constructing a working CO2 laser -
especially if it is your first home-built laser.  Note that while this estimate
may seem high, it doesn't only include the actual fabrication of the laser
head itself (tube, mirror mounts, and frame) but the effort required to
select, acquire, and set up the vacuum system, gas supply and metering system,
power supply and possible added branch circuit(s) to handle the electrical
load, cooling system, and support structure (stable table or frame).  And,
providing and preparing the physical space: The home-built CO2 laser is not
likely to be in any way portable and the kitchen table does not make a good
work area. :)  Once everything is put together, all the leaks are plugged, the
parts that got trashed in shipping are replaced, you will have to align the
mirrors (best done with a helium-neon laser - another expensive if you don't
own one already), start feeding gases, apply power, and hope everything holds
together!
<p>
Even after you achieve 'first light' (or I suppose, more correctly, 'first
IR'), you will then spend countless more hours in getting the laser to be a
reliable system - and it is quite conceivable that this goal may forever be
elusive.  If your heart isn't in the laser construction aspects of this
endeavor, you will get discouraged very quickly.
<p>
If you DO decide to build your own CO2 laser, don't shoot for the stars, at
least not at first.  Begin with a modest size tube of say, 2 feet in length,
which should still be good for perhaps 20 or 30 watts.  There won't be any
problems powering it with a 12 to 15 kV neon sign transformer and it will be
small enough to easily fabricate - and store!  Once you have gotten that
operational, you will have solved all the tricky problems of vacuum, gas
supply, mirror mounts, and cooling.  It is easy to scale up something that
works.  However, starting with grandiose plans that fizzle will just lead to
a box full of parts and equipment gathering dust in the attic.... :-(
<p>
(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)  
<p>
Just to keep the expectations down, and also re-capping on the reason why we
are building lasers in the first place.
<p>
For those who are building lasers for use as a tool, e.g., for metal or
wood cutting, please be aware that you will be introducing a number of
factors that will make it difficult for the final application.
<p>
Lasers for cutting applications should be producing a considerable amounts of
power (around 100 Watts and up) to achieve a nice clean cut.  At lower powers,
it will take longer for the laser to cut the material, either if thin metal
and or wood, and will cause burning and/or bad cuts. Another reason for having
output powers in this range, is that at this wavelength, materials will behave
differently (in terms of light behaviour) certain materials will reflect the
IR energy, thus you are loosing energy through partial reflections.
<p>
Cutting lasers generally have to be very rouged, so to be resistant to
fibrations that can cause mis-alignment of the optics.
<p>
Commercial CO2 lasers, are built so to be quite resistant to environmental
changes. Also, many of the controls like vacuum, voltage/current, gas
pressures/mixtures are electronically controlled.
<p>
For cutting applications, the laser beam must also be directed to the work
piece, and this is done through an articulated arm - an optical waveguide. At
the end of the arm, is the objective lens. These optics require to be enhanced
for higher power IR beams, also it's not very easy at all, nor that trivial to
build an articulated arm from scratch - much alignment involved.
<p>
Please be aware, that home built lasers are much more sensitive to
vibrations, and are not of the 'plug-in and leave' variety. Home built
lasers require much TLC, adjustments and continual tweeking, plus there
is other things that have to be taken into consideration like: gas supply,
mixture and gas pressure; power supply; mirror/tube adjustments and mounts;
and thermal expansion and stability of the overall laser assembly.

<h3><A NAME="cc2saf">Home-Built CO2 Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are three areas of safety considerations for the home-built CO2 laser
(and other similar lasers, for that matter):
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built CO2 laser producing high power
 infra-red radiation at a wavelength of 10.6 um.  Almost any working CO2 laser
 - almost no matter how inefficient or misadjusted - will generate at least
 several WATTs of output power with scaled up designs similar to the SciAm
 laser capable of 100 W or more.  This is enough to burn things like property,
 clothing, and flesh (including the structures you value at the front of your
 eyeballs).
<p>
 Take precautions to avoid exposure to the direct or reflected beam.  Since it
 is invisible, this means clearly labeling where it is and enclosing these in
 materials opaque to 10.6 um IR (these include glass and most plastics so it
 isn't that hard and doesn't obscure the action.  Just because you can't see
 it, don't assume there is nothing there!
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supplies can be lethal.  Both AC and DC neon
 sign transformer based power supplies have enough voltage and current to stop
 a heart,  Even if you aren't killed, the shock may startle you into doing
 something you might regret.  Make sure you read and follow the
 <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered
 Equipment</A>.  Insulate all connections and install barriers to prevent
 contact with the high voltage.
<p>
 If you are using water cooling - either tap water or a closed loop system,
 make sure that water circulation paths are well insulated from the high
 voltage and that all fittings are securely grounded.  Tap water is a fairly
 good conductor of electricity - think of it as a very soft wire. :)  Unless
 you have a totally closed system filled with 100 percent distilled de-ionized
 water, there can be enough current flow to be lethal.  Water and electricity
 do not mix!
<p>
<li><b>Hazardous substances:</b> While the lasing gases (helium, nitrogen, and
 carbon dioxide) are not toxic, and are used in only small qunatities, there
 can always be leaks in the gas delivery system.  CO2 in particular is heavier
 than air so it will displace air in an enclosed space which may result in
 various symptoms from nausea to asphyxiation.  Make sure you have adequate
 ventilation.  In addition, if you are generating any of these gases (rather
 than using separate tanks or pre-mix), acids or other caustic chemicals may
 be involved.  Finally, the materials from which some of the optical
 components are made (like zinc selenide) may be biohazards if broken, ground,
 or even polished (more below).  So, don't figure on making your own mirrors,
 windows, or lenses from this material.  In addition, if you've inherited a
 commercial laser, it may use structural materials like beryllia for the bore,
 also a serious biohazard if broken or ground.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserarg.htm#argbcs3">Ion Laser Bore Temperature, Materials, and
 BeO Warning</A> - written for ion lasers in particular but applies here as
 well).
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
 Zinc selenide is an extremely toxic substance by ingestion and/or inhalation
 of dust, with a cumulative effect. This of course could be brought about if
 the optic were cracked or damaged in one's presence. This material liberates
 highly toxic hydrogen selenide in contact with gastric juices. Because of the
 material's reactivity with acids, it should NEVER be cleaned with even a weak
 acid, as these highly toxic H2Se vapors may be formed. Dermatitis may result
 from prolonged contact - don't play with your output couplers. :-) Although
 this material is practically insoluble in water, the use of gloves while
 handling the material is recommended. Gloves or finger cots should naturally
 be worn when handling any precision optic, as mentioned above.  Particular
 care must be exercised when machining and creating dust or particles, not that
 I would think anyone will be machining their precious output coupler. :-)
 Symptoms of ingestion include garlic odor on breath.  Ye best friend should
 tell thee. :-)
</ul>

Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.

<p>
<li>The "Laser Growing Mailing List" is strictly for people *serious* about
  building their own lasers from scratch, the first being a 50-100 Watt
  flowing gas carbon dioxide (CO2) laser.  During the early months of its
  existence, there was a lot of activity and at least one person did achieve
  "first light".  However, now, as far as I can tell, it is dead, or at least
  in a coma.  There have been no postings in months.  For more info, see the

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc23">Home-Built CO2 Laser Description</A></h3>

The CO2 lasers in "Light and its Uses" and the Iannini book [3] are very
similar.  They can be built without a need for real glass working (though the
Iannini version does call for some) and WILL produce WATTS of beam power at
10.6 um.
<p>
The summary below is for the CO2 laser from "Light and its Uses".  Also see
the section: <A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2icd">Iannini CO2 Laser Description</A>.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="co21asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Carbon Dioxide Laser
Assembly</A> for a simplified diagram of the overall glasswork and power
supply electronics.

<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Overall - L to M.
 <li>Glass work - L or none.
 <li>Fabrication - M.
 <li>Vacuum/gas handling. - L.
 <li>Power supply. - L.
 <li>Additional apparatus (alignment jig, etc.) - L.
 <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - 10,600 nm (10.6 um - far IR).  Output at 9.6 um
 which is also quite strong may be possible (or achieved accidentally).
 However, without fancy equipment, there is probably no easy way to tell!
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Type/lasing medium - Low pressure mixture of CO2, N2, and He.
<p>
 <li>Bore diameter - 25.4 mm (1 inch), bore length - 45.7 cm (18 inches).
<p>
 <li>Total tube length (to mirror surfaces) - Approximately 60 cm.
<p>
 <li>Tube material - Borosilicate glass.
<p>
 <li>Electrodes - Cold cathode type formed by mirror mount/bellows assemblies
  at ends of tube.  Note: The electrical discharge will gradually eat away
  at the negative electrode so it may be desirable to use separate high
  current (200 mA) neon sign electrodes in their own insulated mounts
  separate from the mirror mounts or fused into side-arms of the main
  discharge tube as with the Iannini CO2 Laser.  (See the section:
  <A HREf="lasercc2.htm#cc2icd">Iannini CO2 Laser Description</A>.)
  I do not know how quickly this becomes an issue.
<p>
 <li>Gas fill - Mixture of CO2, N2, and He (1:2:8 appears to be optimal where
  the partial pressure of He is 4 Torr).  Pressure may range from 1 and 20
  Torr.  (A smaller diameter, e.g., 1/2 inch, tube will run at higher
  pressures.)  The laser will work (but not as well) without He using a 1:2
  ratio of CO2:N2.  The CO2 is what actually lases but the other gases
  are needed to efficiently excite the CO2.  See the chapter on CO2 lasers
  for more info.
<p>
  CO2 can be easily obtained from dry ice; N2 from filtered air (despite the
  presence of O2 and other trace gases) apparently works well enough.
<p>
  Unless you have your heart set on experimenting with various gas ratios
  or other gases, the use of commercial CO2 laser mix really is the best
  way to go as it eliminates the hassle and expense of a fancy gas
  mixing/metering manifold and the three separate sources of gases.
  CO2 laser mix is readily available from gas suppliers.  See the section:
  <A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2cc24">Sources of Special Parts and Supplies for
  the Home-Built CO2 Laser</A>.
<p>
  Estimated gas consumption is roughly .1 liter/hour of helium per watt of
  output power.  The amount of the N2 and CO2 then scales with their fill
  ratio.  All of these flow rates are referenced to standard temperature and
  pressure (20 &deg;C, 1 atmosphere).  So, a 50 W CO2 laser will require
  roughly 0.625 liter/hour of CO2, 1.25 l/hr of N2, and 5.0 l/hr of He
  assuming the 1:2:8 gas fill ratios - or about 6.875 l/hr of CO2 laser mix.
  These gas flow rates don't sound like much until you realize that they
  will be almost 200 times greater at 4 Torr but of course the gas usage
  is still that relatively low number! :)
<p>
 <li>Cooling - Aluminum water jacket (12 inches long by 2 inch diameter
  centered on plasma tube) with flowing tap water.  (Glass or Plexiglas
  could have also been used.)
<p>
 <li>Coupling - Integral to tube via metal bellows and 3 screw adjustments.
<p>
 <li>Mirrors - HR: Copper coated, concave, f >= twice the distance between the
  mirrors (about 112 cm); OC: Germanium or hole in glass (2.5 mm, !!) and
  IR-transparent window of NaCl (rock salt!), CaCl, KCl, or BaFl - but note
  that all of these are hygroscopic - water absorbing - so must be stored
  with a desiccant to keep them dry and in an environment of less than
  35 percent relative humidity at all times), planar.  (Germanium is
  preferred but may be expensive.)  Three screw adjustable mirror mounts are
  part of end electrode bellows assembly.  Alignment using HeNe laser or a
  variety of other techniques.
<p>
 <li>Total resonator length (mirror to mirror) - Approximately 56 cm.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Requirements - Low to medium.  A salvaged refrigeration compressor (using
  the suction side) may be good enough as long as it can achieve the vacuum
  needed for operation (going a lot lower isn't as critical with the flowing
  gas design).  See the sections starting with:
  <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concvs5">Salvaged Refrigeration Compressors as
  Vacuum Pumps</A>.  However, a conventional rotary two stage pump would be
  preferred (a single stage 'disto' pump should also work.
<p>
 <li>Flowing - The gas mixture and flow rate can be adjusted to optimize
  performance.  The gas supply tank will need a low pressure regulator
  followed by a metering (needle) valve to the laser tube.  At the other
  end of the tube is another metering valve going to the vacuum pump.
<p>
  The idea isn't to pump CO2 laser mix through the tube fast as
  possible but to maintain a controllable pressure inside the tube with
  a slow flow rate.  The gas doesn't get "used up" that quickly by the
  laser.  Think of the pressure reguator and vacuum pump as an ideal voltage
  sources with the gas pressure regulator, tube, and metering valves as
  resistors.  There should be a constant flow (current) through the tube
  and nearly constant voltage (pressure) across the tube.  Thus, the
  resistance of the tube should be low compared with that of the rest of
  the system.

  115 VAC).

<p>
  The laser can be operated on half-wave rectified DC with about half the
  output power making for a very simple power supply.  It can also be
  operated on the raw output of the neon sign transformer (AC)
  but the efficiency and maximum power output may be lower (though it isn't
  entirely clear why this should be the case since the discharge current is
  varying in the same manner for both cases).  Even a low current oil burner
  ignition transformer (typically 8 to 10 kV at 15 to 20 mA) or smaller
  neon sign transformer will be adequate for testing of shorter tubes.
<p>
  With the addition of some filtering and a ballast resistance
  to a basic rectified DC power supply, the nearly optimal current could
  be maintained continuously boosting efficiency and power output.
  To achieve a stable discharge, a ballast resistor of 100K or more will be
  needed.  Based on its resistance and the tube current, the power disspation
  will likely need to be 100 W or more.  A series/parallel combination of
  lower value lower wattage resistors will be the best option for its
  construction.  A more sophisticated alternative to the huge ballast resistor
  is a regulator but doing this in the HV output would present some significant
  challenges, to say the least. :)  Most modern CO2 laser DC power supplies are
  switchmode high frequency inverters using pulse width modulation to implement
  the regulation circuitry.
<p>
  Once a filtered DC supply is used, a starter like a high power version
  of that used for modern HeNe laser tubes will be required.  See the HeNe
  power supply information in the sections beginning with:
  <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns">Starters - Voltage Multiplier,
  Pulse, Inverter, Piezo</A>.
<p>
  Also, see the sections starting with:
  <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcps0">Power Supply Components</A> for additional
  comments relating to the electrical characteristics of CO2 lasers.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Many variations are possible to this basic design beyond improving the power
supply. These include changes to the resonator diameter and length; the
addition and/or substitution of other gases, ratios, and pressures; and
better optics.  With the relatively non-critical vacuum requirements ease of
mirror alignment, making these sorts of modifications should be fairly
painless.
<p>
However, don't go overboard - at least not on your first attempt.  Keep it
relatively small, simple, and get it to work!  Once you have a functioning CO2
laser, it will be relatively easy to scale it up.  However, as the tube length
is increased, the power supply voltage may need to be boosted as well.  A 15 kV
neon sign transformer may not be able to power a 1 meter discharge tube (around
0.8 meter appears to be the limit) reliably over the pressure range required
for CO2 laser operation.  If you are really interested in higher power lasers,
consider a design using a split discharge tube.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2cc2d">Steve's Notes on Boosting CO2 Laser Power and
Quality Construction</A>.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc24">Sources of Special Parts and Supplies for the Home-Built
 CO2 Laser</A></h3>

Fortunately, there are a variety of sources for the optics (windows and
mirrors) and other components required for the home-built CO2 laser.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Laser tube fabrication - As noted elsewhere, fancy glasswork (though
 probably available by paying for time and materials or being nice to a local
 neon sign shop if you aren't able or willing to do it yourself) can be
 avoided entirely using various O-ring type joints, flanges, as well as Epoxy
 or RTV Silicone for adhesives.  Common copper tubing and soldered fittings
 can be used for vacuum and gas lines as well as for the electrodes, with PVC
 pipe for the water jacket.  In fact, while I haven't tried this, I would even
 venture to suggest that the discharge tube could be constructed from clear
 Plexiglas/Lucite/Acrylic plastic if properly cooled since the vacuum
 requirements are modest (so outgassing from resins and so forth shouldn't be
 a problem).  Thus, there are many options for the tube itself.
<p>
(From: Steve Hardy (hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
<blockquote>
"CO2 lasers operate at low temperature, so even soda glass could be used.  Most
 people opt for borosilicate, since it's quite cheap and has better heat
 resistance (less thermal expansion).  A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation
 shows that the temperature on the inside of a typical axial flow CO2 laser is
 only 20 &deg;C above the cooling water temperature.  Nevertheless, there
 may be hot spots (e.g., at the ends) which may be enough to crack soda glass.
<p>
 Regarding other materials (notably plastic), these could be used but have the
 disadvantage of lower thermal conductivity, lower stiffness, and higher price
 than glass.  Fused quartz, alumina or beryllium oxide could be used, but the
 performance gain would not be worth the enormous expense."
</blockquote>
<p>
 Many people ask about where to get the bellows used to join the mirror mounts
 to the discharge tube.  While, these are available from various industrial
 supply and optics companies, they will be expensive.  However, there are a
 variety of low-tech alternatives including flexible water or natural gas
 line - readily available and low cost at your corner hardware store or home
 center.  To be reasonably flexible, these may have to be longer than a real
 bellows, but then your mirrors will be further away from the bulk of the
 discharge and less likely to suffer from sputtering damage!
<p>
 (From: Michael Andrus (andrus@ccountry.net).)
<p>
<blockquote>
 "For the bellows, I used pieces of flexable metal gas line.  You can get this
 at a hardware store for a few dollars as opossed to $40 each for real bellows.
 This avoids the alignment problems with an O-ring-only design."
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>Optics - A metal coated (e.g., copper or gold) mirror can be used for the
 HR but special materials must be used for the partially reflecting OC since
 most common materials are opaque at the CO2 laser's 10.6 um wavelength.  While
 there are ways around this like using a totally reflecting mirror with a hole
 in the middle covered with an NaCl (salt) or KCl window (which reflects
 roughly 8 percent of 10.6 um light at normal incidence), for best performance,
 the OC is often made from a more exotic material like zinc selenide (ZnSe) due
 to its low absorption at 10.6 um.  ZnSe is also used for Brewster and other
 windows that must be transparent to 10.6 um IR.

 laser optics include <A HREF="http://www.II-VI.com/">II-VI Incorporated</A>

<p>
 For external (e.g., beam steering) mirrors, I've even heard that the platters
 from harddrives work well, at least at low to medium power.  While these are
 usually very slightly textured to minimize stiction, since the CO2 laser
 wavelength is over 10 times longer than visible, this is likely not a serious
 issue and doesn't produce much scatter.  However, this should be confirmed
 for the specific platters being used.

<p>
 The construction of a mirror for a laser is not an easy work.
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Usually, the radius of curvature must be greater than 10 meters - nearly
  planar, but not quite.
<p>
 <li>The best materials for 10.6 um are copper and silver (I have done
  experiments with bronze with good results.  Gold is good as well, but
  very expensive.)
<p>
 <li>These materials easily oxidize.  So, you must deposit a protection layer.
  Without protection, the reflection will never be more than 96%.  You need 99%
  or more.
 </ol>
<p>
 So, commercial mirrors are made of gold with several layers of ZnSe and NaF
 (or BaF) via sputtering, and have a reflectance greater than 99.5%. The
 problem is the cost.
<p>
 I have been able to solve those problems buying the mirrors in Ebay.  Make a
 search with "CO2 LASER".  You could get a surprise.
<p>
<li>Power supply - A neon sign transformer really is the best option for a
 basic power supply.  For a small CO2 laser, an oil burner ignition transformer
 (typically 8 to 10 kV, 10 to 30 mA) might suffice.  Other types of common high
 voltage sources such as the one in your computer monitor or large screen TV
 really don't have the current capability required for a CO2 laser.  So leave
 them alone. :)
<p>
 For operation on DC, a bridge or full wave rectifier can be constructed from
 microwave oven HV diodes (typically 12 to 15 KPRV, .5 A).  Depending on the
 output of your transformer, either 1 or 2 will be required in series for each
 rectifier (1.414 * VRMS minimum PRV).  If you get them from the same lot
 number, equalizing components are probably not needed where 2 are in series.
 Electronics service parts places like MCM Electronics and Dalbani usually
 sell replacement diodes for about $2 each.  If course if you want to
 construct your own, a stack of 1N4007s will be even cheaper.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhvc0">Standard and Custom HV Rectifiers</A> for
 more information.
<p>
 In addition, if you want to drive your tube with filtered DC, smoothing
 capacitors as well as high power ballast resistors will be needed.
 Electronics distributors or electronics surplus outfits are the most likely
 source for these.  Of course, you could get really fancy and add a current
 regulator.  There is some discussion of this in the chapter:
 <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2toc">Carbon Dioxide Lasers</A> and some circuits
 that may be useful as a starting point can be found in the chapter:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdtoc">HeNe Laser Power Supply Design</A>.  However,
 these are for the advanced course. :)
<p>
<li>Cooling - If you want to forgo tap water and use a closed-loop cooling
 system, you will need a heat exchanger of some sort and a circulating pump.
 A high a flow rate is not required but make sure whatever you use doesn't leak
 as high voltage electricity and water don't mix very well!  Surplus places,
 scrap, salvage, and junk yards should provide everything you need.
<p>
 Note that if the coolant comes in contact with the electrodes, it needs to
 be non-conductive.  Distilled water may be acceptable.  Mineral oil is an
 excellent insulator (if kept dry) as well and often used for cooling
 transformers and other electrical equipment but is flammable.  However, it
 isn't perfect:
<p>
 (From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
 Disadvantages of mineral oil: Lower heat capacity than water, a bit harder to
 pump, flammable, softens some polymers, it is conductive when contaminated
 with moisture, may polymerize under the influence of UV from the discharge
 tube, especially if there are any paraffinic fractions in the oil, doesn't
 magically dry up when you kick a can of it over. :-)  I'd certainly use
 transformer oil if I went that route but you still need to keep it dry.
<p>
 For a circulating pump, it's hard to beat a carbonator pump.  Around here, the
 used restaurant equipment places practically give them away.  Coke will put
 fountains in restaurants and then when the restaurant goes out of business,
 they'll either not get the fountain at all or else they'll just get the head
 and leave the rest.  In any event, carbonators are running out the yingyang
 around here.  They usually come complete with a 1 gal stainless steel tank.
<p>
 The little submersible pumps lack the head pressure you need to force a
 meaningful flow through tubing.  These things are typically rated for only 20
 feet of head or so and that is only a few PSI.  The pump will churn and froth
 and look like it's working but it's not.  you really need a positive
 displacement pump. If you can't find a carbonator pump, another option is the
 peristaltic pump.  This is the familiar "roller and rubber tubing" metering
 pump.  These things are cheap enough to be throw-aways.  Indeed,  I've had
 several different vendors in my restaurant for grease cutting enzyme drain
 treatment.  Each vendor installs a peristaltic pump to meter the enzyme.  And
 when they let the reservoir get empty and I fire 'em for not servicing it,
 they never bother to come get the pump.  I have several on the shelf.  What's
 really nice about these pumps is tubing can be had for almost any media.
 Silicone rubber is typically used but if you want to pump something really
 gnarly, any tubing that is reasonably flexible will work.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
 The 25 to 50 W Sharplan lasers use a 22 litre per minute plastic pump made in
 Germany by a company called Eheim (model 1060).  It's got a nonconductive case
 and rotor but is not self priming.  They have a 1 liter reservoir above the
 pump to keep a constant level in the system.  The radiator used is a 6" by 8"
 unit with 3 layers of fins, 1/4" tubing in the core, and a 200 cfm fan.
<p>
<li>Gas Flow - This refers to both pressure regulators and flow meters.
<p>
 (From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
 Check the restaurant supply outfits near you.  Just like the carbonator pumps,
 CO2 regulators regularly get tossed when the old fountain gets yanked.  A
 couple of years ago I walked in one of my favorite used restaurant equipment
 places and found a large box of regulators labeled to go to the brass scrap
 yard.  I bought half a dozen for their scrap value. (No, don't want to sell
 any. :-(  $5 is the maximum I'd pay for one.  Change the CGA nipple and away
 we go.
<p>
 For a fairly cheap ($20 to $35) flow meter, check out either your local
 welding equipment supplier or companies like
 <A HREF="http://www.omega.com/">OMEGA Engineering, Inc.</A>.
<p>
<li>CO2 Laser Mix - The best way to get gas for your CO2 laser is to buy
 it from your local welding/medical supply company in pressurized cylinders
 already filled with the optimal proportions of CO2, N2, and He.  The killer
 is initial expense since you must include the rental or purchase of the
 cylinder and the cost of the required pressure regulators.  All so see the
 section: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concll4">More on Obtaining Gases</A>.
<p>
 The use of premixed gas also doesn't allow you to easily experiment with
 changing gases or the partial pressures of each gas.  The obvious way around
 this is to provide separate tanks for each possible gas and a mixing manifold.
 Needless to say, the costs, complexity, and difficulties in controlling and
 monitoring gas flow can quickly get way out of hand.
<p>
 If you really don't want to invest in official CO2 laser mix or high pressure
 tanks, regulators, gauges, and metering valves, there are alternatives, at
 least to get your laser going initially: CO2 from a chemical reaction (e.g.,
 vinegar and baking soda!), CO2 cartridges, or seltzer makers; nitrogen from
 the air, and helium from party balloon tanks.  Depending on what you end up
 with, gas composition and purity may be somewhat hit or miss, but CO2 lasers
 are fairly forgiving.  As long as you use decent optics that are fairly well
 matched to your laser tube length, there is an excellent chance of getting
 the laser to work, though probably at much less than optical performance:
<p>
 However, some companies may charge a lot for a single tank of CO2 laser mix:
<p>
(From: Curt Graber (cgraber@fwi.com).)

 Sad to say but most of the larger corporate gas supply companies want
 to have a bottle a month relationship min. and if you sound like you
 have never leased/purchased a tank previously they automatically go
 into unobtanium mode and pricing.
<p>
 doing your own mix is a great opportunity to tune your resonator for
 it's tastes in gas mix but will not save you any money at all as you
 need a significantly bigger manifold set-up and precision meters to
 correctly (read repeatably) set-up the mix as the gas is depleted from
 each reservoir at different working pressures and volumes.
<p>
 My suggestion is to find a second hand medical laser supplier and buy
 a full or mostly full tank of pre-mix that was a "removed from
 medically obsolete" flowing gas laser, there are a lot of them out on
 the market! and the bottles typically get thrown gently on the shelf
 to await another lifetime and or lifestyle such as your application.
<p>
 If you don't have any second hand medical equipment suppliers in your area
 scour the internet for a find close to home as you will want to likely also
 see their other wares stripped from similar units.

<p>
 Generating the CO2 chemically could be kind of nasty unless you came up with
 some sort of drying scheme.  Not only may water vapor interfere with lasing,
 the coating on some optics or the base material itself may be damaged by
 excessive moisture.
<p>
 Why not use the CO2 cartridges for pellet guns or seltzer water bottles?  You
 can buy a seltzer water maker at the local kitchen notions store for under
 $10.  It'll puncture a CO2 cartridge and bleed it into a pint metal bottle.
 If you vacuum the bottle beforehand you'll end up with clean CO2 at a
 reasonable pressure.
<p>
 Alternatively, I only pay $10 for a 20 pound tank of liquified CO2 from Coke
 for the fountain in my restaurant.  That's high compared to what I could get
 it for if I owned the tank.  Coke charges no rental and only a $30 deposit.
 If you have a favorite restaurant, perhaps you could get the owner to sell you
 a tank of CO2.  Another possibility is a party shop.  Party shops around here
 sell pony kegs of beer (about 1/3 the size of a regular keg) and loan the
 tapper (with a deposit) that consists of the fittings to the keg, the
 dispensing head and a small CO2 tank (about 3 pounds, I'd guestimate).  Even
 if you have to buy the keg of beer, life could be worse! :-)
<p>
 As for cheap helium, around here, Wal-Mart sells a party kit that contains a
 30 pound Freon cylinder filled with He and some balloons for about $20.  OK,
 so your really don't need the balloons. :) Some of the party stores carry it
 too but they charge more.  Since it's a standard Freon tank, it has a standard
 SAE 1/4" flare refrigeration fitting.  You can attach either a refrigeration
 service hose or simply a 1/4" flared copper tube.  The tank is pressurized to
 about 275 pounds so there's quite a bit of helium in it and the helium is
 pretty pure.  I use those tanks in my neon shop for helium flush gas on my
 pumping manifold.  This is about the cheapest helium one can get, particularly
 when you figure in the lack of a cylinder rental (or purchase).

 A few suggestions:
<p>
 I just gave away 2 medical surplus tanks at 3/4ths full  to a local
 artist for his laser carving experiments as I'm not a CO2 person. I
 paid $50 a tank for one and the other was on the laser I scrapped.
 When my artist friend asked  asked me what the refill cost was, I
 called a medical laser friend and he said, out the door cost with new tank
 and full tank ownership in St. Louis from his local gas supplier was
 $140 and tax. Now what he has is a local more independent gas company
 that buys bulk and blends their own mixes, instead of a big national
 chain.  I'd find such a place, they do exist, go see em in person, not
 on the phone, present a reasonable appearance and if they ask you
 what partial pressures you think you need, be able to answer them. I
 bet you score a tank cheap.
<p>
 Usually laser gas is considered a high purity mix and they need to
 vacuum out the tank, weigh it, specially clean it, then mass
 spectrometer certify it, etc. For a really precise lab laser or sealed
 service, I could see it needing that kind of preparation. But what my buddy
 does is have the local place do the mix on a normal fairly clean tank
 by pressure and percentages. They have no problems and the laser works
 just fine.
<p>
 So I'd either talk to the biomed engineers at your local hospital or
 find a used Sharplan tank from a medical reseller or find  a more
 reasonable gas place.
<p>
 However, if you're mixing your own gases, for a flowing gas laser, normal
 99.999% tank gas is fine.  The people who tank the gas won't certify it
 as 99.999% but that's what it is, and usually better.  A few parts per
 million of impurities won't hurt you.  But, sealed off lasers are a whole
 different matter.
<p>
 Unless you have a monster of a CO2 or are in daily production, the
 unit just sips gas, especially if you add the solenoid that kicks off
 the gas after the regulator when the plasma is off.
<p>
 The local 5 kW CO2 job shop burns one big size S tank every
 four to eight hours. If somebody does laser cutting in town, hit em up
 for a tank at their rate plus a little extra. If you have one near by,
 they probably will help you out once or twice, as the more they buy the
 cheaper it gets! But watch out for demurrage charges, which is when a
 tank sits too long at one place.
<p>
 Setting up a blending station at 1 to 10 Torr
 final pressures is a real pain in the neck, most needle valves, even
 the micrometer ones, are not that good, and I do high vacuum as part
 of my living. Just adjusting the final pressure needle valve on a flow
 gas is a dog. CO2s do lase over a broad pressure range.  You can be
 both too low and too high and still get about 1/2 the rated power, but
 the sweet spot does vary some what with current.
<p>
 I actually got some lasing once using a welding shielding argon/CO2
 mix and blending in nitrogen, but 1.5 watts out of a 60 watt tube was
 kind of disappointing. :-)
<p>
 (From: Tom Miller (tmiller@umaryland.edu).)
<p>
 I picked up one of the He tanks from Wal-Mart today - $15.19 including
 tax.  This tank is the size of the 15 pound freon tanks usually found in
 automotive shops. I think if we used these by adding a small amount of
 co2, only 4 to 5% more pressure, and bleeding air in for the N2/O2, it
 should make for a cheap setup.
<p>
 (From: Sarlock T. Icedragon (sarlock@twcny.rr.com).)
<p>
 I checked a local company out here and they will sell me a 20 pound CO2 tank,
 and the first fill with custom mix is on them (if the tank is bought from
 them of course).  For this they ask a total of $117.
<p>
 (From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
 That sounds like a pretty good price if he's actually selling you a new tank.
 Particularly if it is an aluminum one.  (Luxor is the most popular brand of
 aluminum tank.)
<p>
 Here are some additional comments on CO2 gas mix.
<p>
 A gas filling station cannot legally fill a tank owned by a competitor.  Many
 gas companies will "sell" (actually a one-time charge) you a tank.  The tank
 will have their name on the collar and they take the empty and give you a full
 one each time.  As is obvious, after the first filling, you no longer possess
 the same serial numbered tank as is listed on your "purchase" receipt.  There
 is no problem until you take that tank and try to get it refilled at a
 competitor's station.  When the competitor sees another company's neck ring on
 the tank and the tank serial number does not match the receipt you bring
 along, they typically refuse to fill it.  Or if they do, they will not do a
 tank exchange and instead send your tank off for filling.  That means you have
 to wait for it to be filled.
<p>
 If you actually buy the tank, the neck ring will be blank.  You can stamp your
 name on it if you wish.  Your tank's serial number will match the one on your
 sales receipt.  Your tank will be sent to to the specialty gas supplier of
 your choice, filled and returned.
<p>
 All that is required to get any tank filled is (1) proof of ownership (sales
 receipt does just fine) and (2) current hydro (date is stamped on the
 cylinder).  Since laser gas is a specialty gas, one won't be buying it from
 the local welding supply store so the issue of swapping an empty tank for a
 full one versus sending the customer-owned tank off for filling doesn't arise.
<p>
 You don't need a fancy expensive regulator.  A MIG gas regulator is less than
 $50 at Tractor Supply and other outfits that sell the Century welder and all
 of its private label versions.  A helium balloon filler is even cheaper.  CO2
 laser gas is lo-tech, unlike some other types of lasers that require very pure
 gas.
<p>
 As for shipping, if you have to UPS it, put it in a box, label it as
 compressed gas and ship.  UPS charges a hazardous materials surcharge because
 it is high pressure (and because they can).
<p>
 (From: Steve Hardy hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
 The typical ratio of 1:2:8 of CO2, N2 and He respectively was suggested by
 Linde Gas who supplied my mix.  The precise ratio is 9:18:73, and is expressed
 in terms of partial pressure.  In practice, this is fairly close to the molar
 ratio (since most gases at 1 atm and 20 deg C, are about 1 mole per 22.4
 litres).
<p>
 Please don't worry about precision.  10% deviation either way in any of the
 components is not going to make a noticeable difference - at least not to us
 amateurs.
<p>
 You may hear of different ratios being used in various circumstances -
 usually the amount of He is varied.  For example, a lower ratio of He
 is used in a TEA CO2 laser.  You can even run your laser with 1:1 CO2:N2 and
 no He, with reduced efficiency.

<p>
 I found what might be another source for CO2.  We have a local paintball
 supplies store, and I bought a 12 ounce bottle of CO2 and valve, full, for
 about $40.  12 ounces of CO2 is a LOT of gas, and a refill is only $2.00.  I
 saw the guy fill it from a standard full size siphon tank, so I believe that
 it is reasonably pure.  I'm sure it's not research grade, but I'm hoping it's
 good enough.

<h3><A NAME="cc2guide">Guidelines to Assure a Successful Home-Built CO2
 Laser</A></h3>

These set of guidelines should be followed during construction of your first
home-built CO2 laser.  The factors below will greatly influence the ultimate
output power, beam quality, and whether it produces any coherent light at all!
For the CO2 laser, which is quite forgiving, increasing the length of the tube
modestly (up to a total discharge length of about 3/4 meter) to boost output
power can probably be done with minimal risk as long as the optics and power
supply are modified accordingly.  Once you have a working laser, feel free to
make other modifications - one at a time.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain proper laser resonator mirrors.  While it may be possible to make
 CO2 laser mirrors in your basement as suggested in the SciAm article, this
 really won't result in optimal performance and will complicate your efforts.
 Of course, that would result in a more from-scratch laser if that's what you
 are after.  The HR should have as high a reflectivity as possible at 10.6 um
 and can be either metal or dielectric.  The optimal reflectivity and RoC of
 the OC will depend on the tube design.  For homebuilt CO2 lasers, the OC
 reflectivity will typically be between 75% to 95% with the RoC of both
 mirrors ranging from very long to planar.
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2form">Useful Formulas for CO2 Laser
 Optics</A>.
<p>
 Mirrors salvaged from commercial CO2 lasers will be satisfactory if
 their RoC and reflectivities are compatible with your tube length and they
 are in good condition. (CO2 mirrors are subject to both degradation during
 use due to high photon flux and from moisture/water damage while in storage.)
<p>
<li>Use an HeNe or collimated diode laser to perform the mirror alignment.
 The wide bore CO2 laser is a lot less critical about this than a narrow bore
 HeNe or ion laser so you should be able to do this quickly and painlessly.
 Do the initial alignment once everything is assembled but <i>before</i> 
 actually evacuating the system and filling it will the CO2 gas mixture.
 Then, you'll be all set to lase.
<p>
<li>Use premixed CO2 laser gas - don't complicate matters by trying to
 come up with your own magic formula, at least not initially.
<p>
<li>For an example of assembly, power supplies, alignment, vacuum and gas
 handling, and operation, see:

 generally useful for any home-built flowing gas CO2 laser and may give you
 some ideas as well.  Also his Web site at
 <A HREF="http://www.emissiontechnologies.com/">Emission Technologies</A>.

<h3><A NAME="cc2ccc">Chris Chagaris's CO2 Laser and Comments</A></h3>

The most rewarding part of building a laser from scratch is the money that you
DON'T have to spend. :-)  The only real outlay of cash for such a system is
for the resonant optics. But, with the inexpensive CO2 optics currently offered
by <A HREF="http://www.mi-lasers.com/">Meredith Instruments</A>, even this is
very reasonable.
<p>
This ultimate operating pressure of your CO2 laser depends somewhat on you
final design. Long, small bore plasma tubes will effectively operate at higher
pressures than shorter, fatter tubes.  Long, relatively small bore CO2 laser
tubes will operate at between 25 and 35 torr, at best.
<p>
The high pressure regulators normally attached to compressed gas cylinders
will not offer the control needed to accurately 'feed' a CO2 laser. Needle
valves must be incorporated in the lines after the regulators to adjust each
separate gas flow to the laser head.
<p>
There are much simpler options available rather than using neon sign
electrodes in this type of laser.  Why do some people insist on neon sign
electrodes when they are not really needed in a small slow-flow CO2 gas laser?
If your laser is to be operated on DC then all you really need is a short
length of copper or brass pipe in the plasma tube as a cathode and simply a
small loop of wire as an anode.
<p>
There is a need for a massive electrode (copper pipe or similar) on the
cathode-end of the tube, as electron/ion bombardment will tend to heat this
end. The anode-end only requires a wire loop. I would leave the method of
sealing the wire into the glass tube to those with glass-working skills, as
there would be many ways to accomplish this.
<p>
As an experiment, I ran the CO2 laser using a 10,000 VDC, 30 mA power supply.
Ambient temperature was 77 &deg;F. The cooling water for the plasma tube
started at 76 &deg;F, as I had not kept my chiller plugged in to power over
the past several weeks. After approximately 45 minutes of normal operation the
cathode electrode (the one we're concerned with) was just warm to the touch
(be sure to turn off power for that test!) and measured just a tad over 100
&deg;F according to my 'not very accurate at that low temperature'
temperature sensor.  Don't worry about this if you are using a good-sized
electrode.
<p>
A three electrode configuration does have some merits, but only if you
have a special power supply designed to properly operate this type of
design. You would ideally want the anode in the center of the tube and
cathodes on each end. The cathodes must be large enough to dissipate the
heat created by ion bombardment while the anode can be much smaller, as this
does not heat up and is better suited to be in the center of the tube. This
set-up would not be practical using a neon sign transformer, as the
secondary high voltage windings are center tapped to case ground. More
importantly, is that you would not gain anything using a single NST. You
would merely be putting half of the output voltage on each half of the
plasma tube. Water jacket construction also becomes much more difficult when
dealing with a center electrode type configuration.
<p>
The easiest and least expensive method for attaching the electrodes to the
CO2 plasma tube, which will require no glasswork, is to use the copper pipe
fittings at both ends. This will also allow those who wish to operate on AC
a simple solution. The common copper pipe fittings that are available at
your corner hardware store will work well in this application. With a little
modification these will also provide ports for vacuum and laser gas. If you
attach alligator clips to your power supply output  wires, these can be
attached anywhere on the copper fittings for simplicity.
<p>
My copper fittings are attached to the plasma tube using an O-ring seal and a
simple clamping method built from Plexiglas plates and machine screws. Two-part
Epoxy is employed to attach the first Plexiglas plate to the outside end of the
plasma tube and to attach the end of the copper fitting to the second
Plexiglas plate.  All the screws are placed 120 degrees apart.  Mirrors are
Epoxied onto the mirror adjustment plates and a thick O-ring will provide both
a vacuum seal and enough play for mirror adjustment (no bellows required).
This is a very simple and inexpensive method which works well and should allow
anyone with a reasonable amount of mechanical skills to build a functioning
CO2 laser without the need for exotic or expensive equipment.
<p>
I use a standard CO2 laser gas mix of 4.5% CO2, 13.5% N2, and 82% He.  This is
commonly available from commercial suppliers like
<A HREF="http://www.airgas.com/">Airgas, Inc</A> which is where I obtained
mine.  These companies can usually provide whatever mix ratios you specify.
Other mixtures that I have seen that will reportedly work well are: 8:8:84,
4:28:68, and 15:25:60 (CO2:N2:He respectively). I would guess that
experimentation with varying ratios would lead you to the best mix to use in
your particular laser.

<h4><A NAME="cc2cc25">Update on Chris Chagaris's CO2 Laser and Optimizing
  Settings</A></h4>

(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).) 
<p>
My original CO2 laser and power supply is pretty much along the lines as the
Scientific American as described in the section:
<A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2cc23">Home-Built CO2 Laser Description</A>
<p>
I have recently built a smaller and more compact power supply for it.  This
consists of a 9,000 volt, 30 mA neon sign transformer, manufactured by the
Canadian firm of Allanson, as the basic unit. This is the type of transformer
with the two high voltage terminals coming directly out the top of the tar
insulation, all enclosed in a somewhat larger metal case.  This case left
plenty of room for a bridge rectifier, key switch, fuse, 'on' light,
milliammeter and a 3 amp Variac. A six foot 3-wire appliance cord with IEC
input module and two 20 inch high voltage output leads, with color-coded
alligator clips complete the package.
<p>
This power supply seems to perform as well as the 15,000 volt @ 60 mA unit
that I had employed in the past with this modest sized laser. I no longer have
a supply of commercial CO2 laser gas and have been using the 'three separate
gas' system for some time now with good success. I have been using a
commercial cylinder of compressed helium (useful for most other lasers also),
nitrogen from the air (bubbled through water) and sublimating dry ice for the
CO2 supply. I had bought a small supply of dry ice on Friday which lasted only
until Saturday evening, due to its tendency to mysteriously disappear even
when stored in an insulated cooler. Out of sheer curiosity today I decided to
try a much more readily available source of carbon dioxide gas to operate this
laser with. Searching through the cupboards I found some white vinegar and a
small box of baking soda. Lo and behold, a small amount of this mixture in a
flask produced a fine source of CO2. I was pleasantly surprised to open the
needle valve from this flask to the laser and see a fine burn pattern appear
on my thermal FAX paper target. No more dry ice! I just thought you may wish
to pass this on to the amateur laser community.  This really simplifies the
gas problem for small CO2 lasers.
<p>
All small CO2 lasers such as this operate under similar conditions. The gas
mix is pretty much standard for most slow-flow CO2 lasers and is usually 4.5%
CO2: 13.5% N2: 82% He. This should be available pre-mixed from any large
industrial gas supplier. As far as optimum operating pressue, this should be
easy to determine experimentally. It will depend somewhat on the plasma tube
dimensions, but will likely be somewhere between 5 and 25 torr. If you have an
adjustable output power supply, you simply start at a the lowest pressure and
lowest current setting that will allow laser output, then slowly increase
pressure as you increase current. You will find that power output of the laser
will increase to a point of saturation. Just below this point, at the highest
output level, is where you want to set your controls
<p>
Being able to see the glow discharge through a clear glass tube has advantages
beside the purely aesthetic value. With some experience operating a CO2 laser,
one can tell much about the operating conditions from the visual appearance of
the glow discharge. The color, intensity, and density of the plasma all give
clues to adjusting parameters such as gas mix, gas pressure and current density
for optimum performance and power output.
<p>
I am not sure of the power output I am getting with this system, but it will
easily ignite the FAX paper in a matter of five to ten seconds without any
focusing optics. The burn pattern is quite large also with this wide bore (1
inch) plasma tube. I have read about your plan for measuring CO2 output power
by heating a measured quantity of water for ten minutes. I have yet to try
this yet, basically for lack of a suitable reflector to steer this beam into a
container. I have a simple thermometer with a flat black penny attached to the
stem to see temperature rise from the beam impinging upon said target. This
allows some comparison of output power, but is there anyway to translate this
to watts? I am getting about a one and one half &deg;C rise in temperature per
second at full power.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, by knowing the mass of the penny (about 5 grams I think) and the rate of
initial rise in temperature, you should be able to calculate the approximate
beam power.  What you need is temperature rise/joule (or calorie) of energy
for a standard penny. :-)  I say 'initial' since losses due to convection and
radiation of the heat energy will be small.  This is still going to be tricky
without a serious effort to insulate the 'sensor'.

(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
Here are some notes on the construction and power output of my home-built CO2
laser:
<p>
<b>Plasma tube:</b>
<p>
I do not recommend having a plasma tube of 1,000 mm (or more) in length, there
my be problems with sustaining the discharge. 15/30 NST will not be enough in
striking a tube of this size - even a 15/60 may have some troubles.
<p>
I have cut my tube length from 1,000 mm to 800 mm.
<p>
For my tube, I chose a bore size of 20 mm ID and 24 mm OD. The larger bore
will generate more power.

</PRE>
My laser tube has an integral cooling jacket, and at both ends of the plasma
tube are 20 mm long extensions of the main plasma tube.  These extensions then
go into two copper pipe fittings (one at each end.  The solid fittings then
are soldered to a set of copper bellows, then another pipe fitting is soldered
to the other side of the bellow.
<p>
One end of the bellow assembly is connected to the plasma tube, and the other
is soldered to a small brass plate. The brass plate then is screwed into a
Plexiglas plate that forms part of the adjustment plate.  Behind the
adjustment plate (the plates closest to the center), are a set of fixed
Plexiglas plates, these actually DO NOT support the plasma tube in anyway. In
this plate, will be fastened a set of three fine threaded rods positioned in
the typical 'L' configuration. The front adjustment plates are then spring
loaded onto this plate - which enables the adjustment.
<p>
In the front adjustment plate, the front has been worked so that the optics
sit in an 'O-Ring' groove, then a clamping plate is positioned over the optic
to hold it in place - vac tight seal, and the ability to remove the optic and
not mess up the alignment of the laser.
<p>
There are no requirements for specialized ceramic insulators required.  And,
best of all, the optics and their adjustments are isolated from the high
voltage.  But all caution must still be taken into account when working on the
lase.
<p>
<b>Estimated power output:</b>
<p>
Although it is very difficult to determine due to the many variables involved,
from my design using 1" optics, 20 mm bore, 800 mm length, and a power supply
of 15 kV at 60 mA, I am guestimating an output from 20 watts up to 60 watts -
but this is only a guestimate going on commercial lasers of similar size.
<p>
Providing more voltage/current will give you higher output, until you reach a
saturation point where the output will begin to decrease with further input
(the same as a HeNe laser).

<h3><A NAME="cc2shcl">Steve Hardy's CO2 Laser and Comments</A></h3>

This is a description of the CO2 laser built by: Steve Hardy
(hardy@keeper.stortek.com) with a variety of comments (and some clarifications
for the U.S. audience) from: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
My laser was slightly unusual in that a filtered DC supply was used.  This
means I had the luxury of earthing the cathode and.  If you use a neon sign
transformer, you won't be able to do this - so please make allowances!
<p>
<b>Tube Size:</b>
<p>
I recommend the use of a smaller diameter tube.  You can run them at higher
pressure and higher current, since the smaller diameter provides better cooling
of the gas.  I used 15 mm ID tube, but only because of ignorance when
building it.  Nevertheless, I was very pleased with the results (about
30 W out for 600 W in).
<p>
<b>Electrodes:</b>
<p>
The electrodes do not get overly hot in operation.  Most power is dissipated
in the gas, which is largely conducted to the tube.  The anode stays cool by
normal convection.  The cathode is subject to ion bombardment but this is not
as bad as some people suppose, because the gas pressure is high enough that
the mean free path is so short that ions don't have much chance to accelerate.
Solder most definitely will not melt.
<p>
Aluminum is a good choice for electrodes.  It naturally acquires an oxide
film, which reduces the danger of sputtering.  I examined my electrodes after
operation and found them to be covered with an iridescent oxide film.
<p>
<b>Vacuum stuff:</b>
<p>
Laser gas is typically 1:2:8 ratio of CO2, N2 and He respectively.  I have
been assured by the experts at Linde that this is the only mixture you need
to use for low flow lasers.  This gas comes in steel cylinders, and has the
trade name of 'lazpure' (at least for Linde in Australia).
<p>
The gas is compressed in a cylinder at many times atmospheric pressure.  This
has to be brought down to 25 Torr.  You will need a regulator on the bottle.  I
happened to have an Oxy regulator which is just fine.  The output of the
regulator is adjustable between 1 and 4 atm.  This is fed into the metering
valve, which is basically an adjustable small orifice.  I used a Porter
metering valve (series 20) which costs under $100.
<p>
Metering valves don't necessarily cut off completely, so you need to be
careful to shut the bottle off (using its valve) after use, to avoid damaging
the tube or vacuum pump with overpressure.
<p>
The gas (quite cold due to its expansion from high pressure to a relative
vacuum) flows rapidly down the tube to the anode end, where it is exhausted by
the vacuum pump.  Before exiting the tube, I have a slight restriction to slow
the flow otherwise too much gas would be wasted.  It would be handy to make
this adjustable too (so you could control the pressure as well as the flow
rate).  If so, then make sure its gas conductivity is much, say 100 times,
higher than the metering valve at the other end, because it is used at much
lower pressure differential.  One possibility which I haven't tried is to use
a ball valve (normally used for water).  Note that any parts which the
operator needs to touch must be positively and securely earthed.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
There is a device available called the back-pressure regulator that makes
regulating the pressure and flow much easier.  A related device, the vacuum
regulator will do the same job in this application.  The back-pressure
regulator works just the opposite of conventional regulators.  It opens its
port whatever amount is necessary to bleed off pressure in excess of the
set-point pressure.  With a back-pressure regulator between the vacuum pump
and the tube, the tube pressure is with the regulator and only the flow rate
is controlled by the inlet needle valve. This little valve will pay for itself
in saved gas because with needle valves on both ports, one tends to juggle
them until a stable pressure in the tube is achieved and then just live with
the flow rate even if it is much too high.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
Sounds nifty.  I presume the back-pressure regulator regulates the pressure
differential across its inlet and outlet ports.  Is there a type of regulator
which can regulate to an absolute (but subatmospheric) pressure?
<p>
The reason I ask is that it would be nice to be able to set the tube pressure
in absolute terms without worrying about the effect of the vacuum pump (since
its inlet pressure would vary slightly with the flow rate).
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
Two types are available.  One type is referenced to atmosphere.  The other has
a vacuum capsule and is referenced to a vacuum and thus absolute pressure.
Wallace & Tiernan (sp?) makes an absolute regulator but it is $$$$ new.  I've
seen 'em at C&H but not often.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
Note that with twin 'needle valves' I never had any trouble getting a
<i>stable</i> pressure, but as you say it was hard to adjust flow rate and
pressure independently.  A regulator such as you mentioned would make life
much easier.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
Yep.  An alternative is the mass flow controller.  A self-contained
mass flowmeter and valve.  Widely used in the semiconductor and thin
film industries and so are fairly common on the surplus market.
That way you set the flow with the controller and then set the
pressure with the outlet valve.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
One problem would be actually measuring the flow rate.  I thought of putting
a balloon over the pump outlet, and measuring the increase in volume using
Archimedes' principle etc.  This would allow derivation of the flow rate in
the tube by multiplying by the pressure ratio (atmospheric/tube).  Or,
just for fun, use a 'calibrated condom' and measure time-to-burst!
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
:-) The common amateur scientist method is the soap bubble technique.  This
requires only a sidearm burette.  A squeeze bulb is fitted to the burette and
the gas flow is introduced to the side arm.  Fill the bulb with a soapy water
solution.  When you're ready to measure the flow, simply squeeze the bulb
until the water covers the side arm.  A bubble will form in the burette.
Simply time how long it takes to travel a set number of graduations.  Assuming
the graduations are in cubic centimeters, dividing the number of graduations
transversed by the elapsed time in seconds gives the actual volumetric flow in
cc/sec.  This works best when the burette is vented to air.  Assuming your
vacuum system is fairly tight, you can flow the exhaust of your vacuum pump.
This is especially practical if you're using a hermetic refrigeration
compressor for the vacuum pump.  Remember that the flow must be corrected to 
he tube pressure using the gas laws to get the flow through the tube.
<p>
A hot wire mass flowmeter is also very easy to make.  Certain GM cars used a
hot wire mass flow meter to measure intake air.  If you find one of these in
the junk yard, you'll see a small venturi containing a couple of hot wire
filaments inside the flow path.  Simply removing the integrated electronics
from the housing and mounting the hot wires in a smaller tube is all that is
necessary to make a very sensitive flowmeter.  The integrated electronics
output a pulse train whose frequency is proportional to flow.  A computer
interface is thus obvious.  A cheap industrial pulse totalizer/rate meter can
directly display the flow.  The electronics require either 5 volts or raw 12
volts, depending on the model.  Note that like all thermal instruments, the
output is dependent not only on the flow but also on the conductivity of the
gas so the instrument must be calibrated to the gas mix in use.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
The vacuum pump (and flow restrictor, if used) is connected to one end of a
long tube.  This tube must be longer than the discharge tube length to prevent
arcing between the anode and the vacuum pump.  The gas pressure in the
connecting tube may be considerably lower than the discharge tube pressure,
which tempts electricity to flow along it.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
Let me amplify on that a bit.  If one plots voltage drop versus pressure, one
finds that the minimum voltage drop, and therefore the longest possible
discharge for a given voltage occurs at about 1.25 Torr.  Below that it rises
sharply until about 1 micron which is essentially a vacuum insulator.  Above
that point the voltage drop also rises but with a much more gradual slope.
<p>
To put this in perspective, a 15 kV transformer will run in excess of 100 feet
of 25 mm tubing pumped to 5 Torr.  The implication of this is that it is
difficult to keep the discharge from following the vacuum line if the line is
at a low pressure<.  The solution is to put the discharge regulating valve
near the vacuum pump so that the line from the laser is at the tube pressure.
Then making the vacuum line smaller and longer than the laser tube will do the
trick.  Note that SMALLER tubing has MORE voltage drop.  Since we're far from
the molecular flow region, simple small tubing can be used.  This is counter
to intuition and conventional wisdom for vacuum systems where larger hoses are
almost always desirable.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
This is interesting.  However, I wonder (publicly) whether it is voltage drop
which is the problem.  I would have though that breakdown voltage is the key
statistic.
<p>
As everyone knows, it takes a significant 'overvoltage' to start a gas
discharge.  Once the gas discharge starts, then the voltage decreases
significantly depending on the available current (higher current may
cause lower voltage drop; -ve resistance region).
<p>
This is why I wonder how you can talk about discharge lengths without
specifying the available current.
<p>
Without actually trying this, I would have thought that a narrower tube would
have a higher current density, and hence <i>lower</i> voltage drop.  However, I
will defer to your undoubted experience here.
<p>
The point I would like to make, is that we are trying to prevent dielectric
breakdown in the gas column in the first place (not worrying about how it
performs after it's been "lit") - this will be independent of the tube
diameter.
<p>
It is also good practice to surround the vacuum tube with flexible PVC tubing.
This is because some rubber tubes are slightly conductive (e.g. for
anti-static properties) and often have a poor dielectric strength.  I found
this out to my cost when an arc punched a hole in my expensive vacuum line.
<p>
Now I use vacuum hose from the auto spare parts shop.  The good stuff to get
is used in trucks (part of their brake system or something).  It's quite
stiff, but seems to have better dielectric properties than 'proper' vacuum
tube.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
This looks to be a place where cheaper is better.  The (relatively speaking)
cheap red gum rubber vacuum hose is completely non-conductive.  
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
<b>Measuring pressure:</b>
<p>
For measuring pressure, I made a closed end mercury manometer.  Normally,
filling the tube can be a real pain, but I found that a syringe is good for
sucking up mercury.  The mercury can be squirted into the manometer tube via
some plastic tubing slipped over the syringe needle.  I used insulator
stripped off wire, however a recent visit to the hospital procured some tubing
of the type which is used for epidurals.  You can even get the filter section
(which I needed, since my mercury had been much loved and was rather dirty).
Actually, you can get some pretty neat stuff at a surgical supplier -
scalpels, latex gloves, those nifty glass-in-glass syringes to name a few.
<p>
I have always had trouble manipulating Pyrex since I only have a bunsen
burner.  The bunsen can (just) manage to heat tubing so you can bend it.
Anything more sophisticated is beyond its power.  Thus the traditional
technique of melting the end of the manometer closed was not available to me.
Instead, I sealed it off with a plastic (acrylic) plug and epoxy.  The other
end connects to copper capillary.  Mercury amalgamates with copper, but I think
it will take a long time for the mercury vapour to create a problem.  The
advantage of the copper capillary is that it can be bent or crimped to create a
restriction to air movement.  You will appreciate this if your vacuum is
suddenly lost - the mercury won't bash out the closed end of the manometer.
Since mercury is nasty stuff, enclose the whole manometer in a mercury-proof
container.
<p>
The first manometer I tried making used silicone diffusion pump oil, however
this seems to have quite a strong surface tension against glass (the meniscus
is concave as opposed to the convex mercury meniscus) to the point that it
would refuse to separate from the end of the manometer.  The oil seems to
absorb gas and water, which requires that it be de-gassed by heating in vacuo.
<p>
(From: John.)
<p>
You might want to take a look at the DC-704 silicone fluid.  It is much
thinner than the DC-705 that many people use.  It still sticks to the top of
the manometer but a short blast with a heat gun or hand torch solves that
problem.  I like the expanded scale that the fluid (specific gravity about
that of water) gives over mercury.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
<b>Cooling:</b>
<p>
I didn't want my laser to be tethered to the nearest cold water tap, so I
decided to construct a recirculating coolant system.  I found an excellent
pump in the form of a bilge pump (used by boating enthusiasts).  These run off
12 VDC and generate enough pressure head (centrifugally) to raise water from
floor to table height.  The cost is about $30.  The 'tank' is a photography
developing tray (11" x 14"), open to the air.  The surface area is high enough
to dissipate the waste heat.
<p>
Since I was paranoid about water leaking over the high voltage stuff, I
overengineered the water jacket.  It was made of aluminum tubing machined and
then shrunk fit into end caps.  The end caps included O-ring seals for the
Pyrex tube to slip through.  The cathode end was directly connected to the
water jacket (and this is earthed for safety), so that maximum cooling would
be available for the cathode (which tends to be the hot end).  The anode was
insulated from the water jacket assembly by 3 mm sheet acrylic, caulked in
with silicone sealant.  The laser assembly was actually supported by the water
jacket, which is quite aesthetically pleasing (in my opinion).
<p>
Water circulates through the jacket, pumped by the bilge pump.  I got fairly
good at making hose barbs, since there is quite a lot of tubing by the time
the whole thing is completed.
<p>
I used acrylic all over the place at the anode end.  With the water cooling,
there is very little heat.
<p>
Before you fly into a panic regarding heat dissipation, just remember that
the dissipation per unit surface area of the tube is not all that high.
My tube's waste heat is about 1 W per square cm.  Just make sure there are
no large areas (say over a few cm^2) which are covered by thermal insulators
like plastic, otherwise a hot-spot will develop.
<p>
Don't put anything between the tube and the water since the thermal
conductivity will be impaired.  2 mm thick glass will easily take 30 or 40 kV
so don't worry about dielectric breakdown.
<p>
Don't worry about a short (say 3cm) section of uncooled tube at either
end.  Just let the air flow around it.
<p>
The purpose of the water jacket is not so much to get rid of vast quantities
of heat; rather it is to keep the tube (and hence gas) temp as low as possible.
(Sometimes I wonder if dry-ice/acetone would be an ideal coolant...)
<p>
<b>Power supply:</b>
<p>
You can never have too much power.  If you have a choice of transformers,
get the larger one!  Throttle it back with a Variac.  For twice the electrical
power input, you will not necessarily double the output.  It depends on so many
factors.  For the same setup, you may actually get more than double the output
because the higher current may mean that you can increase the gas pressure,
the tube gain, and hence the output coupler efficiency.  Then again, you might
get less than double the output if your setup is operating optimally at the
30 mA level.
<p>
My power supply is a 600 W microwave oven transformer, multiplied up to about
12kV.  I found that at very low gas flow, the thing had about the power of a
dead match (just enough power to smoulder a small spot on my much abused pine
block).  Opening the needle valve and simultaneously increasing the variac (to
maintain about 70 mA) really boosted the power output (to the point of punching
holes in the pine block).  Unfortunately, further increases in gas pressure
(and flow rate) caused the arc to go out since the power supply couldn't push
the required current.  A 15 kV/60 mA NST (900 W) should be good enough for
pushing the performance envelope.
<p>
<b>Measuring power output:</b>
<p>
Everyone wants high power.  It's very frustrating if you have no means of
measuring the power output.  I used the principle of measuring the equilibrium
temperature of an object which absorbs the output beam.  This is compared with
the temperature obtained by the same object heated by a known resistance, when
not illuminated.  Although very slow to take a measurement, it is at least
accurate enough to calibrate a faster instrument such as a pyroelectric or
thermocouple detector.  The 'object' is a finned aluminum block with a
15 degree conical hole.  The hole is blackened by overheating olive oil in it.
A 20 W wire-wound resistor is clamped to it (for the reference power source).

<h4><A NAME="cc2shbl">Steve Hardy's Plans for His BIG CO2 Laser</A></h4>

(From: Steve Hardy (hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
My new CO2 laser should produce about 500 W if I manage to solve a few
problems.
<p>
I'm planning to use a folded tube.  Currently, 6 tubes of about 600mm
discharge length giving a total of 3.6m.  These will fit into a 75mm diam
cooling jacket.  Both OC and TR will be at one end (the grounded end).  The
other end will be a fixed cube-corner arrangement, which means that only 3
flats will be required for a total of 6 reflections, and adjustment will not
be required.  Back at the OC end, 4 additional flats will be required for the
beam folding.  Pairs of these flats are combined into pre-adjusted cube-edge
units, to minimize the required number of adjustments.
<p>
Although it is a lot of trouble to build a folded assembly, the shorter
overall length (1m instead of 4m) will make the unit much more stable and
useful.  In addition, the increased cross-section and reduced length will
allow the gas flow to be increased.  Also, it's much easier to make a
relatively low voltage supply (11 or 12 kV) to run the reduced length.  Imagine
the alternative of 40 or 50 kV for a 4 meter tube!
<p>
All this depends on the power supply, which is a major part of the whole
project.  I originally conceived this power supply as a versatile experimental
aid.  It operates from 240 VAC at 10 A or 415 VAC at 10A three-phase.  The
output is adjustable between 1 and 31 kHz (in 1 kHz steps), and the duty cycle
adjustable between 0/256 and 255/256.  The primary winding of the output
transformer (a big ferrite core) is fixed at 50 turns, and the secondary is
replaceable.  I can put a single turn secondary for 12 V at 500 A (e.g.
for welding) or 1,000 turns for 12 kV at 0.5 A (for CO2 lasers).  The
advantage of high frequency AC is that one can use much smaller capacitors and
inductors.  I am still in the process of designing this transformer, since the
current version has too much leakage inductance.
<p>
Everything will be microprocessor controlled, so I can program things like
pulse timings, feedback control, and so on.
<p>
I'm seriously toying with the idea of designing a more modest SMPS (perhaps
1 kW max output) specifically for laser experimenters.  This would have the
option of control via a standard parallel port.  If I get this designed and
working (hopefully in about 6 months), I might set up a kit for people
interested in building it.
<p>
For the USA, would it be OK to design on the basis of 220 VAC being available,
or is that inconvenient?  It would complicate the design to be able to handle
both 115 VAC and 230 VAC operation.  Just dealing with 220/260VAC is much
easier.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, single-phase 220 VAC (typically closer to 230 VAC) is usually available
but would require running a separate outlet in most cases - no big deal.  In
the USA, 230 VAC is used for electric ranges/ovens, clothes dryers, larger air
conditioners, and so forth.
<p>
However, it is a simple matter to operate on either 115 VAC or 230 VAC with a
constant 300 to 320 VDC on the main filter capacitors - many SMPSs including
large ones do this with a single jumper that converts between a bridge and a
voltage doubler:

                               +------------+-----o DC (-)

</PRE>
<ul>
<li>With the jumper, J1, installed, the circuit is a voltage doubler for use on
  115 VAC.  (D3 and D4 never actually conduct because they are always reverse
  biased.)
<p>
<li>With the jumper, J1, removed, the circuit is a simple bridge rectifier for
  use on 230 VAC.
</ul>

(From: Steve.)
<p>
OK.  I'll try to design with the option of filter caps.  Without the caps,
the voltage doubler trick isn't available so the driver will have to natively
work with either voltage (115 or 230 VAC).
<p>
I'm expecting the price to be about $400 for the electronic and magnetic
components, but this depends on how many takers there are.  Typically, one has
to order about 75 power semiconductor devices to get a discount.
<p>
I might downgrade the power output to 700 W if it makes a large price
difference.  After all, this is still a lot more power than your typical
15 kV/60 mA NSX (about 400 W).
<p>
Regarding DC output, this is an interesting question.  There are basically
three solutions:
<p>
<ol>
<li>True DC with resistive ballast.
<p>
<li>AC with inductive ballast, followed by unfiltered rectifier.
<p>
<li>Unrectified version of (2).  This is not strictly DC, but with an
 appropriate drive it may approach a constant current magnitude that just
 flips in sign.
</ol>
<p>
There are other theoretical solutions, but not practical for such high 
voltages.
<p>
(1) suffers from the disadvantage of power loss in the ballast e.g. my laser
required a minimum of 40k at 70mA i.e. power loss of 196W.  The advantage is
steady current which allows best _tube_ efficiency.
<p>
(2) Is electrically efficient, but tube output may be lower than it would be
if driven by the same RMS DC.
<p>
(3) Would have the same performance as (2), but the cost of the rectifier is
eliminated, and the power dissipated at the cathode is distributed over the
two tube electrodes instead of concentrated on one end.  This is an advantage
as far as heat dissipation goes, but requires appropriate construction.
Another possible advantage of (3) is easier tube starting, since the (HF) AC
is going to ionize the gas by capacitive reactance.
<p>
The $M question is just how much difference in output is there between (1) and
(2)/(3)?  I don't know the answer, but I'm willing to bet that there would not
be much difference if the operating frequency was over a few kHz.  My guess is
that the gas will still exhibit laser gain for a few tens of microsecs after
the current drops to zero, thus at high enough frequencies the tube will
respond more the the RMS current level rather than the instantaneous level.
Please tell me if I'm wrong.  If someone has the time, they should measure the
output of their tube with respect to the 60Hz AC phase i.e. spin a strip of
fax paper (wound around a drum spinning on a synchronous motor) and direct the
beam onto it.  If the fax paper is completely unaffected at one point it means
that the power output drops to near zero at the current- crossing point.
<p>
Anyway, if I design this SMPS it will be a straight HF AC output -- you will
have to make your own arrangements for rectifying and filtering.  To minimize
50/60Hz modulation, the rated output will be obtainable for any input voltage
over, say, 50 V with the duty cycle varying to keep constant output whenever
the input AC is over 50V.  This will provide 'steady' output for 80% of the
time with 115 VAC input (or 91% at 240 VAC).  The power factor won't be real
good, and there's a few technical problems to overcome, so specification
subject to change!

<h3><A NAME="cc2mdc">Mark's CO2 Laser and First Light</A></h3>

(From: Mark Dinsmore (dinsmore@ma.ultranet.com).)
<p>
I'd like to report a successful power-up on my laser.  Some photos of the
laser can be found via the <A HREF=
 "http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Station/2727/">Lasergrowing 1 Web
  Page</A>.
<p>
I lined the mirrors up very carefully with a little laser pointer and as soon
as I turned on the current, it burned a perfect 1/2" round spot on some
paper-covered plexiglass I was using for a target.  I then graduated to
a red brick, and got a nice round red hot spot the same size.  When I
put in the 7.5"FL lens I bought, things got really exciting.  The brick
got white hot when placed near the focal length, and the beam melted the
brick to a diameter of around 0.2".  This is a bit bigger crater than
the 30 Watt CW YAG laser I have at work will do.  I then switched to the
3" FL lens, and started playing with popsicle sticks.  Waving the stick
through the beam at the focal length made a really pleasant buzzing
noise with a white hot spot on the surface, and would burn a line
through half the stick in 100 milliseconds.  I could tell the time
because I could see the 120Hz pulse rate burned into the stick!  If I
moved the stick a little slower, it would slice it right in half.  The
only problem is that there is a strong jet of smoke directed right back
at the lens, and it got it a little smokey.  It cleaned right up with
some lens paper, but I definitely would need some kind of air blast to
protect the lens.
<p>
The laser would operate over a very wide range of gas pressure and
current, so that part of firing up your laser will not be very
critical.  It ran fine from ~5Torr to the point where the plasma blinked
out, with no huge variations in output.  I don't have my peltier power
meter set up yet so I couldn't measure the actual power out, but it was
quite gratifying.  The only disappointment was that the electrodes heat
up more than I expected.  I am using aluminum cylinders 1"dia by 4"
long, and they get hot enough to be uncomfortable to touch after about 5
minutes of operation(Yes, the power was off and the power plug
disconnected!).  If I want to be able to run continuously, I will have
to find a way of heat sinking them or forced air cooling them.  I am
using a very simple mounting system for the optics, just pushing them
against an O-ring with the adjustable optics mount.  There is more
than enough movement allowed by the O-ring to align the cavity.  The
mount is mechanically referenced to a 2" diameter steel pipe, so small
movements of the plasma tube should not affect the mirror
alignment(we'll see).   I designed the adjusters with ceramic standoff
insulators, so the adjustment knobs are at ground(water pipe!!!)
potential.
<p>
The cavity is about 1 meter, with a 5 meter radius total reflector, and
a 80% transmission output coupler.  I am using the gas mix recommended
in the CORD information, i.e.,  1:1.5:9.3 CO2:N:He at about 0.5
liter/min.  I just mixed the gas using partial pressures in a small gas
bottle.  The He and N2 I got at work, ultrapure stuff, but the CO2 I got
from the local paintball shop!  The active length is 80 cm, with a 15 kV,
60 mA NSX powering the system with AC.  I will try to get some pictures
to post sometime in the near future.
<p>
I am intrigued by
<b>U.S. Patent #4,756,000: Discharge Driven Gold Catalyst with Application to
a CO2 Laser</b> where the gold is used to recombine decomposed CO2 in the
laser.  I notice on my 80 cm, 30 mA tube that the last third of the discharge
region is turning whit-ish, a sign of significant contamination according to
the patent.  This happens even at fairly high flow rates (e.g., 4 L/min).  I
can think of several ways to get the gold on the tube, but before I spend any
time on this I would like to know if any practical systems, i.e., commercial,
use catalyst systems like this.
<p>
I've been burning other interesting substances (all in the name of
science, of course!)  I have a piece of alumina insulation, and the
focussed beam generates a brilliant white spot and leaves a glazed trail
on the surface - that's over 2000 &deg;C, according to the books!  I can
burn nice round holes through mica. I still haven't attempted burning metal,
other that a piece of stainless wire that I just got red hot.
<p>
I'm still not satisfied with the stability of my mirror mounts.  I have
to tweak them often to keep the max power up.  I'm trying to analyze
whether that is an intrinsic quality of using O-rings for the compliant
part of the mount, or if it is sloppiness in the adjustable part of the
mount.

<h3><A NAME="cc2bcl">Bill's CO2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Bill Boutsikas (bm-qwists@otenet.gr).)
<p>
In the middle of 1999 I built a small CO2 laser. This construction was
similar to the Robert Iannini laser capable of 20 to 30 W.
<p>
One month ago I built a bigger and revised slow-flow CO2 laser.  Here are
some of the main construction details:

<ul>
<li>The laser utilizes a three electrode configuration with the cathode in the
 center and the anodes on each end of two tubes. Both cathode and anodes are
 made of aluminum not only because of reduced sputtering effect, but also of
 the easiest machining and reduced weight. These are attached to the tubes by
 means of O-rings.
<p>
<li>Each of the 2 tubes is 750 mm long by 15 mm ID and 21 mm OD (very thick
 walls!!). Two separated cooling jackets are used with flowing tap water.
 These jackets are Plexiglas tubes 730 mm long by 50 mm OD with 3 mm thick
 wall attached to the tubes by means of hard resin with O-rings.  This resin
 is special green-colored very hard nonconductive material, that my machinist
 friend donated to me. In this way the system is vacuum and water tight and
 can be disassembled easily for maintenance.
<p>
<li>The water fittings are 10 mm wide and I use tap water for this. I plan to
 use a closed loop system, but I have to solve some problems.  First the
 proper circulating pump. I found a small plastic pump which works at 12 VDC
 with pumping speed of 9 lpm, but it is not self-priming and powerful.  Second
 problem is that of heat exchanger. This must not be air cooled, but it must
 use refrigerants in order to keep the water temperature lower than environment
 temperature (Imagine the continuous use of this laser in the summer at 40C
 with only an air-cooled heat exchanger).  The water temp must be 10 to 15C
 and I hope to find the solution soon (any idea here is welcome).
<p>
<li>The mirror mounts are 3-point adjusted plates, placed with thick (3 mm)
 O-rings at each end of anode block. The optics I used are as follows. HR:
 Silicon with enhanced silver coating, 1" diameter x 0.12" thick with a 10 m
 radius.  OC: Zinc selenide (ZnSe) 1" diameter x 0.12" thick, 70% reflectance.
 Focus Lens: Zinc selenide (ZnSe) 1" diameter x 0.12" thick, 5" FL.
<p>
<li>The above construction is mounted on 2 m long by 120 mm wide by 20 mm
 height extruded aluminum base. The overall system is fairly strong and no
 significant variation of output power is recorded during stress.
<p>
<li>Gas-mixture I use is 9.5% CO2, 13.5% N2, 77% He in a 20 liter tank,
 flowing through a two-stage regulator and simple medical type flow valve to
 feed the system. The gas-feed is at the end electrodes with 1/4" hoses,
 vacuum pump connected to middle with 1/2" hose. The vacuum pump is a 2
 stage 75 lpm unit capable of 10<sup>-3</sup> mbar ultimate vacuum. The
 lowest vacuum that I got it was 40 microns (0.05 mbar) on my digital gauge.
<p>
<li>The power supply consists of a custom wound 15 kV, 120 mA neon sign
 transformer driven from 0 to 250 VAC, 8 A Variac (in Europe we use 220 VAC),
 full wave bridge rectifier made from a stack of 104 1N4007s, two ballast
 resistors (one for each anode), time delay for CDRH compliance and soft-power
 circuit to protect fuses from startup overcurrent. Key switch, 'on' light, DC
 milliammeter, emergency stop button, 2 m HV cables, full labeling complete the
 package and everything appears to work fine except that after a few minutes,
 the temperature on ballasts rises to 230C !!!.  The disadvantage of using a
 single transformer is the requirement of separate ballast resistors to divide
 the current to the anodes, but the problem of overheat is present and is very
 serious!!.  The optimum current for each tube is 35 mA (70 mA total), hence
 the thermal power on each of 60K Ohm resistor is about 74 W. We are talking
 about for a small furnace!!!.  I will replace the 15 kV, 120 mA BIG NST and
 two ballasts with two smaller 12 kV, 60 mA NSTs (1 for each anode and share
 the cathode) and 2nd bridge rectifier in order to avoid the use of ballasts.
<p>
 At this point any help or idea is welcome.  As you can understand, there are
 no filter capacitor in the above PSU. I would appreciate if someone tell me
 where I can find 1 uF, 25 kV or something similar inexpensive oil filled
 capacitor for this function. I have in mind some place to buy such capacitor,
 but the price is prohibitive for me.
</ul>

Where: REG = Regulator, NV = Needle Valve, SV = Shutoff Valve, and
VS = Vacuum Sensor.
<p>
Because I do not have a proper power meter yet, I'm not sure about the power
output I'm getting with this system, but I estimate about 93 W, based on the
CORD LEOT's equations for hemispherical slow-flow cavity.  In the near future
I'll buy a power meter from Macken
Instruments.  This laser is capable of burning holes in ceramics, plastics,
and glass but I have not tried sheet metal yet.
<p>
I plan to automate the gas support system with electronically controlled
solenoid shutoff valves, so when the vacuum falls below of 0.5 Torr the
shut-off valves will open and the gas-mix feed the system with desire
pressure. When pump stops, the valves will close, protecting the cavity from
overpressure.

<h3><A NAME="cc2rcl">Rob's CO2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Robert Conway (rconway1@cfl.rr.com).)
<p>
Details on my CO2 laser can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.emissiontechnologies.com/">Emission Technologies</A>,
Rob's company founded to sell CO2 laser plans, kits, and even a complete
CNC laser cutting system.
<p>
What I wanted to accomplish was to build a CO2 that would be light
weight, extremely stable, and powerful enough to do something with. My intent
is to build a computer cutting table from scratch including the software which
I will write in Borland Delphi 4. This tube puts out over 30 watts (and I have
also built a similar 60 watt version.
<p>
The current design of the laser head itself is very stable and I
am pleased with its performance. You can run it for 0.1 second bursts for
drilling, or leave it on for twelve hours at a time. I figured hey, the
commercial heads are mostly all glass looking like an overgrown HeNe, so why
can't a home built tube use "glass only"as the structural member of the
laser. I just used low expansion Pyrex with a relatively thick wall.
<p>
As for the machinist part, I have been tinkering for 20 years machining
things here and there so I have basically taught myself. This tube was built
in about three evenings of sitting at the lathe. Then a couple more nights
spent re-machining parts to get the bugs worked out with an isolation issue.
The mirror cells are stone cold electrically and this tube is safe to touch,
adjust, or hold while running. This was another design parameter.
<p>
The cost depends on your stock of raw materials for machining, and your
resourcefulness with the other components. The mirrors are the biggest
expense for the tube at $50 for the HR, and $150 for the OC. The large Pyrex
tubing comes in 48" lengths for about $40. The bore tube is neon sign tubing
and can be had locally for $5 per 48" section. Teflon stock is pretty
expensive though at $125 for a 2" by 12" piece of bar stock. I probably have
$325 invested in the tube. The vacuum pump is a SPEEDIVAC manufactured by
Edwards High Vacuum Ltd. in England. They cost about $2,000 new but I lucked
out and got this one surplus in new condition for $300. The manometer is
hand made from a 1 mm ID glass capillary tube and reservoir of  mercury
procured from several mercury switches. The gas flow gauge and needle valve
are surplus and were cheap. Gas bottle - $125 new from welding supply plus
about $30 to fill it with the laser mix. Gas bottle regulator - any inert
gas regulator adjustable from 0 to 20 psi will do and they cost about $120 new.
<p>
In doing the math and assuming the use of a 40 cubic foot Bottle of gas mix (8"
diameter x 18" tall), you should get about 18.9 Hours usage at 1 L/minute flow
rate. The cost to re-fill the bottle is around $25.00.
<p>
The coolant system consists of 1 gallon tank with $18 bait well pump (700 gph)
from Wal-Mart boat section running from a 12 VDC supply, and a copper heater
core from a GM car with 7" diameter muffin fan. Fan was $25 but I don't know
on the heater core as I had it already. I suspect they are $80 - $100 new.
Power supply is a 15 kV @ 60 mA neon transformer - $150 new, with 6 amp
Variac $25 surplus, homemade bridge rectifier from 60 1N2007 diodes - about
$25 worth, and eight 2000 VDC @ 1.0 uF caps in series for filtration of the
output - $32 surplus but could be $400 if bought new (High Voltage Caps are
Expensive). Ballast resistor is (now) ceramic 100K @ 250 Watt - $18 new. A
0 to 60 milliamp gauge at $10 completes the power supply.
<p>
As you can see I have about $1,200 in this one but the costs could be a lot
more if you are not a good scrounger of surplus parts.
<p>
I will keep you informed on the results of the folded resonator design.
Once these are all de-bugged and I get my AutoCAD Drawings updated, I may
offer partial or full kits of the laser head, and possibly a complete roll
around enclosure that holds all of the support equipment in a nice neat
package.
<p>
(Update as of Summer, 2001)
<p>
I am now offering a kit of parts for the 35 W and 60 W laser tube assemblys
as well as completely assembled units.  There is more info at my Web site,
above.

<h3><A NAME="cc2icl">Iwan's Co2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Iwan Marty (iwanmarty@aol.com).)
<p>
My first hands on experience of flowing gas lasers was gained many
years ago, in the biomedical field, a 35 watt flowing gas surgical
laser. This used pink laser mix 1 and had lots of
solenoids and valves.  It was entirely microprocessor controlled.
<p>
We were all amazed by the quantum mechanics of the whole process, the
manual was excellent being almost an instant course on the history,
development, problems and applications of cutting by this invisible light.
Also great emphasis was placed on the various safety hazards that exist
from such a device.
<p>
At first glance, either a relatively cheap glass sealed CO2 laser or
perhaps the latest small industry OEM units could be integrated along
with our computer controlled XY tables with excellent
results. Although the cost of these range from moderate
wallet pain to 2nd mortgage level, it would be difficult to
justify such a sum for casual use.
<p>
Although someone who needs a laser would choose the above path, my
interests mainly lie in the educational and fun value of building a
prototype tube.  This actually works, a laser that
is user serviceable would be handy for some, but this would not
replace conventional tooling for most folks needs.
<p>
This project immediately ran into difficulty during the on paper
design stage. It became clear that the resonator HR and OC would
either be a very expensive custom built design or perhaps a cheaper
stock optic.
<p>
Although I originally wanted a ZnSe OC for ease of HeNe laser
alignment and transmission of IR, partial coating to a specified
reflection was prohibitive. Ge was easily secured so the basic natural
50% reflective OC was one concrete equation.
<p>
The HR is currently a flat 1st surface enhanced aluminium mirror. I
am keen to see if a copper mirror, gold plated, would work as we could
experiment with different RoC values in-house. A true dielectric
10.6 micron HR mirror could then be possibly be custom made with
some confidence?
<p>
The requirement of a reasonably high gain resonator kept the discharge
tube diameter down to 10 mm, 600 mm in length. This proved easy to start
with a 10 kV, 100 mA neon sign transformer and Variac. I gather that this
is the maximum allowable U.K. rating for double insulated neon signs.
<p>
I was keen to keep the plasma discharge within the cooled area of the
resonator and that the resonator should be easily removed / replaced
along with the turned Al electrodes and sub assembly.
<p>
As I already had CO2 and N2 in-house, it was easier for me to
rent a high grade He cylinder and use a rotometer mixing manifold for
my laser mix.  This seems best at B.O.C. laser mix One/laser mix
Two ratios.  Premixed gas would remove any doubts here.
<p>
A two stage rotary pump seems to be easily capable of providing a good
vacuum level.  Fresh laser mix gas flow rates of around 2 to 4 litters
per minute seem OK.  The vacuum pump is therefore required to cope
with this virtual leak and keep within the current 20 mbar vacuum envelope.
<p>
Cooling was provided by a closed circuit water circulation.
<p>
Again options exist for either using a copper turning and focusing
mirror or perhaps more a more desirable specialist 45 degree mirror
and a converging lenses with gas assist. Again in house milling and
turning would probably do the trick for the mounts at least.
<p>
I am very pleased that the laser actually works, as a garden shed
design.  A short video clip is available on the Compucut forum (take
link below), very early days yet.  Here is a photo of
<A HREF="imco2ls1.jpg">Iwan's Home-Built CO2 Laser</A> in action.
<p>
But the infrared output has got me excited enough to continue this
labour of love.
<P>
To ensure that results are repeatable this basic design will be
replicated twice. Luckily I have enjoyed good relations with several
U.K. based specialists, neon sign power supply vendors, optical
technicians and Master glass blowers. It was an important factor that
parts used would be available at the same specification for further
developments.
<p>
I really appreciate the kind help that I have received, especially the
companies that took me under their wing, donating data, sending one
off free end of line samples and in some cases steep discounts on
current production line equipment.
<p>
I am especially indebted to Sam's Laser FAQ and David Knapp's notes.
<p>
As you can see the design has evolved, the glass rod spacers did not
work too well on the 1st attempt.
<p>
Hopefully this type of laser along with my friend's computer controlled
CNC XY table setup will be a great boost for my garden shed!

<p>
The most-often-asked questions about CO2 laser optics are the required 
reflectance of the Output Coupler (OC) mirror and the radius of curvature of
the High Reflector (HR) or resonator mirror.  The following sections should
help you answer those questions.
<p>
Refer to the simplified drawing below while reading this dissertation. :)
<p>
<PRE>

      HR    &lt;----------- Bore Length (Lb) ------------>    OC
   (Curved) ___________________________________________  (Flat)
      |(    ____ _________________________________ ____    || ===> Output Beam
                |                                 |      (R reflectivity)
                 &lt;---- Discharge Length (Ld) ----> 
        &lt;------------- Resonator Length (Lr) ------------->

</PRE>
<p>
<ol>
<b><li>OC reflectance:</b>
<p>
The optimum value for the OC reflectance is given by:
<PRE>
                                       Ld
                            R = 1 - ---------
                                     500 * D
</PRE>
Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>R = OC reflectance (as a fraction between 0 for non-reflective to 1 for 
 totally reflective) mirror.
<li>Ld = Length of the discharge (active medium, NOT the distance between
 mirrors).
<li>D = Diameter of the bore.
</ul>
<p>
For example, my tube is 1,200 mm long with an inside diameter of 15 mm.  The
desired reflectance is thus 0.84 (i.e., 84%).
<p>
In practise, there is a bit of latitude, since this formula is for a 'typical' 
axial flow.  My OC happened to be 75% reflective and works fine.  Given the 
choice, go for slightly lower reflectivity since it allows for 'future 
enhancement' by the radiation-crazed power-addict.
<p>
Note that for longer and/or thinner tubes, the reflectance needs to be lowered 
since there will be higher gain.  It is not obvious that thinner bores lead to 
higher gain, but this is due to the fact that thermal conductivity from plasma 
to tube wall is enhanced with the smaller distances.  It is most important to 
keep the gas at a low temperature.
<p>
Here are some examples (for relatively long tubes but you can recrank the math
for your tube length):
<p>
Assuming the 15 mm ID, the formula above results in R = 75%, 80%, and 85%, for
tube lengths of 1,875 mm, 1,500 mm, and 1,125 mm, respectively.
<p>
However, I would probably recommend a slightly lower R like 75% where 85% falls
out of the calculations because:
<ul>
<li>The difference between 85% and 75% will hardly be noticeable.
<p>
<li>If there is a difference, you can compensate by increasing the gain of the
 medium (higher flow and current than 'normal').
<p> 
<li>It allows use of smaller diameter tube (e.g. 10 or 12 mm) with a
 corresponding increase in efficiency, and a smaller power supply.  People who
 don't  have the full 60 mA NSTs will still get excellent results.
<p>
<li>The 75% OC will allow for upgrades in the future to, say, 100 W.
</ul>
If you are not keen on experimenting, by all means obtain a mirror with
precisely the specified reflectivity.
<p>
<b><li>HR radius of curvature:</b>
<p>
Single mode (TEM00) operation is probably the most desirable, even if not
always as powerful as multimode.  A concave HR with a flat Output Coupler (OC)
will ensure this condition.  Knowing this, the next question is what radius of
curvature should the HR be?  The answer will depend on (or suggest) a
proper bore diameter.
<p>
The output beam is not a featureless cylinder of light.  It is actually most 
concentrated on the axis, fading to obscurity at the bore radius.  When
talking about the beam diameter (actually, let's be consistent and talk about
the radius - half the diameter).  By convention the radius is defined as the
point at which the beam intensity drops to 1/e (1/2.71...) of its axial value.
At twice this  radius, the beam intensity drops to 1/e<sup>4</sup>, at three
times it drops to 1/e<sup>9</sup>, etc.  This is a rapidly decreasing function
so in practice most of the useful power is contained within a radius where the
intensity falls to, say, 1/e<sup>4</sup> (about 1/54).
<p>
Now let's define the 'spot size' which is the radius of the beam where it
falls to 1/e.  There is a spot size at the OC (which is what you're interested
in) as well as a slightly larger spot on the HR (which you aren't interested
in but nevertheless need to know about).  Note that all this is assuming the
bore is much larger than the spot size (i.e., as if the laser was operating in
'free space'.
<p>
At the OC, the spot size is:
<PRE>
                             lambda * Lr * sqrt((RoC-L)/L)
                  w1 = sqrt(-------------------------------)
                                           pi
</PRE>
and at the HR it is:
<PRE>
                             lambda * Lr * sqrt((RoC-L)/L)
                  w2 = sqrt(-------------------------------)
                                   pi * (1 - L/RoC)
</PRE>
Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>lambda = wavelength (10.6 microns for the CO2 laser).
<li>Lr = Length of the resonator (distance between the OC and HR, NOT just
 the active medium).
<li>RoC = radius of curvature of the HR.
</ul>
<p>
This looks a bit frightening, and should be used just to check that your 
resonator is roughly right.  Let's do an example...  My tube (as you now know) 
is 1,200 mm long by 15 mm ID.  The resonator is slightly concave at 10 m
radius.  Plugging everything in we get: w1 = 3.3 mm and w2 = 3.5 mm.
<p>
The practical beam radius (by the 1/e<sup>4</sup> criterion) is thus 2 times
these values (i.e. 6.6 and 7 mm respectively).  This fits nicely into the bore
(15 mm diameter = 7.5 mm radius) so we can assume that not too much of the
beam is occluded by the ID of the bore.
<p>
If the bore is much larger than this, then power is being wasted in ionizing
gas which the beam misses.  If smaller, then the tube gain will be reduced,
and you won't be able to focus the beam so keenly.  Choose a longer radiused
mirror for larger diameter bores.
<p>
A rule of thumb for checking the efficiency is
<PRE>
                                     r<sup>2</sup>
                           Nf = ------------
                                 lambda * Lb
</PRE>
Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Nf = Fresnel number.
<li>r = bore radius (1/2 the ID of the tube).
<li>lambda = laser wavelength.
<li>Lb = length of the bore (usually the same as Ld, the length of the
 discharge).
</ul>
<p>
Nf should be greater than or equal to 1 for low loss, but not too large.  This
tests your tube's radius and length for diffraction loss.
<p>
Up to a point increasing the radius of curvature increases power output
because the available excited gas volume is used more efficiently.  For
example, a 1/e<sup>4</sup> radius of 1 mm in a bore of 15 mm will only be
using 1/225 of the gas volume.  Thus the maximum possible efficiency would be
only 0.3 * 1/225 = 0.13%.
<p>
However, a larger radius also increases the difficulty of mirror alignment
roughly in proportion to the radius.
<p>
Also, if the radius is so large as to increase the 1/e beam diameter to larger
than the actual bore size, then the output beam may break into higher
transverse modes.  I *am* sort of guessing here, since I haven't actually tried
this.
</ol>
<p>
Note that the effects of the differences between Ld, Lb, and Lr are usually
very small and will not make all that much difference for most designs.
This is particularly true for typical CO2 lasers with internal mirrors and
combined electrodes and mirror mounts.

<h3><A NAME="cc2exam">Examples of CO2 Laser Resonator Configurations</A></h3>

(From: Steve Hardy (hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
I have been looking into the CO2 laser power output formula in the
CORD Lasers/Electro-Optics Technology Module 3-9: CO2 Laser
Systems, and comparing it with the formulae I collated some time ago (as
implemented by Tim's CO2 Laser Optics Calculation Page (now dead).
<p>
The calculations of spot diameters agree, but the formulae for optimum O/C
reflectivity don't agree (at least at first sight), with the LEOT formula
suggesting a much lower reflectivity than the 1-L/500D formula.  However,
looking into this discrepancy more closely, it seems that the difference is
nothing to worry about.  Using the LEOT formula, there is a very wide band of
reflectivities that may be used with very little change in output power.  For
example, over the range 20-80% reflectance, the output power for a typical
configuration changed by only a few percent!
<p>
Note that the LEOT formula is for a low-flow axial type, with water cooled
jacket.  Unfortunately, it only gives the maximum output power and says
nothing about the electrical input required.
<p>
I have tabulated some results from this formula, which follow.  The table is
for some typical tube lengths and diameters which we may use.  The table lists
the optimum OC reflectance, the diffraction loss, and the output power.  I
have assumed an HR radius of 10 m, with a reflectance loss of 0.5%.
<p>
By far the most important factor affecting power output is active length.  All
other factors have a relatively trivial effect.  The moral of this story is:
make it long, flow it fast.  In this respect the LEOT formula is rather
uninteresting as a tool for optimisation, since you get about 60 W/m no matter
what.
<p>
Note in particular that the optimum output power is almost independent of HR
radius.  Running the tables against R = 5 m and R = 20 m shows only
insignificant differences, so I have used R = 10 m as a compromise between
diffraction loss and utilisation of active area.
<p>
The column "Ld%" shows the diffraction loss caused by the bore diameter
approaching the HR spot diameter.  This does not directly translate to a loss
of output power, but there is a slight effect.  The advantage of a higher Ld
(up to about 5%) is better efficiency due to higher active area utilisation.
The few percent loss in power is a small price to pay for much better
electrical efficiency.  My guess for working out electrical efficiency is: if
you double the tube diameter, then double the electrical power required.  The
reasoning for this is that doubling the tube diameter will require 4 times the
current (4 times the area), however the current has to be reduced to half of
that since the thermal resistance of the gas column will double.  For a
concrete example, take the 600 mm long tube with diameters of 7 mm and 14 mm.
If the 7 mm tube takes 200 W to run, the 14mm tube will require 400 W.  The
respective efficiencies will then be 28.3/200 = 14% and 36.7/400 = 9%.
<p>
Tube diameters to tabulate are based on a maximum Ld of 15%, then terminated
at the higher diameter end when the power output actually decreases.  Steps
are in whole mm increments.
<p>
The power output is for a flow of a few litre-atmospheres per minute.
(Exactly how much was not specified).  The power could be increased up to
10-fold (to 600W/m) if a high enough flow could be arranged (such that any one
CO2 molecule only spends a few ms in the active area).  Because of this
sensitivity to flow rate, take the following results with a large grain of
salt.
<p>
Here are the tables:

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc26">Determining Home-Built CO2 Laser Output Power</A></h3>

Rather than guessing as I have done for some of the other home-built lasers,
here I suggest a low cost way of testing it!
<p>
Since water is a good absorber of 10.6 um radiation, a simple 'water heating
test' like that used to evaluate the performance of a microwave oven should be
able to determine the actual power in the laser beam to a fair degree of
accuracy.  Since the 10.6 um output of the CO2 laser won't go through most
common materials, provide a way of directing the beam from your CO2 laser
downward - a polished copper plate used a mirror, for example.  Place 100 ml
of water in a small vacuum insulated flask (e.g., Thermos or Dewer) and
measure its temperature.  Run the CO2 laser beam into the water for 10
minutes.  Then, the power in the beam is given by: P(beam) = Temperature rise
in DegC multiplied by .7.  I do not know to what extent the reflectivity of
the water will affect these readings but the experiment is easy enough!
<p>
(From: Steve Hardy hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
I think there is some risk of breaking the Thermos or Dewer with a misdirected
beam.  I would suggest the following design for high power CO2 laser:
<PRE>

             |\
             |  \
             |    \ 
    Beam --->       \  Mirror

             |wwwwwwwwww\
             |____________\
                   T

</PRE>

A prism shaped box is constructed from thin copper sheet.  An aperture to
accept the incoming beam is cut in the vertical side.  Water covers the
bottom of the box.  Although the drawing looks tall and narrow, it is
better to have short and wide.  A 15 degree slope on the 'roof' would
be ideal.  The 'T' represents a thermometer in good contact with the
underside of the box.
<p>
The whole box is surrounded by styrofoam beads to minimise heat loss.
The aperture allows very little radiation to escape back out, so it
is a close approximation of a blackbody.
<p>
Using the heat capacity of the mass of water, plus that of the copper
box, and knowing the time of exposure, then if the temperature rise
is measured then the total energy input can be calculated.  From
this the power input can be derived.
<p>
Also, measure the drop in temperature over several hours after exposure.
This will indicate the heat loss of the calorimeter so that this source
of error may be accounted for.
<p>
At a guess, the biggest source of error is going to be your temperature
measurement.  You should be able to determine the true power output
of your laser within 5% each way.
<p>
(From: Mark Dinsmore (tango@coolmail.net).)
<p>
I had an idea while I was trying to figure out a good way to optimize the
output power of my laser-to-be.  I wanted a power transducer that had high
output level, reasonably fast response, and predictable optical
power-to-electrical signal transfer function.  It occurred to me that maybe a
Peltier cooler operated in reverse, i.e., as a heat-to-electric current
converter, might work quite well.  all you would need to do is to put a low
mass infrared absorber on one side, and cool the other side with a free air or
liquid cooled heat sink.  It would be easy to calibrate; put a power resistor
on the hot side and feed it with various known power levels.  I set up a crude
test of the concept, and got about 70 mA of current at 2 watts input.  It
seemed approximately linear, with ~40 mA at 1 watt and ~130 mA at 4 watts.
This output current level means you do not need fancy thermocouple meters or
sensitive DMMs.  The thermal conductivity of the device is quite high, so the
temperature of the hot side only rose a couple of &deg;C at 4 Watts,
without a heat spreader.  I was not being very careful with the setup, so I
was quite pleased with the results.  The peltier module I used is the one that
you can find almost anywhere in the surplus electronic dealer's catalogs.  I
think it is rated at 12 volts and 4 amps, and cost about $25.

<h3><A NAME="cc2mclb">Measuring CO2 Laser Beam Divergence</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
How you do this will depend on your budget.  I'll assume there isn't much
of one. :)
<p>
If you have enough power to do a "mode burn" on cardboard, thermal paper, or
the traditional Plexiglas, you can use that to visualize the beam diameter at
various locations.  If your power is lower, go to <A
HREF="http://www.macken.com/">Macken Instruments, Inc.</A>.  Buy a plate
coated with the wonderful material that is charged up under a fluorescent
light and then glows when 9 to 10 um light hits it. That way you can see your
beam.
<p>
Measure your beam width at two points, one near, and one far say 10 to 20
meters and find your beam waist then using the equations for beam propagation
found in any good laser textbook and make an approximation.  You can also come
up with an approximation by measuring the diameter in the far field and
dividing by the distance.  For example, 1.5 cm diameter divided by 1,000 cm
distance is 1.5 milliradians full angle. The divergence is very nonlinear
close to the laser assuming a classical cavity, so don't get confused if you
get some odd measurements there.
<p>
This is a heck of a lot cheaper then buying a expensive beam analyzer, and
unless you need very high accuracy on your collimation, the easiest way of
doing things. Wear appropriate safety glasses when doing this, as fried
corneal surfaces and facial burns are not fun.  Most laser beam analyzers for
this wavelength would use a spinning disk or cylinder with a slit and fast
detector pyroelectric detector, or a cooled IR camera or linear array.
<p>
There is another technique if you have a Gaussian beam and consistent
pulse-to-pulse power. This is inserting a knife edge mounted on a micrometer
stage into the beam till the power first drops to 90% of full power, note the
micrometer reading.  Then move the knife edge till you have 10% of full power.
again note the micrometer reading. The difference between the two readings
divided by .65 is equal to the diameter at the 1/e intensity points, which
is what is used by definition. It's actually 86% instead of the 80%
difference I used, but the detector errors are probably +- 5%  anyways
unless your very lucky and well equipped.  By doing this at several
points close to the laser you can then work out a fit to the Gaussian
equation which is published in most better laser texts. If you have a
complex multimode pattern or a unstable resonator I'm out of my familiar
territory and disregard what I've said.

<h3><A NAME="cc2mcls">Measuring CO2 Laser Beam Spot Size</A></h3>

(From: Leonard Migliore (lm@laserk.com).)
<p>
A cheap way to measure the focused spot size of a CO2 laser: Burn a hole in
paper. All other ways use costly instrumentation (Spiricon, ModeMaster, Photon
Beamscan, Prometec).  You have to be able to deliver consistent short pulses
with a couple of mJ of energy to keep from burning big holes in the paper but,
as you decrease the energy and approach the minimum diameter before the hole
becomes conical, you get a reasonable approximation to the beam size as
measured by real instruments.
<p>
If you want to measure the size of the unfocused beam, acrylic does a good
job but the fumes can't help you live longer.

(From: Kristian Tapani Ukkonen (kukkonen@epsilon.hut.fi).)
<p>
I'm considering a project of building a small CO2-laser.  I have a fully
reflective mirror (germanium with gold coating) and output-coupler
(transparent material with gold coating) from a 500 W laser.  These mirrors
are old but usable according to the person who kindly gave them to me from a
company doing laser-cutting.
<p>
(From: A. E. Siegman (siegman@ee.stanford.edu).)
<p>
The output coupler is possibly zinc selenide (expensive); coating probably is
*not* gold, but a gold-colored dielectric coating.
<p>
If mirrors are salt (NaCL) (they'll be quite light in weight) keep 'em dry!
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
When I built my CO2 laser back in college (from the Scientific American
article), we used aluminum-flashed salt crystals.  Worked well.  Gold would
work even better.  One nice thing about gold is that it can be deposited using
wet chemistry - no vacuum ovens or plasmas required.  I have some stuff
available from the ceramic supply store that when heated, leaves a nice gold
film.  Just flow it on and heat it either in an oven or with a heat gun.
<p>
(From: Kristian Tapani Ukkonen (kukkonen@epsilon.hut.fi).)
<p>
I have plans for a CO2-laser (from "Light and its Uses") but several questions
do arise:
<p>
The article does not really comment on the ratio of discharge tube length to
the diameter and how to correlate this to optimal performance and pressure
and ratio of gases. They do mention about 18" long and 1" diameter tube
with 1 to 20 torr and 8 parts He, 2 N2 and 1 CO2 while with narrower tube
higher pressures apply. Their efficiency is rather low (about 1%) while
I've read even 30% can be achieved. Why would this be - does errors with
pressures and tube dimensions cause this?  They do use 12 kV, 0 to 100 mA to
drive the tube with with less than 10 W output.
<p>
(From: A. E. Siegman (siegman@ee.stanford.edu).)
<p>
CO2 is insensitive to tube diameter; gain goes up linearly with length.  1"
diameter is largish; 1 cm more common; 18" length is quite short; 60 cm to
1 m might be more like it.  
<p>
Power output per unit length is almost independent of tube diameter (larger
tube has more gas, but gas gets hotter because of longer diffusion length to
walls, and so you don't get more power).
<p>
Optimum pressure, mixture and discharge conditions probably best determined by
trial and error.  There are probably known recipes for optimum conditions, but
still, trial and error is the easiest way to go.
<p>
(From: Kristian Tapani Ukkonen (kukkonen@epsilon.hut.fi).)
<p>
Sputtering to mirrors. The article has the mirrors directly mounted to the
ends with bellows of brass as means to align them.  I'd guess that the
mirrors get destroyed by sputtering at least at one end??  In order to
prevent this I've thought about using bi-sectional tube with middle
grounded and either +V or -V at both ends. Would this help? What is it that
really is the threat - ionized electrode material? I've planned using
stainless-steel. I'd rather than mount mirrors to direct contact to plasma
do use some windows at ends and mirrors at some distance away - does this
sound reasonable or will I face problems - if not what would be a good
material for the windows and do they have to be at brewster angle - I've
seen some designs of high-gain lasers that do not use angled windows.
<p>
(From: A. E. Siegman (siegman@ee.stanford.edu).)
<p>
Be careful!!!!  Bellows could be hot electrically, and even if you think
bellows are grounded, discharge could jump to mirrors.
<p>
I shouldn't give advice on this, because I really don't know, but I have the
impression the CO2 laser discharge is a fairly 'soft' glow discharge, and
doesn't do a lot of sputtering or damage to mirrors.
<p>
CO2 gain fairly low; if not intracavity mirrors, then Brewster windows
essential.  Large salt flats possible, but fragile; big ZnSe slabs best but
pricey, and angle is very steep.
<p>
(From: Kristian Tapani Ukkonen (kukkonen@epsilon.hut.fi).)
<p>
I do use a 220 VAC, 20 kV, 7 kW externally current-limited transformer for this
project. I can control both voltage and current with Variac and adjustable
inductance -> 0 to 20 kV at 0 to 350 mA
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
That sort of power supply is gross overkill for a small CO2 laser and very
dangerous.  I would recommend using a luminous tube transformer as suggested
in the article - still very dangerous but not quite as instantly deadly.

I've serviced a lot of them, but only built one of them.
So this advice is worth what you have paid for it ;-)
<p>
Larger electrodes will have less cathode fall (good) and more heat
dissipation (good)  at the disadvantage of being hard to initially
process. If your not going to use a Hochuli matrix, then nickel or
Swedish iron (svea metal) is a good choice.  The traditional layout in
a small flowing gas laser is to place the anode and the suction at the
center and a cathode and gas feed  at each end. This drags  junk in
the plasma out to the pump and helps cool the anode.
<p>
Many of the lasers I've serviced that were small bore had either a
layer of gold and nickel catalyst vacuum evaporated in a spot along the
bore, or about halfway between the electrodes they have a catalyst of
nickel and or gold wires to cause some recombination and a noticeable
boost in output.
<p>
As for multiple tubes, the plasma generally likes to jump between
tubes instead of lasing, so you might need more then one PSU. a
traditional way of isolating discharges is long lengths of fine metal
screening allowed to float up to a high potential   in a narrow tube.
this becomes a major drag on the pumping system.  any thing in the
structure of a hollow cathode, i.e., metal fill tube, hollow glass to
metal seal etc has a tendency to become a electron emitter and thus
cause plasma "jumps" in weird places.  often catanode electrodes
(small opposing discharges of a milliamp or two) are needed to kill
jumps.
<p>
The low pressure region of the main vacuum line is another place
discharges like to start and will go down the plastic or rubber line
to the pump. hence having the pump at anode potential which is earth
ground in many systems.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cclo">Cooling CO2 Laser Optics and Comments on
 Germanium</A></h3>

(From Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
Water is an excellent absorber of IR radiation so you can't submerge the
mirror or window in water to cool it (not to mention that some materials
are water soluble!). In fact, in some laser applications (such as
flashlamp-pumped dye lasers) this property of water is used to advantage, as
an IR filter.
<p>
The typical germanium optic itself is not submerged in water. These optics are
held in very conductive metal carriers and the water is circulated through
the carrier, which in turn will cool the optic.
<p>
Germanium optics were commonly used in older, commercial, low-power CO2
lasers, as in fact the cost of germanium optics were lower than the now
common zinc selenide materials. Germanium is a semiconductor material that
has a high internal transmittance for IR radiation, particularly between 3
to 5 and 8 to 12 microns. This material has a high refractive index which
makes it a good material for the construction of lenses. One of the major
drawbacks of germanium, because of this high refractive index, is the high
reflectance losses of the uncoated surfaces. The application of special AR
coatings are essential in practical use to prevent the normal 36% reflection
losses per surface.
<p>
Another drawback of germanium is that with CW applications there is the
possibility of thermal runaway, as the thermal conductivity of germanium is
rather low. Once the germanium optic begins to absorb energy near the beam
the local value of the absorption coefficient will also begin to rise. This
can bring on a continued and uncontrolled temperature rise which will lead
to destruction of the material. This is why water cooling is essential in
CO2 laser applications.
<p>
The third drawback of germanium optical components is their opacity to
visible light, including the 632.8 nm output from a helium-neon laser. This
would become very important when it came time to align your optical cavity
in your CO2 laser. Zinc selenide OC's transmit a large percentage of this
red beam and it makes alignment of your laser using this material MUCH
easier.

<h3><A NAME="cc2bstp">Beam Stop for CO2 Laser</A></h3>

Unlike the beam from a 1 mW HeNe laser, the beam from even a small CO2 laser -
home-built or otherwise - can cause damage to personnel and property.  In fact,
<i>specular reflections</i> of such a beam can be even more hazardous - because
their ultimate destination may be unknown!  Planar surfaces are worst in this
regard but with power in the beam thousands of times higher than that HeNe
laser or diode laser pointer, even momentary reflections from things like
common construction materials and curved optical mounts must be avoided.
<p>
A beam stop (or beam block as it is called below) is an essential piece of
safety equipment for a Class IV CO2 laser and consists of two parts:
<ol>
<li>A material that can absorb the energy of the laser beam (reflecting as
 little as possible) without bursting into flame or deteriorating
 significantly with use.
<p>
<li>An enclosure to contain any of the beam that does reflect from the primary
 absorber.  A hole at one end allows the beam to enter but very little to
 escape.
</ol>

Note that just because something looks black doesn't mean it will fully
absorb light, especially at a wavelength you can't see.  For example, black
anodized aluminum will still reflect about 10% of the incident light - which
could be quite a bit for a CO2 laser!  So, the design of the beam stop must
also minimize the possibility of reflections back out into the work area.
<p>
Here is one suggestion for a beam block suitable for a typical home-built CO2
laser:
<p>
(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
You will require a fully enclosed metal box, paint the inside of the box
with black paint. On one side of the box, drill a hole so that the beam
will pass through.
<p>
The black paint will serve to absorb the IR energy, and the metal will
act as a heatsink. The reason for the hollow box, is so to contain any
stray reflections.
<p>
There are are ways and materials to make a beam block, but the basis of a
block is that is absorbs excess energy. For CO2 lasers, you should avoid
materials that reflect the 10.6 um wavelengths.  For example, copper is a
good reflector for CO2 laser light.
<p>
(From: Author unknown.)
<p>
If you want the absolute minimum backscatter, without spending an arm and a
leg, do what Thorlabs does for their beam blocks - use razor blades!  A stack
of razor blades is a great beam block, because all of the closely spaced facets
of the blade cause any beam falling onto it to bounce back and forth till
it is very effectively absorbed by the otherwise bright shinny surface of the
blade (Note: The reflectivity of the blade is what makes this work.. don't
try spray painting it black, etc., you will just reduce the efficiency).  If
you look hard in some drug stores, you can still find boxes of 100 to 500
razors blades for 'old fashioned' manual razors. I spent $6 for a box of 500,
that made a stack, about 2 or 3 inches tall.  Stack them up, insert 3 long
screws in the three holes through the stack, and presto: a relatively high
power beam block for under $10.  I have hit my block with a 70 or 80 W
YAG laser for minutes at a time, and although it does get warm, it doesn't
get hot to the touch.
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
Get some black anodized aluminum heat sink - the bigger the better (within
reason).  Anything more than a couple watts of laser power would make a small
piece of metal quite hot in short order.  Whatever heat sink you use, also
coat it with high temperature flat black spray paint - the kind of stuff you
would spray on a barbecue grill.  The stuff works great at absorbing near
and far IR.  If you want to make a very good beam block and are worried
about stray light, you can make a razor blade beam block, or buy one from
Thorlabs.  They are quite efficient.  It's nothing more than a stack of old
fashioned razor blades (the kind with a sharp edge on both sides so they
will stack close together).  You stack them up all nice and neat, and bolt them
together to keep them that way.  The side of the stack of blades where you can
see the individual sharp edges becomes your beam block.  Basically any incoming
light is reflected many times off the nearly parallel edges of the sharp edges
of the razor blades, and is quite effectively absorbed by the material.  Such
a beam block would heat up pretty quick, but it would be effective if you were
momentarily doing an alignment, for example, and didn't want to shut the
laser for some reason.

<h3><A NAME="cc2brew">Brewster Windows for CO2 Laser?</A></h3>

The typical home-built CO2 laser normally uses a tube with internal mirrors.
However, there are some commercial CO2 lasers that have Brewster windows and
external mirrors.  Here are some pros and cons:
<p>
Advantages of Brewsters:

<ol>
<li>Output will be a polarized beam. Does this matter for a CO2 laser?
<li>You can do your fiddling without going near the HV. :)
<li>Mirrors can be interchanged more easily.
<li>Additional optics can be introduced into cavity.
</ol>

Disadvantages of Brewsters:

<ol>
<li>Optics can and will get dirty.
<li>Losses in Brewster window material.
<li>Making sure you get the angles correct.
<li>Unavoidable reflections from Brewster windows (4 places) must be treated
 as Class IV beams.
<li>Additional cost of Brewster windows and separate mirror mounts.
</ol>

<p>
(From: Pres Macy (malase@javanet.com).)
<p>
As far as I know there is no Brewster windows aren't used, except to save
costs that you cannot use windows on your tube.  I believe that all industrial
designs incorporate the HR and OC onto their tubes which act as both a vacuum
seal and optical feedback.
<p>
In fact, a few designs use an *uncoated* window (uncoated one side only) as an
OC because uncoated ZnSe has a natural reflectance of about 27% per surface.
<p>
Further, I would guess that a Brewster window for CO2 laser is difficult since
I have not seen any in industry or scientific designs.  The index of
refraction for ZnSe is 2.60 or so and all Brewster material I have seen is
1.49 to 1.56 which results in an angle around 55 degrees.  The Brewster angle
of ZnSe would be about 69 degrees.
<p>
(From: Steve Hardy (hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
I think you are better off using AR windows rather than brewster.  Although
windows are going to have higher loss, the CO2 laser is a high gain device
so a few percent additional loss is not really noticeable.
<p>
Playing around with the LEOT formula (see the section:
<A HREF="lasercc2.htm#cc2exam">Examples of CO2 Laser Resonator
Configurations</A>), addition of 2% cavity loss in a 'typical' configuration
results in 4-12% loss in power output, with higher output loss associated with
larger tube diameters (less gain per unit volume, hence more sensitive to
losses).
<p>
This 2% loss is composed of a total of 8 reflections per round trip through
the tube.  This means that each window face must reflect less than 0.25% of
incident radiation.
<p>
In theory, you should incline the windows by a few degrees so that any
reflections do not interfere with the main beam.
<p>
For example, consider a window with 0.5% reflection at each face, plus 0.5%
absorption.  (These are maximum figures and you will probably get better
performance than this.)  Taking the worst case, the round-trip loss will be 4
x 1.5% = 6%.  Using the LEOT formula for, e.g. a 1 m tube gives the following
results:
<p>
Active length = 1 m, cavity length = 1.2 m,
HR radius of curvature = 10 m, HR loss = 0.5%, Window loss = 6%
HR spot diameter = 7.05964 mm, Output spot diameter = 6.62253 mm.

</ul>
<p>
Pwr is the output power with no window loss, Pwr2 is the power with
the specified window loss, and Delta% is the percentage difference.
At worst, you will lose 25% of your output.  Maximum power is obtained
from a narrower tube (10 mm versus 14 mm).

<h3><A NAME="cc2fgas">Comments on Gas Supply and Setup for Slow-Flow
 CO2 Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
Regarding the CO2 laser gas system and mixture, I will start from the gas
supply.
<p>
For this, you have two choices:
<ol>
<li>Mix your own three gases.
<li>Purchase the pre-mixed laser gas.
</ol>
The gas ratio that is used for slow-flow type CO2 lasers is typically:
4.5:13.5:82 (4.5% CO2, 13.5% N2, and balance of helium).
<p>
If you are going to mix your own, you have a further two choices:
<ol>
<li>Generate your own gas.
<li>Purchase 3 separate gas bottles.
</ol>
If you take the first option, you can generate the gas in the following
order:
<ul>
<li>He - You will need to purchase a bottle of this - 99.99% purity will be
 adequate.  (What about party balloon helium if it is reasonably purs?
 --- Sam.)
<p>
<li>N2 - Bubble air through water.  (I guess the water removes any dust and
 the roughly 18 percent O2 and other gases in the air, and the additional
 water vapor, don't affect performance much or actually improves it! --- Sam.)
<p>
<li>CO2 - Sublime dry ice (dry ice in water), or mix up a quantity of
 vinegar and baking soda (sodium-bicarbonate).
</ul>
You will then need to connect the three containers of gas to a manifold,
with a needle valve one each bottle that you can regulate the pressure
of the gas. You will need a further valve after the manifold to control
the entire gas supply. A pressure gauge is usually placed that this end
of the tube, furthest away from the vac pump.
<p>
If you are going to choose the pre-mix bottled gas, the following will be
required:
<p>
On the bottle, you will need to firstly select a regulator, you will
need a dual reg type, that give you a gauge for bottle pressure (High
Pressure), and one for the gas flow (low pressure from the bottle).  For
separate gas you will need three regulators - big $$$.  (I am using going
the pre-mix route.)  From the low pressure side of the regulator, you will
then need to add a fine gas control valve to regulate the pressure of the gas
within the laser tube, this control can be achieved with a needle valve.
<p>
One the vacuum side of the laser tube, I suggest that you use another needle
valve so that you can shut off the tube from the pump during vacuum testing
and experiments.
<p>
This is basically the gas system setup for a CO2 laser. The vacuum/gas
requirements for a CO2 laser is much less critical than that of helium-neon or
argon ion laser, which require sophisticated vacuum equipment and very pure
gas supplies (even the slightest contamination may and will kill lasing in
these low gain type lasers).
<p>
Pressure in the tube is controlled by increasing or decreasing gas flow
through the tube.  This is done in conjunction with the voltage and current
to the tube.  The lower the voltage (and current), the less gas is required;
higher voltage, more gas.  Optical power is thus regulated by a combination
of power to the tube and gas pressure/flow.
<p>
For example, a typical Coherent slow flow CO2 laser operates as follows:
At laser turn-on, the High-voltage power is placed across the tube regardless
of whether the tube is gassed up or not.  Prior to the flow of gas, the laser
tube is first pumped down, once it has reached an appropriate vacuum, the gas
flow is started, and the laser will start to run. The output power is
regulated, by the gas flow, pressure, and tube voltage. 
<p>
Once you have been dealing with CO2 lasers for a while, you will get the
experience to know how the laser is running by looking at the discharge
and the colour.
<p>
Very little gas is actually needed during operation.  Depending on your usage,
a 'G' size bottle will last a very long time.
<p>
(From: Cesar Martinez (arterel@intercable.net).)
<p>
This is a comment from an e-friend who is an expert (and I DO mean expert) on
laser systems:

<blockquote>
"Gas flow is probably your most critical thing. In fact, if you hooked the
 gases to a roots blower, and blasted them through the cavity, you could up
 your output wattage. Fine control of the nitrogen, helium and CO2 gases is
 also critical. You will find that a perfectly tuned cavity won't lase, or
 lase very well if the gas mixtures are wrong. With experience you will be
 able to tune the gas mixture by watching the color or the excited gases
 within the glass tube."
</blockquote>

I'm glad he mentioned about being able to see the resonator. It will give you
many clues, such as gas leaks, etc. The color range you will actually see in
the lasing cavity, if the gas mixture is correct will be amber. Blue means too
much nitrogen and red means too much helium.



<h3><A NAME="cc2rgas">Regulating CO2 Gas Pressure and Flow Rate</A></h3>

Both the vacuum port and gas inlet port need to have valves (manual or
automatic) to obtain the desired pressure in the laser tube and gas flow rate.
<p>
Think of the system as being equivalent to two voltage sources (your vacuum
pump and gas supply tank) in series with a load (your tube), a resistor to the
positive (your inlet valve) and a resistor to the negative (your outlet valve).
Unless you have that second valve, your tube pressure (the voltage drop across
the load in this simulation) is determined by how fast your vacuum pump can
pull gas out (the pumps effective series resistance) relative to how fast
you let it enter (the 'resistance' of the first valve).  Thus, you could go
through gas at quite a clip. :)
<p>
For a basic setup, a needle valve following the tank pressure regulators and
a valve with a larger orifice in the vacuum line should suffice though it may
take some practice to get them set just right.  Of course, a nice servo
system where the operating pressure and flow rate can be dialed in would be
nice. :)
<p>
As for how to optimize output power and use of gas, start at low flow on inlet
needle valve and adjust the outlet valve to maintain the desired tube
pressure.  Increase the flow until output power starts leveling off.  I'd
expect you'll want to run at the highest pressure at which you can still
maintain a discharge since this will result in maximum power (though it may
be necessary to start the tube at a lower pressure) but above some flow rate,
you won't get significantly more power and will just waste gas.
<p>
(From: Steve Hardy (hardy@sweng.stortek.com).)
<p>
If you have roughly similar needle valves at each end, you will find
that the valve at the vacuum end 'chokes' the flow, and you will end
up with miserable power output.
<p>
There are several solutions to the problem of obtaining simultaneously
the correct rate of flow and tube pressure.

<ol>
<li>At the vacuum end, use a low pressure regulator.  The flow rate is then
 independently adjustable using the valve at the high pressure end.
<p>
<li>Use two valves.  The variables are no longer independently adjustable,
 but this is arguably easier for the amateur to achieve.
</ol>

The important thing to note about (2) is that the needle valves should
have different orifice sizes.  The high pressure end will use a fine
orifice, whereas the low pressure end needs a large orifice.  The reason
for this may be obtained by considering the pressure differences:
<p>
The mass flow rate of the gas must be constant through the entire system
at equilibrium, because of law of conservation of matter.  The pressure
drop across the high pressure valve will be of the order of 2 atm, whereas
the pressure drop at the low end will only be about 20mm Hg (or 1% that of
the high pressure end).
<p>
The high pressure valve thus requires about 100 times the 'resistance' to
gas flow than that of the low pressure valve.  In practice, this means that
you should <b>not</b> use a 'needle valve' at the low pressure end.  Rather,
you should use a ball or gate valve which is designed for higher flow
rates.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc28">Air-Cooled CO2 Lasers</A></h3>

Even though the CO2 laser is among the most efficient, this still doesn't say
much!  At best, you will get 20 percent electrical->optical efficiency for the
tube.  Home-built CO2 lasers could do a lot worse.  For a 50 W laser at 20
percent efficiency, 400 W needs to be dissipated as heat.  At 10%, this goes
up to 450 W!  Depending on a variety of factors including the type and quality
of your mirrors, it could be even less.  While it is possible to get rid of
this amount of waste heat with a suitable heat sink and forced air cooling,
it takes more effort than a simple water jacket.  Flowing liquid is amazingly
effective due its specific heat being 100s of times larger than air.
<p>
However, also realize that just preventing the tube from cracking or melting
isn't enough - lasing itself is affected by the temperature of the gas.  As it
heats up, the efficiency goes down further until you just have a poor excuse
for a gas discharge sculpture!
<p>
(From: Christopher R. Carlen (crobc@epix.net).)
<p>
You can do up to about 50 W without water cooling in a 1 meter long Pyrex tube.
Figuring 20% efficiency, that's 200 W dissipated by the tube.  Not unreasonable
for a 1 m long 1 to 2 cm bore tube.  Air cooling can be done as long as the gas
is flowing through the tube while running.  Hence we call these "flowing gas"
CO2 lasers (but not "gas-dynamic" which is a different topology altogether).
<p>
Water is needed for sealed tubes.  Reason:  We are not so much worried about
hurting the tube as we are about keeping the gas cool.  CO2 gets vibrationally
excited by a collision with electronically excited N2.  Thus, you need N2 to
make a CO2 laser.   There is a problem that happens when the plasma gets to
thermally hot.  Return to the ground state or something like that doesn't
happen.  You end up with all your CO2 or N2 stuck in some state that can't
lase.  Cooling makes the laser physics work.  Only at much higher powers do you
need to worry about melting anything.  Flowing gas provides a continuous supply
of cool gas.  The flow is not large.  A 1 Liter/minute vacuum pump will do, and
some very fine metering valves for the gases, fed to the valves at 2 to 3 psi.
<p>
Let me put it this way:  My boss did military research with GE and there they
built a 14 kW flowing gas CO2 laser.  It had about a 6 inch bore, and about
4 m long and did not require anything but air cooling.
<p>
Also, you need He to make a CO2 laser.  The He has a high thermal conductivity
and assists in transferring thermal energy from the N2 to the walls of the
tube.  CO2 laser won't work without N2 and He!
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
You're gonna have to liquid cool it unless you have heat sinks of some sort
clamped around the tube with lots of forced air.  Convection cooling probably
wont cut it.  You will get it to lase with no cooling for short periods of
time but even at its threshold, it will heat up enough for lasing to cease
even if it doesn't get hot enough to be damaged.

<h3><A NAME="cc2ignp">Ignition Coil Based CO2 Laser Power Supply</A></h3>

(From: Barry Benson (bensonbd@erols.com).)
<p>
You can use a pulsed HEI ignition coil for up to 1 kW (2 in parallel or series
for 2 kW).  Use 16 uF at 500 volts to pulse the ignition coil (under mineral
oil).  No HV diodes or neons needed.  Just a $20 ignition coil and a 2N688
or better SCR triggered by your favorite trigger circuit (555 + 2N2222).
It can use SCR snubber caps (SCRNxxxx) found at some Ham fests for a few
dollars.
<p>
HEI stands for High Energy Ignition - one of those newer vacuum Epoxy
impregnated very high voltage ignition coils on a squarish shaped core.  The
original article called for a Delco 523-D.  There are newer coils that have a
high voltage nipple to solve some of the interfacing problems from the older
design.  Go to a Track Auto or Auto Zone store and browse the ignition coils.
They are usually in a clear see through pack hanging up (used to be).  I can
get 6" sparks (>100 kV) between two coils without oil immersion.  You can also
get them at junk yards for a few dollars each.  They are wonderful for all
kinds of high voltage experiments.  You can drive them with transzorbs,
MOSFETs, SCRs, IGBTs, etc.
<p>
I ran one coil at 60 Hz (20 uF, 500 V per pulse) to simulate the discharge
from a neon sign transformer.  What I got was more like a pole transformer!
The coil got hot and melted after 10 minutes.  I concluded from that
experiment that the answer to high power was to bank the coils.
<p>
The pulse is a few tens of nanoseconds wide and about an A at about 50
kV.  This takes advantage of the magnetic pulse compression from the core
saturating to produce the high power pulse.  The CO2 lasers ran at about 10 Hz
and would easily cook boards.
<p>
Here is the article, upon which this was based:

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc29">RF or Microwave Power Supply for CO2 Laser?</A></h3>

HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers require a concentrated discharge in a narrow (order
of 1 mm) bore.  The most convenient means of achieving this is via DC
excitation as discussed in the chapters: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpstoc">HeNe
Laser Power Supplies</A> and <A HREF="laseraps.htm#apstoc">Ar/Kr Ion Laser
Power Supplies</A>.  However, some HeNe lasers are powered by RF sources with
external electrodes positioned in such a way as to force a discharge in the
bore.  I don't know whether this can be done with ordinary HeNe tubes with
wide envelopes - the examples I have seen were on expensive research lasers
with custom tubes and external mirrors.
<p>
However, for the wide bore CO2 laser, RF excitation is much easier and many
commercial CO2 lasers of all sizes are RF excited.  Even narrow bore CO2
lasers can be RF excited with the proper electrode configuration.  Therefore,
it might be possible to power your home-built CO2 laser using the output of a
radio transmitter or RF power oscillator, or using the magnetron and its power
supply from a microwave oven.  While this would eliminate the DC electrodes,
there will be significant challenges involved in efficiently and safely
coupling the RF or microwave energy into the discharge.  For RF, a coupling
transformer will be needed for impedance matching.  For microwaves, it may be
possible to make the laser tube out of metal and an extension of the feed
waveguide from the magnetron if it is wide enough (microwave ovens run at
2.45 GHz - about 5 inches).
<p>
However, keep in mind that there will be significant losses incurred converting
electrical power to RF or microwaves and coupling them to the plasma discharge.
Wall plug to output beam efficiency is probably cut by at least a factor of
two compared to a direct DC discharge unless the efficiency of the discharge
coupling is much higher.  Difficulties in maintaining uniform excitation over
the length of the laser tube further limits performance.  And, if you are
thinking about ganging multiple sources together, unless they are all
phase-locked together, there will be additional issues with respect to mode
interactions and beat patterns though with a little work, this can be dealt
with as well.
<p>
Therefore, I don't really see any significant advantages to this approach for
a small home-built CO2 laser, at least not initially.  A simple neon sign
transformer based power supply is probably a lot easier as well as being much
safer in a relative sort of way - although you can easily be electrocuted with
either power source, at least you won't be cooked from RF or microwave leakage
in the process!  One should NEVER underestimate the potential danger of several
hundred watts (or more) of RF or microwave radiation running around your
apparatus.  And, standing waves can appear in the strangest unexpected places
to attach the unsuspecting!

Also see the sections: <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2nov">Novel Idea for CO2
Laser</A> and <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2typ3">RF Excited CO2 Lasers</A>.
<p>
Now, more about the safety issues:
<p>
While it is true as far as I know that the only dangers of microwave radiation
relate to thermal effects, these should not be minimized in importance.  The
inner structures of the eye are particularly sensitive and has no pain or heat
receptors so there may be no warning before irreversible damage is done.  But,
other parts of the body which are equally highly valued can also be effected.
<p>
I think it is reckless of some to be so casual about this stuff, especially on
public forums like USENET newsgroups or email discussion groups.  I don't doubt
that those who do so probably have been trained or have enough experience that
they can avoid most of the dangers - or have just been lucky.  My concern is
for others who are NOT veteran RF jocks.  How about the 10 year old who is
listening in and might figure that defeating the safety interlocks on the
family microwave would be cool! :(  It is irresponsible to be giving the
impression that a kW of microwaves is nothing to worry about.
<p>
To some extent, people do this to defend their previous behavior since they
have gotten away with it SO FAR.  I don't think most of them are really stupid
but people can defend dumb things when their beliefs are questioned.  I'd just
rather be on the side of caution.
<p>
Furthermore, for lasers, guess what you have to do while adjusting mirrors
and optics?  GET NEAR THE LASER TUBE!!!!  I wouldn't want to do that with
1,000 W of RF or microwave energy 2 inches from my hand or head!  This isn't
like the recent cell phone cancer scare.  And, even at a distance, it doesn't
take much to focus a microwave source to produce a tight beam (a little sheet
metal near the magnetron) resulting in a hot spot where you least expect it,
or for the metal core or frame of your eyeglasses to decide to resonate at
2.45 GHz and arc or melt down on your face!
<p>
As for the high voltage, the output of any portion of a microwave oven power
supply is DEADLY.  As a simple comparison, a 15 kV, 60 mA neon sign transformer
can provide *only* a maximum of about 225 watts due to its current limited
construction.  That *can* kill you on a bad day but it isn't a sure thing.  A
typical 2,500 V microwave oven transformer can produce 2,500 W or MORE until
the breaker feels like tripping!  That will kill you on any day.  Experienced
microwave oven repair people who supposedly knew all the rules have been
electrocuted while just probing a powered unit.
<p>
A microwave oven power supply is probably the most electrically deadly thing
on the planet accessible to the curious (except perhaps climbing a 100,000 V
utility tower!).
<p>
Having said that:
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)   
<p>
I've been experimenting for quite some time with using a microwave oven
magnetron as an excitation source for neon art.  It works great!  Properly
coupled to a tube filled (in this case) with neon, the glow discharge is
impossible to look at!  Since a 1000 watt output magnetron can be had for the
cost of a microwave oven, this is about the cheapest power sources available
for laser excitation.  I made a 25mm tube and fabricated a coupling waveguide
out of aluminum foil to test this theory.  The tube looked like a laser beam
before it overheated and cracked!  (Make a note - leaded glass neon tubing is
unsuitable for high power plasma tubes. :-)
<p>
Multiple tubes can be easily arranged with the proper waveguiding 1/2
wavelength apart (about 2.5 inches) to operate as a single source and generate
higher power than is possible from a single magnetron.  They'll phase-lock to
each other and the power will sum.
<p>
And before the safety Nazis crank up on this, a note about microwaves.  The
hysteria of a few years ago about "microwave radiation (sic)) that went hand
in hand with the nuclear energy hysteria has many people believing that the
merest exposure to microwaves would lead to instant sterilization.  Nothing
could be further from the truth.
<p>
(Puts on his Health-Physicist hat)
<p>
The two are only distantly related.  Ionizing radiation (nuclear and X-ray)
causes biological damage by penetrating flesh and causing ionization when
finally absorbed.  The ionization produces free radicals which do the actual
damage.  Microwave (and other radio waves) are of too long a wavelength to
cause ionization (simplistic statement but adequate for this discussion).  The
only damage caused by microwaves is thermal.  That is, it can heat tissue
enough to kill it.  The most sensitive part of the body is the eye.  Microwave
exposure to the clear of the eye will coagulate it just like it will coagulate
the clear part of an egg.  Too much microwave and Voila!  Instant cataracts.
The inverse square law applies so distance is the best protection.  An
arms-length away is more than enough distance for a freely radiating magnetron
dipole.  Much more is needed if the beam is emitting from a waveguide.
<p>
The proper protective gear is a pair of screen goggles.  These are just what
they sound like - goggles containing a fine wire mesh.  Almost any mesh will
work as long as the openings are smaller than 1/4 wavelength at the frequency
of interest.  The frequency of a microwave oven magnetron is about 2.5 Ghz so
1/4 wave is about 30 mm.  (simple formula: wavelength = 300/(frequency in MHz)
<p>
One thing you have to be aware of is that it is very easy to inadvertently
form a resonant cavity with things like your hands.  It can be easily
demonstrated by cupping your hands near a magnetron antenna.  Juuuust right
and pow!!, smoke and flames erupt from your hand as arcs 'n sparks fly!  Don't
do this!  RF burns heal very slowly.  Just ask me how I know :-(
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
An S-band waveguide is about 2" by 3" inside, maybe a little larger.  Using
microwave energy would facilitate the excitation of mixtures and at pressures
that might not sustain a DC or low frequency AC discharge.  This might include
capillary bores that allow maximum gain by using the bore walls as part of
the cavity.  A long alumina or aluminum nitride tube with a 1 to 2 mm bore
might be useful for this.  Make it long enough and you end up with a
"mirrorless" high power laser where the end mirrors and OCs become less
critical. 
<p>
The tube in the <A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2mrc1">Merrimack 850</A>Merrimack
850</A> consisted of a 1 mm bore divided into short segments and ran at really
high pressures.  The pressure had to be lowered to start the discharge and then
brought up to about 80 Torr for maximum power.  With the electrodes only about
5 to 6 inches apart, this makes me tend to believe that hundreds of watts are
possible with RF excitation much more easily then they are with arrays of 150
mA transformers.
<p>
All you'd really have to do is make a long stretch of waveguide from sheet
copper or plated tin, stick a carbonized wood tetrahedron in the far end
for a dummy load and place the discharge tube in lengthwise, with some
tuning pins between it and the magnetron. if the tubes were small enough,
you could have more then one in the waveguide to add power. 
<p>
(From: Rainer Engelbrecht (rainer@lhft.eei.uni-erlangen.de).)
<p>
We did lots of work on microwave excitation of CO2 laser several years 
ago. The idea was that a magnetron with 1 kW RF power from a kitchen 
cooking microwave is an extremely efficient and cheap RF source.
<p>
Unfortunately, it didn't work too well (at least it did and will do!):
<p>
<li>Because of the short wavelength of 2.45 GHz it is difficult to realize 
 a homogeneous gas discharge over a large volume.
<p>
<li>The electric field strength needed to operate the gas discharge at 
 this frequency is much higher than in the HF region (say 13 or 27 MHz 
 which is what TRUMPF uses for its 10 kW CW CO2 lasers ...). So a CW 
 microwave discharge puts too much power into the discharge and the laser 
 gas gets too hot for efficient operation, especially for CO2 lasers.
<p>
<li>The work-around was to pulse the microwave with lets say 10% 
 duty-cycle and greater than 10 kHz repetition rate. Even then the efficiency 
 (microwave to laser power) was less then 5%. This is unacceptable for any 
 commercial use, compared to existing CO2 laser technology. And pulsing 
 the microwave valve adds really much complexity to the high-voltage 
 supply circuits and stresses the brave cooking magnetron. Pulsed radar 
 magnetrons would be a solution, but not a cheap one.
<p>
<li>RF and microwave excitation of HeNe lasers works! At least one of the 
 first HeNe lasers in Germany back in the sixties, built by my doctoral 
 father, Prof. Brand in Aachen, Germany, was RF excited. So did the first 
 HeNe laser by Bennet, Heriott and Javan, when I correctly remember 
 (although not at microwave frequencies).
<p>
<li>The colleagues who did the work were Wolfgang Oestreicher and Martin 
 Maerz. You might search Google or literature/science citation indices 
 for them and microwave and laser.
<p>
<li>Uhlenbusch in Germany did some really impressive microwave excited 
 lasers. Search for "Uhlenbusch" and "microwave" and "laser".

 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
If you're up to building a class-E RF amp that is electrically noisy and
needs to be very well shielded, then a 10 to 30 watt RF excited CO2 with
a 1/2" alumina bore maybe 14" long is not hard to build. You'd need a
whopper of a 24 VDC supply, a 2 kilowatt dummy load, a HF SWR meter and
some patience.
<p>
You'd need 250 to 400 watts depending on your gas and optics
<p>
I have two of them, if you don't mind a 10 per cent duty cycle it can be done.
and the head is hand held. If you do some hard searching on the net,
you might find a Pfizer laser division surgical laser, although Pfizer
left the laser biz after maybe 3 years, there are a lot of them out
there, plug into 110 VAC and you get this 1" diameter 16" long laser gun
like laser head with a fiber optic supplied HeNe aiming beam on a 5
foot cord attached to a PC sized RF amp and chiller.. I paid 100$ for
mine.
<p>
You'll also need a lathe, some expensive indium foil for the brass to
alumina compression seals, and a budget for an HR and OC.  And a 6" square
water to air heat exchanger, and a small water pump and glycol as the
coolant.  A 1/4" copper tube just laid alongside the bore is cooling the
alumina, hence the low duty cycle, but that's the only way it the cooling
can be done without absorbing RF.
<p>
Did I mention the vacuum system?  What I have are commercial sealed
units, but I have converted one to flowing gas when its mix died.
<p>
If you were a ham radio operator and already had the HF amp and the
vacuum pump, the laser I'm talking about could be easily built in a
day, and just substitute lead for the indium :-)

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2a">CO2 Laser on a Budget?</A></h3>

Some people don't ask for much:
<blockquote>
"I would like to construct a cheap CO2 laser that doesn't require special
 components and glass blowing skills."
</blockquote>

For those of us who are experienced scroungers and improvisors, the estimates
given below are probably way excessive.  However, where this is not the case,
expect to spend a few bucks.  Of course, that estimate of $100 might have been
in 1971 dollars!
<p>
The problem is that there are such a wide variation in what it will cost to
obtain things like vacuum pumps that it is hard to put prices on a completed
laser.  Depending on your resourcefulness, scavenger ability, and luck, it
could be less than $100 but it could also be a lot more.  But, if you haven't
anything set up now, there will be serious additional overhead.  An adequate
vacuum pump could easily blow the budget right there.
<p>
(From: Mark Wilson (wilson_mark@htc.honeywell.com).)
<p>
I have built several lasers in my life including a CO2 laser. That is how I
first got into glassblowing, building laser tubes and gas manifolds.  I built
about a 25 watt CO2 laser using stuff I scrounged up for very little money.
The laser tube was made using electrodes and tubing from the neon sign
industry. I cut the Brewster window angles at a glazer's shop, got the NaCl
windows donated from a salt company, used two refrigerator compressors in
reverse for the vacuum pump, and a neon sign transformer with a mercury
rectifier for the power supply. My cavity was constructed using extruded
aluminum for an optical rail, and -1/8th diopter eyeglass lenses for the
mirror blanks. I drilled a hole through the output mirror for the output beam,
and then gold coated the lens blanks using a sputtering system I built out of
a gallon jug bottle that I cut off. It was lots of fun, but difficult to scale
up to 100 watts. 
<p>
(From: Joe or JoEllen (joenjo@pacbell.net).)
<p>
Yes it possible to build a medium to high power laser with a limited budget
but even the best scrounger would have a tough time doing it for $100!  I
started building a multi-watt CO2 laser years ago but had a hard time
maintaining mirror alignment during pump-down (the corner-cutting design is to
use the end mirrors to seal the resonator in lieu of ZnSe Brewster windows
used in the commercial versions.  The design I used was a hybrid of the
Iannini version [3] and that from "Light and its Uses".
<p>
BTW, I also started building the argon laser featured in the same book.
<p>
(From: Dave (dave-a@li.net).)
<p>
I work for a CO2 laser manufacturer (name withheld) and it depends on what
you want to cut with it.
<p>
You'll need laser gas mix (on the cheap side), three flow meters (expensive),
and then either nitrogen or oxygen to cut depending what you are cutting,
polarizing mirrors, output mirrors, etc., etc.   It's going to be expensive
any way you look at it.  What are you trying to cut?  And how much wattage?
<p>
(From: Christopher R. Carlen (crobc@epix.net).)
<p>
On first note, if you are not experienced with electronics, you should know
that a CO2 laser power supply is VERY DANGEROUS.  The high voltage and high
current involved can quickly kill you.  There will be absolutely no room for
error.  Get acquainted with basic electronics, and then electrical safety
skills before setting out to build a laser power supply.
<p>
My plans for building a CO2 are not really plans, but rather practical
engineering formulas that come from a declassified old CO2 laser manual from
the U.S. Air Force's early experiments with CO2 and CO laser technology for
Star Wars applications.
<p>
My purpose for building the thing is, well quite simply, my professor told me
to do it.  He wants a CO2 laser on a long rail which will allow the cavity
length to be adjusted over a large range to demonstrate laser concepts to
optics students.  Plus, it should be a whole lot of fun, and a good experience
for me.
<p>
If you want to cut stuff, I would recommend a commercial CO2 or Nd:YAG laser,
from the surplus market.  Currently you can get something in the $1,500 to
$5,000 range that will do the job, and you will avoid a great deal of time
invested in building your own which might turn out to be disappointing, or
worse, deadly if you aren't sure what you're doing.
<p>
With respect to the cost of components alone needed to build your own CO2
laser, you must consider:
<ol>
<li>A heavy rail and precision optic mounts, maybe $300.
<p>
<li>High reflector and output coupler optics, maybe $200.
<p>
<li>Tube components, maybe $100 if you're clever enough.
<p>
<li>Power supply components, maybe $200.
<p>
<li>High vacuum pump, maybe $200 to $500 if you get a working used pump.
<p>
<li>Low pressure gauge, gas manifold and valve components, plumbing, and tank
 regulators, maybe $300 if you're determined enough to hunt at length for
 bargains.
<p>
<li>CO2, N2, and He tanks, maybe $100 to $200 to rent the tanks with fresh
 fill, but then you'll have to pay each month's rent on the tanks.
</ol>
<p>
I estimate about $1,500 at a minimum.
<p>
Well I would be highly surprised if anyone could really build a CO2 for $100
as mentioned at <A HREF="http://www.amazing1.com/">Information Unlimited</A>.  You must understand that they are a dealer in some good information, and much
highly suspect information.
<p>
(From: Dave (dave-a@li.net).
<p>
Damn that's cheap!  The CO2 (4.5 or 4.8) usually goes for a lot more then
that! Better the gas, the longer your optics will last.  The N2 and He are the
cheap ones (compared to CO2).  I just went through this with a customer.  He
bought 4.0 CO2 and there was a *major* jump in price to scientific grade (4.8
I think it was. 99.998%) The 99.99 wasn't good enough.  Though he should get
away with premix (Mazack I now uses/used premix).
<p>
But you're right, buy a surplus 'head' its cheaper.  Plus you now have a
working unit that you can modify to tweak up the power :).

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2b">Chris Carlen's Notes on CO2 Laser Design and
 Construction</A></h3>

(From: Christopher R. Carlen (crobc@epix.net).)
<p>
I built a CO2 laser with a 1 meter glass tube with a bore of about 2.5 cm and
machined aluminum fittings which seal to the ends with O-rings.  It has KCl
optical windows (these cannot sit in the atmosphere or they will cloud due to
moisture attack; they must have a heat lamp pointed at them when out of the
storage dessicator) perpendicular to the tube axis.  KCL windows are cheap,
$55 per window.   No Brewster windows because this tube was originally for a
CO laser, and the whole thing had to be plunked in liquid N2 for cooling.  So
the researchers had other priorities than designing Brewsters.
<p>
Actually, it is better to not use windows with a CO2, because of the high
intracavity IR flux.  Just put the HR and OC on the tube directly.  My next
design I plan to use commercial mirror mounts (check out
<A HREF="http://www.thorlabs.com/">ThorLabs, Inc.</A>) and braze a
bellows style vacuum pipe to the mirror mount.  I can then seal the pipe to
the tube end with some method, maybe just flanges with O-rings or epoxy.  Then
the optics need to be sealed to the mounts.  Some sort of reversible method
would be preferable.  ThorLabs has a prism table that could be custom machined
to give a larger seating rim than their standard 1" mirror mounts.  Then a
cover flange and O-ring could be fitted.  Note that I don't design for minimum
cost, but rather, maximum repairability and modular construction.
<p>
Back to the laser that is completed:  It has a copper HR and ZnSe OC.  ZnSe
really is the best.  About $150 to 200 for each cavity optic, new.  Get a Janos
(optics supplier) catalog and some others, just look in a Laser Focus World or
on the web.  This stuff really isn't that hard to get.  Getting surplus parts
for a power supply is harder.  The optics really aren't the place to go
surplus.  I rarely get flawless specimens from any surplus houses.
<p>
Pick up a ZnSe lens while your shopping as well, you'll need it to focus the
beam for frying things.  Although, you could use a cheap metal spherical
mirror, a lens is safer, because it's easier to know where the focussed beam
is going.
<p>
You must calculate the parameters (optic focal lengths as a function of tube
length) for a stable cavity resonator.  This is the only non-wing-it part of
the laser design.  For a 1 m tube, a 1 m focal length on the HR with a flat OC
works.  This is a simple calculation, but I don't have the equation handy.
It's just a simply inequality.  Get a physicist to do it for you (I did) or a
laser engineering book.  There is a lot of slop on this calculation, like I
said, it's an inequality.
<p>
An OC of about 60% reflectance and anti-reflection coated on the outside
surface is what you want.  There are research papers around with charts of
laser efficiency and stuff versus reflectance.  There are ways to optimize
this, but for the dimensions we're talking about 60% will work.  If you can
build the hardware, believe me, this laser is very easy to make work once you
turn it on.  CO2 really wants to lase!
<p>
I have read some research that suggests that the power output is *independent*
of tube bore diameter.  So if you want a beam that exhibits lots of TEM modes,
make a fat tube.  A TEM00 needs a narrow tube, maybe less than 5mm.  
<p>
Our laser was built on a 1 x 1 x 8 foot solid block of granite, once
used for a surface plate in a machine shop.  It had been bored and metal things
sunk in with 1/4-20 tapped holes, standard for research optics mounting
equipment.  This is not something you pick up at Home Depot.  Next time I plan
to use an aluminum I-beam, about 4" on a side.  I think this should be
sufficiently rigid, and is easy to drill and tap for bolting down your optics
mounts and tube mounting hardware.  About $100 new for a 6 foot piece, but I'm
sure there are cheaper substrates.
<p>
I have pumped about 50 W of electrical power into our laser, and haven't
measured the output power, because I didn't have a power meter for this range
of power and wavelength until just a few days ago.  Qualitatively, I estimate
about 1-2 W of output power.  The tube had dual anodes and one central cathode,
so each arm receives about 3500 V at 7.5 mA.  This is just enough current
density to reach the lasing threshold.  Thus, I am sure that a heftier power
supply, like around 300 to 500W will result in an output power in the 30 to
50 W range.  Figure on 10% efficiency, varying from 5% at threshold to 20% if
you do everything just right.  That means conceivably almost 100 W from a 1 m
tube with 500 W in.  50 W is almost guaranteed.  No water cooling is needed
with a flowing gas laser.  This is good because you can design an extremely
simple tube with no glass to metal seals, just a pipe with some expanded
sections and "T"s, have the edges diamond ground square (need thick walls) and
you can epoxy the electrodes in.  Get a few diamond drills, assemble the
electrodes, epoxy them into a small hole drilled through a heavy glass plate,
and epoxy the plate to the machined surface on the tube.  Doing this stuff
yourself will make the tube glassblowing investment a minimum.  
<p>
This is what I plan for next time, but the current laser has six port tubes
ground to 1/4" and 1/2" diameters to fit Swagelok standard fittings.  I sealed
off two of them with Teflon Swagelok fittings (get a Swagelok catalog, all
your gas parts can come from there).  Two others I put vacuum hoses leading to
a T and to the gas mixing manifold.  This tube feeds gas in at the anodes, and
flows toward a large central port with the cathode.  A Fernco (yes, from the
plumbing department at Home Depot) and some PVC pipe fittings allowed a vacuum
connection and an electrical feed-through (1/8" steel wire epoxied through the
PVC pipe) to connect to the cathode.  The other two ports have anode pins fed
through a glass capillary, sealed with epoxy, and fitted to the tube with a
Teflon Swagelok.
<p>
The cathode must be large and heavy for it will dissipate a large portion of
the heat generated in the tube.  It is good to keep in the middle, using the
dual anode design.  That way heavy ions flow away from the optics at the ends
of the tube, and the optics don't get sputtered by metal bouncing off a nearby
cathode.  Anodes don't sputter and they can be just metal pins sticking into
the tube.
<p>
I made a cathode from a 1"dia. x 2" long copper plumbing pipe coupler, silver
brazed (NOT solder) to a washer and a nut at one end, so I could screw it onto
a threaded rod hanging down the vacuum port, the rod being brazed to the steel
wire feed-through.  This whole laser is like an erector set: almost nothing is
permanently stuck together with wads of aesthetically unappealing vacuum
sealing wax.
<p>
I used Swagelok metering valves.  The "S" series valves are good with a small
laser system and a vacuum pump around 25 to 50 L/min.  I used ordinary gases;
didn't ask for any special purity, from the welding shop.  I think purity is
only a big deal for sealed CO2 lasers.  Flowing gas lasers are less critical.
I used a 25 L/min vacuum pump capable of 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr ultimate vacuum,
but I never got below 0.5 torr on my gauge (about 0.5 torr was the smallest
pressure it could resolve).  Probably due to the metering valves being
designed not for full shut-off and the Fernco connector, which was really a
kludge to get the tube connected to the pump.  I didn't have any say about the
odd large size of the vacuum port, about 1.5" diameter, too large for vacuum
hose and I didn't want to spend for a custom machined O-ring fitting.  You
need *metering valves* to adjust the pressures very precisely.  Full shut-off
isn't so important.  They come close enough.  You can test your vacuum
integrity by just leaving the metering valves wherever, and shut off the post
regulator valves, which are the real shutoff valves, in addition to the tank
valves.
<p>
I don't know what to say about pressure gauges.  There are gauges that read in
1mm notches down to 0 torr.  This is just good enough resolution to work with.
You want about 8 to 10 mm He, 1 to 2 mm N2, and 0.5 to 1.5 mm CO2.  About
0.5 to 1.0 mm of miscellaneous mixed gases leaking in when everything is
closed won't stop the laser from working.
<p>
To get better resolution, there are two choices, an ion gauge tube, but these
read from 1 mm on down to like 10^-7 mm, not the right range for what we're
doing.  The other choice is an Hg McLeod gauge, but this is a cantankerous
instrument, fragile, and full of Hg.  Oh yeah, expensive too.
<p>
If you're an EE, you know a zillion ways to make 6 to 8 kV DC supply at 20 to
100mA.  A crude linear supply with no regulation is fine.  Figure on dropping
about 3000 to 4000 V across the tube, and another 2000 to 4000 across ballast
resistors.  When you apply power the discharge will strike reliably with
a supply around 7000 to 8000 V.  6000 V or less sometimes works, but design
for 8 kV, I think.  Then you can't go wrong.  A Variac and some taps on a
resistor bank will allow you to adjust tube current to get what you want.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2c">Carl's Notes on CO2 Laser Design and
 Construction</A></h3>

(From: Carl Ijames (ijames@netaxs.com).)
<p>
I built a CW CO2 laser about 10 years ago that made about 30 to 40 W - enough
for a white hot spot 1 cm diameter on a firebrick.  If you have access to a
college library, get a book called "CO2 Lasers" by W.W. Duley.  It is very
readable and he goes over all the design criteria like optical cavity
length/diameter, gas mix, pressure, tube current, etc.  I also found some
articles in journals like Applied Optics from the early 70's that had some
construction articles - go through Chemical or Physics Abstracts from back
then to find them.  One had a design where they used a condenser as the
discharge tube (this is a piece of glassware from a chemistry lab that is
about 40 cm long, 1 cm ID, and has a water jacket most of its length.
Connections are standard ground glass tapers at each end.  They made up
fittings to go in each end that had the electrodes and windows/mirrors.
<p>
I tried using their idea with two condensers in series but the middle joint
(with no water jacket) got too hot.  You get about 100 W/meter from these
lasers, so even one condenser would give at least 25 to 35 W.  Since I was
working on a PhD in chemistry at the time, I finally just had our glassblower
make me a tube with a water jacket about 60 cm long, with thoriated tungsten
electrodes sealed into sidearms at each end, with a female ground glass taper
joint at each end.   Then, I machined some aluminum end caps with a male taper
to match and a flat end with an O-ring groove about 3/4" in diameter and three
tapped holes around that.  I bought a flat, front silvered mirror with a SiO2
coating and a germanium window with one side flat and the other concave with a
focal length of 1 meter, with the flat side AR coated and the concave side
uncoated which gave a reflectivity of about 40% given Ge's index of refraction
(I'm working from memory so I could be a little off here), for $40 and $350,
respectively, from Janos Optical.  For Ge windows, the limit before you need
to start cooling the window is about 50 to 100 W, so this worked fine for me.
<p>
The mirrors were 1 inch diameter round, abut 1/4" thick.  I set the mirrors on
the O-rings and made a flat plate to go over them so I could align it by
varying how far I tightened them into the o ring.  Not the most elegant, but
it was simple, cheap (no extra windows to buy or mounts to make), and worked
great.  Eventually you will get sputter deposits on the optical surfaces
exposed to the discharge, but I left a few inches between the electrodes and
the mirror surfaces and didn't see any problem for the year I used the laser.
<p>
Just buy a cylinder of pre-mixed CO2-He-N2, and it will last a long, long time.
I fed the gas in through a fitting on one mirror mount and pumped through the
other with a small Sargent-Welch rotary pump.  Operating pressure was 1 to 5
Torr and tube current was 10 to 25 mA.
<p>
I scrounged a 35 kV supply and used a several Kohm ballast resistor (forget
the value).  The tube was easy to light as long as the pressure was under 2 to
3 torr, but I could get more output by turning the pressure up to about 5 to
10 torr after the discharge lit.  I was worried about getting a discharge in
the gas line running to the cylinder so I used a frit as a pressure restriction
in the fitting on that mirror mount.  That way the line was at 5-10 psi when
the tube was under vacuum (and yes, I used plastic tubing :-).)  Anyway, enough
rambling - get Duley's book, it's a great resource.

<p>
For my CO2 laser, the turned aluminum ends/optics holders ARE the electrodes.
Just hook the neon sign transformer to them. The coolant is also in contact
with the high voltage (not the best idea, but it worked). I started with plain
tap water being recirculated from/to a 5 gallon bucket. The water started to
break down after a while, so I started using ethylene glycol (the stuff in
antifreeze) because it's not conductive.
<p>
What you have is 2 concentric Pyrex tubes. The inner tube is the laser bore
and the outer tube forms the cooling jacket. Turn some aluminum pieces on a
lathe so that the glass tubes can be epoxied to them (turn some grooves for
the glass to fit into). Drill and thread some holes in the side of the
aluminum so that you can let gas into the inner tube and water into the space
between the tubes. Drill a hole through the axis of the end pieces so the
inner tube (bore) is open to air. Place an o-ring around the outside of each
of these holes and the optics rest on the o-rings. An aluminum plate (with a
hole in it for the beam) mounts over the optic on 3 adjustment screws. Do the
same for the rear mirror, except you don't need the hole for the beam. The
plate presses against the optic, which seals it against the o-ring. The o-ring
is thick enough to allow some play for adjustment.
<p>
I know all of this seems overly simple and "rigged" together. The reason for
this is, is BECAUSE IT'S THIS SIMPLE!! All this really is, is a glass tube
filled with (not very) low-pressure gas that has high voltage on it. A neon
sign is just about as complicated. You don't need high vacuum. You don't need
fancy power supplies. Go out and get your Pyrex tubing and some aluminum rod
about 2" to 3" in diameter. 8" long is plenty. Start finding out about your
mirrors. Get a submersible pump. Find a vacuum pump.

<h3><A NAME="cc2tntc">Tony's Cautions About CO2 Laser Tube
 Construction</A></h3>

(From: Tony Adams (tonyadams@amthome.freeserve.co.uk).)
<p>
I built my first tube using 22 mm Pyrex tubing Epoxied (JB Weld) into 22 mm
copper pipe fittings.  I used 2 at each end, one to support the mirror mount
and the second separated by a short length of glass for the electrode and gas
inlet/vacuum pump.  There was 24" of tube between the electrodes surrounded by
a Perspex (Plexiglas) cooling jacket.  The Epoxy didn't soften or burn, but
the tube eventually cracked due to the expansion of the electrodes as they
heated up. I got about an hour of lasing out of it.  Don't use ordinary
araldite type Epoxy, as this will soften.  If you just want to see a beam in a
hurry this will work, but don't expect it to last and do expect to re-align
the optics every few minutes.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2d">Steve's Notes on Boosting CO2 Laser Power and Quality
 Construction</A></h3>

These comments were prompted by a question as to the possibility of using a
really long tube to increase power from a flowing gas CO2 laser.
<p>
(Portions from: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Hum after using a 24 watter, great on glass and wood, but kind of a slouch
on thin metal unless it had a heavy layer of rust or paint to get it
started.  You might also be able to reach 100 watts or more using a folded
resonator. I have seen a few pictures of 200 and 400 watt units that are
constructed like this, and often they have the tube electrically segmented
for multiple excitation. 
<PRE>

               OC _    _ HR 
                  |    |

</PRE>
Lead glass does come 8 foot lengths in larger diameters.  However, it's rather
unwieldy to have them shipped and most glass is sold in 4 foot lengths. Pyrex
in 8 foot is probably a special order.  There is no reason why you cannot cut
the glass and make an intermediate length. 
<p>
However, the problem is not so much the 8 or 12 foot tube as it is a 8 or 12
foot resonator to maintain the mirror alignment. I have aligned 7.5 foot
argons.  That task can take as much as 3 to 4 hours to get right.  On an 8
foot laser, you can easily detect the change in power if you move it, lean on
it, touch it, bump it, turn a screwdriver on it, or otherwise stress the
resonator.  And without careful design, pulsations in cooling or from the
vacuum pump might show up as well.  On an 8 footer, you're going to need bore
straigteners to prevent sag.
<p>
There are other ways to scale the laser power, i.e. increasing the bore
diameter, increasing the current, and changing the optics to produce a
multimode beam.
<p>
My vote is it's better to keep it short and scale the diameter or fold it.
That way you can get the required stiffness in the resonator supports
cheaply. It's one thing if you can set it up some place and leave it
permanently. It's quite another if your building it in a common use space with
the wife and kids. A four footer could get away with using 1/4-20 screws for
the mirror adjustments, but a 8 footer is going to need 1/4-80 or 3/16-100
screws. On the long lasers you'll see the backlash in the screws show up as
power fluctuations and can see the springs relax and sag on the power meter.
Short stiff lasers don't exhibit this very much. 
<p>
I talked to my friend who used to work in a laser job shop. Their 3.2 kW CO2
laser was only 4 feet long and its discharge path was 3 only feet or so. It
had a transverse discharge, the electrodes ran along  tube sides. It used a
fast gas flow and recirculated the gas. The tube diameter was large,
several inches across.   That means nearly 100 watts should be obtainable
in a 4 foot glass tube. The trick, according to him, is the cooling of the
gas.  The gas and the tube walls have to be cold.
They had 4 turbine like  blowers to recirculate the gas and run it
to chillers.
<p>
What I have seen on commercial lasers is to have one common electrode in the
middle and an electrode at each end with two power supplies sharing the common
electrode:
<PRE>

            ||----------------------------------------------------||
         HR ||-. .-------------------. .----------------------. .-|| OC
               | |                   | |                      | |  
               ' '                   | |                      ' '

                                 Vacuum Port

</PRE>
This results in twice the excitation for a given length.  With the this
arrangement the suction port can be in the middle with the gas supply at the
ends.  The power supply can be AC or DC.  However, while DC power is more
complex, it is preferred for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>With HV1 and HV2 being the anodes and HV Return being the cathode, any
 sputtering (which takes place mostly at the negative electrode) is kept well
 away from the mirrors or Brewster windows.
<p>
<li>The use of DC may also enable slightly more output power to be achieved
 compared to AC excitation since the current can be adjusted for optimal
 performance and is continuous.
</ul>
A pair of DC power supplies or a single supply with separate ballast resistors
(to divide the current) can be used - positives to HV1 and HV2, negative to HV
Return.
<p>
However, in powering such a laser using neon sign transformers (AC or DC), care
must be taken because many of these have centertapped secondaries with the
centertap connected to the case - which really must be grounded for safety.
Using a single centertapped transformer feeding HV1 and HV2 is possible.
Where multiple transformers are involved, attempting to float the case(s) is
not only dangerous but may result in insulation breakdown
<p>
Perhaps the best way to build a laser like this is to use Conflat flanges.
These are a standard laboratory vacuum hardware part. What I have in mind is
a stainless steel flange with a Pyrex glass-to-metal seal on each end. A
variety of options are available with these such as blank flanges, tees,
bellows, etc.  The hardware is interchangeable from company to company and
around the world, comes in a variety of metals, and depending on the type
are either bolted or clamped together.  I prefer the bolted ones versus the
clamped ones as the clamped ones use O-rings. Any plumbing part you can
imagine is made with standard flanges and available off the shelf. 
<p>
So you can make a tube with no intracavity windows to zap power. The
glass-to-metal flanges are only available in Pyrex or quartz, but the
associated glassblowing is not hard if you have a decent oxy-propane torch.
It's basically a straight join and can easily be done on a bench by hand with
some practice on normal straight tubing. 
<p>
With a little work, you could fit the electrodes in the flange and thus
make them replaceable.  It can also make it so that the tube only has two
glassblowing operations - i.e., two straight joins, and the rest is done with
blocks bolted to the flanges. The blocks can serve as the optics holder, gas
fill ports, electrodes and tube mounts.  So you could order a lab condenser
and two flange assemblies and have all your glasswork as COTS (Commercial
Off-The-Shelf) products.   If you had a desire for a 8 foot tube, you could
just join two standard assemblies at the flange. 
<p>
Each flange assembly adds about 3" of glass to the laser and can be baked at up
to 400 &deg;C once properly glassed on.  With that 3" between the metal
flange and the actual join, you would only have to flame anneal the Pyrex at
the join without worrying about stressing the glass-to-metal seal. Pyrex is
pretty forgiving if you keep it warm.
<p>
I don't have a current catalog to look up the Pyrex, but it is usually 2 to
3 times the price of the neon lead glass and is sold by the pound. 
<p>
Some examples from the Dunniway Stockroom catalog (not the most inexpensive
nor perhaps the best for glass-to-metal seals, they also don't stock raw glass):
<ul>
<li>Stainless Steel to Pyrex 1.33" Conflat flange to 7740 Pyrex, 3/4" OD glass
 with 1 mm wall: $64 each.
<li>SST to Pyrex, 2-3/4" inch Conflat flange, 1-1/2" glass OD: $71 each.
<li>Copper gaskets for the flanges: $16 per 10 pack. 
<li>4" bellows with KF 16 flange: $45 each 
<li>A blank off flange: $16 each. 
</ul>
The metal is a little pricey but you're paying for quality machining to get
a vacuum tight seal with almost no effort. This is Tinkertoy bolt together
stuff but high quality.  After all, the lab boys use it to approach vacuum
levels of outer space.  
<p>   
So you could have a tube made like this:
<PRE>
         BF BEL  BLK GS     Tube     GS BLK  BEL BF  
          [>><<][{{{][================][}}}][>><<]
</PRE>
Where:
<ul>
<li>BF = blank flange with mirror attached.
<li>BEL = bellows.
<li>BLK = aluminum block with gas fill hole and HV connection.
<li>GS = glass to metal seal. 
</ul>
This ends up being a quality commercial grade that can be rebuilt.  You can
also cut the glass to metal flanges off the tube and reuse them once or twice.
The rest of the parts are reusable except the copper gaskets if used. 

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2e">Steve's Non-Standard Experiments with a CO2 Laser
 Head</A></h3>

Ok, I have a known aligned flowing gas head setting here.  We're in the middle
of a bad flu epidemic in Ohio.  Things are going wrong, as we're also getting
lake effect snow.  Normally Ohionians are prepared for the mass of arctic air
that flows down from the Canadian North that then gets superchilled passing
over Lake Erie dumping the same kind of snow on northeastern Ohio that Buffalo
NY gets. Between the flu and the snow, suffice it to say my tank of laser mix
didn't get here and if it does get here the price is gonna be way up. In a
attempt to make me happy, they did hand me a refill tank of 80% Argon 20% CO2.
<p>
So I figured, what the heck, a little experimental physics never hurt anyone. 
I took a piece of thermal chart paper, hung it over the output end of the tube.
Jury-rigged a needle valve up, and just stuck Tygon and rubber tubing
everywhere.  No clamps, just friction fits. This pumped down to well below
what my 0 to 40 Torr mechanical gauge could detect. My thermocouple gauge has
a blown tube, but suffice it to say, it was down there.
<p>
I knicked a little hole in a piece of the tubing to let in a little air and
hooked a 15 kV, 60 mA neon sign transformer across it, just raw AC.  This tube
is 3/4" diameter with a 40" long arc between aluminum block electrodes.  Its
got a removable cooling water jacket. I got a good air glow, and as expected,
didn't observe any lasing on air.  This was just to test the discharge.  The
tube has clean internal mirrors.  I found out the hard way that a needle valve
on the pump-end as well as the fill-end didn't hurt.  This is well into the
molecular flow range, so my pump was 'too good'.  Without choking the pump, I
was really pulling down the tank fast.  This is because all my flow paths were
1" or 3/4", really overkill.
<p>
Normally I'd expect to see 15 to 20 Torr on a laser like this to maintain a
discharge, I've got the mech gauge right at the pump input.  Well, to get a
stable glow in 80:20 Ar:CO2, it was down in the 4 to 5 Torr range.  When I lit
it up, I kept looking at the wood block I had as a beam stop. No smoke. Drat.
Stuck thermal paper on it. Nada. 80:20 doesn't like to ignite or conduct much
either. More then once I watched my Tygon and Latex light up as it looked for
better paths. The thermal paper was getting warm at the OC however.  I
reopened the little leak to air, bingo, really hot chart recorder paper.  I
put in a black anodized plate, it got warm.  Bingo, power meter time: 2.5
watts or so spread over a big beam, not gonna burn anything. Oh I didn't flow
the cooling water, just filled the jacket and gave it time to cool down every
so often.  If I flowed it, I'd bet I'd get mondo more power.
<p>
The moral of the story, you need the laser mix. Other lessons learned: Good 10
turn needle valves can't be stressed enough.  Mine were 5 bucks each at a
surplus store.  The needle valve is a fine trim, the regulator pressure was
the course setting. You might need one at each end. I used a cruddy regulator
that didn't work well at the low end, settings were 1 to 7 psi as I
experimented. The best way I found to set up the leak was bubble the gas
through a beaker about 3" deep with water.  When I had about 3 bubbles a
second out of a 1/4" tube, it was set about right for starting the tube.
<p>
Tygon works as did heavy Latex.  A 4 liter per second pump was almost
overkill.  Putting an adsorber on a thermocouple or jury-rigged diode
temperature sensor is a must unless you have a fancy wavelength converter
plate to visualize the beam.  I don't. (see <A
HREF="http://www.macken.com/">Macken Instruments Inc.</A>.) Lab grade plumbing
was NOT needed but would help. Ideally, you'd have a solenoid valve on the gas
mix to conserve it.  Cheaper hardware store hardware is usable for the rest of
the plumbing provided you have a good lab type turnoff valve after your
regulator to conserve gas while setting up. The gas trapped between the
regulator and the tank valve was enough to go a couple of minutes at 2200 psi.
<p>
Pure lasing mix has a pretty "cool white" color like a fluorescent tube when
I've seen it in the past.  Normally the brightness of the tube light goes up
with laser intensity, then levels off as you increase pressure, a little
before lasing levels off. If you keep cranking in more gas after that, lasing
goes down and discharge brightness takes a dive.  80-20 argon/co2 glows a pale
grayish blue, very faintly.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2f">Terry's Comments on Effects of CO2 Laser Tube
 Size</A></h3>

(From: Terry Greene (xray@cstel.net).)
<p>
I'm not sure what the voltage requirements based on tube length and bore size
will be but it won't be hard to figure out. Just overkill the voltage rating
of the power supply (e.g., neon sign transformer), start with the Variac
adjusted down and adjust it up until it lases and the current is right. This
is the recommended procedure for the Iannini laser. The importance of the
voltage is to break down the gas to start the current flow. The longer the
bore (the effective gap) the higher the voltage required to breach it. Gas
pressure is also  important. Higher gas pressure needs more voltage for
breakdown (Paschens Law). Once the gas is passing current, the current density
per bore area is the important thing. Required current flow should be a
function of bore diameter. A 3/4 bore works well at 50 mA (at least that's the
recommended current for the Iannini laser). It stands to reason that adjusting
the current with the area of the bore would keep the current density the same. 
These numbers won't be exact because the inside diameter won't be this large
but for example:
<ul>
<li>3/4" bore = aproximately .44 square inch area
<li>1" bore = aproximately .79 square inch area
</ul>
So, to find the 'optimal' current for the 1" bore, we have: 50 mA * .79/.44 =
89.5 mA.
<p>
I suspect that maximum current density will be limited by your pump
displacement or how fast it can move the gas out of the bore at the required
vacuum. Higher current densities, while making more optical output, break down
the CO2 into CO at a faster rate. Beyond a certain point, higher current will
drop optical output as it kills the gas and you end up with a bore full of
dead gas. This problem is, of course, magnified in longer bores.  

<h3><A NAME="cc2fclc">Flavio's Comments on Long CO2 Lasers Tubes</A></h3>

(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)
<p>
I have researched the issues with operating a CO2 laser tube over a meter
long.
<p>
I do not recommend having a plasma tube of more than about 800 mm in length as
there my be problems with sustaining the discharge.  A 15 kV, 30 mA neon sign 
transformer will not be enough in striking a tube of this size - even a 15 kV,
60 mA transformer may have some troubles.
<p>
A typical CO2 laser operates at around 10 to 20 (some may be a little higher)
At this pressure, there is a lot more resistance in the gas, thus making it
more difficult to strike and maintain a discharge.  The higher the pressure,
the higher these voltages will be.  Unlike a HeNe laser, not only is it
difficult to start, but it will require an over all higher voltage to sustain
the discharge.
<p>
I have seen one of the Coherent medical CO2 lasers.  I uses a 15 kV, 60 mA
transformer on a tube only 24" in length and a diameter of 10 mm.
<p>
I initially was going to make my CO2 laser tube 1 meter long with a bore
diameter of 20 mm powered off of a 15 kV, 60 mA neon sign transformer.
However, in the end, I felt that there would be trouble with starting a tube
of that length so I have employed a tube length of only 800 mm.
<p>
For my tube, I chose a bore size of 20 mm ID x 24 mm OD. The larger bore
will generate more power.
<p>
My recommendations is either to do the following before constructing the
plasma tube:
<ol>
<li>Keep the tube length down. I have opted for 800 mm - should be much easier
 to sustain a discharge.
<p>
<li>If you are going to implement a tube longer than this, try an experiment
 before doing the complete fabrication:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Take the tube, and two cork bungs, and insert one at each end of the tube
 (make an airtight seal) and insert two wires so that they can connect to your
 power supply.  Connect one end to your vacuum pump and pump down the tube to
 a decent vacuum (e.g., 1 Torr).
<p>
<li>Apply power to the tube.
<p>
<li>Slowly backfill the tube with the laser gas mix, while watching the vacuum
 gauge.
</ol>
<p>
At this point, when you first start the follow of gas, you should be able to
ionize the gas. As gas pressure builds, you will eventually reach a threshold
point to where the input voltage is not sufficient to maintain discharge -
read the vacuum gauge.  What is the gas pressure in Torr?  Typical operation
of a CO2 laser is 10 to 20 Torr.  If you are at or above 20 Torr, then your
power supply is adequate for the tube length.  If not, you need a higher
voltage power supply or a shorter tube.
</ol>
<p>
I know that in a commercial Coherent CO2 laser system, the high voltage is
always applied to the tube - regardless if there is gas present in the tube. I
guess this is to facilitate the starting of the laser.

<h3><A NAME="cc2jcso">John's Comments on Starting Out in Home-Built CO2 Laser
 Construction</A></h3>

(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
First, one of the very basic rules in life is to take to heart the concept of
KISS.  That is, Keep It Simple, Stupid!  Complexity confuses, obscures
problems, impacts reliability and tends to cause one to never finish the
project.  One area where this applies is with respect to tube length. I think
you're needlessly complicating your life and your design trying if your
initial goal is a high power laser requiring along plasma tube.  You will be
trying to invent complex ways to make it work.  Not only will you then be
trying to debug a new laser design, you'll also be trying to debug a complex
driver.  You can get enough power to be dangerous AND enough power to learn
the characteristics of a CO2 laser with a tube only a foot or so long.  You
can drive it with an ordinary neon sign transformer, a device that is
stone-cold reliable and therefore doesn't have to be debugged.  Making your
first laser work is going to be enough of a challenge.  And with a neon sign
transformer, when (not if) you make contact with an energized conductor, you
might wish you were dead but you won't BE dead like you would with the
fractional-amp, 25 kV driver that might be needed for that big laser.
<p>
The second basic rule of science is to set up the experiment and then change
only ONE thing at a time.  Then evaluate the results before making another
change.  If you change X things, you have X!  (factorial) degrees of freedom
for things to go wrong.  Very experienced people can usually (but not always)
get away with changing 2 or three things at once but as a beginner, you can't.
Which leads to the next rule.
<p>
When you're beginning, learn from those who've been there before you. IN this
case, listen to the experts on this list and start your project with a basic
design that works.  Once you get the laser working and get a feel for how it
tunes and how tolerant it is to parameter change, then you can begin to
experiment.
<p>
If you don't follow these well-proven procedures, you're going to end up with
a pile of stuff that does not lase and you will become frustrated enough to
quit.  Frustration in a hobby is not fun.  Follow the advice of the experts -
at least until you have something that works!

<h3><A NAME="cc2tcex">Tim's Comments on Experimenting with a CO2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Tim Walters (trwalters@my-deja.com).)

The first thing to do when you're experimenting with a CO2 laser is:
<p>
WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!
<p>
It was a slow-flow axial system. I put a 150 lpm vacuum pump on one end and
admitted pre-mix laser gas (rented cylinder & regulator) at the other end. I
monitored tube vacuum with a closed-end manometer (I made it out of a piece of
glass tubing and some mercury). Adjust your laser gas flow until you get about
20 Torr (20 mm of mercury) in the tube.  WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!  Hit it with the
high voltage and don't be standing in front of it! It had a copper rear mirror
and a zinc selenide output coupler. CO2 puts out about 100 watts per meter of
bore length (mine was a meter long and measured 100 watts). I didn't use any
fancy bellows on the ends. You can place o-rings between the optics and the
machined tube ends with 3-point adjust screws, and it works just fine.  100
watts of 10.6 micron infrared will do SERIOUS DAMAGE.  WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!
You can EASILY set things on fire dozens of yards away. Like the wall of your
house. Or the wall of your neighbors house. Or your clothes.. If you focus the
beam (mine was 3/8" in diameter at the output coupler) to a point on a fire
brick, it looks like a welding arc.  WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!
<p>
The way I aligned/tuned it was:
<p>
WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!

<ol>
<li>Get an initial alignment with a small HeNe laser.
<li>Apply power.
<li>Put a piece of tissue paper in the beam path.
<li>Tune for maximum smoke.
<li>Replace tissue with wood.
<li>Tune for maximum smoke.
<li>Replace wood with fire brick.
<li>Tune for maximum brightness of the red-hot spot on the brick...
</ol>

WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!
<p>
Get the point on safety glasses??  10.6 micron radiation will completely ruin
the surface of your eyeball PERMANENTLY!!  Try this: focus the beam down onto
a small dish of water. The water will boil AT THE SURFACE. So will your
eyeball!

(From: LaserguruChris (laserguruchris@aol.com).)
<p>
While it may be possible to build a sealed tube CO2 laser from scratch, it
would be VERY difficult because special equipment and gas mixtures are
required.  Check out
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/knapp/sealco2.htm">David Knapp's Sealed
CO2 Laser Page</A>.  (This is the only example I know of for a non-commercial
sealed tube CO2 laser. --- Sam)
<p>
On the other hand you can "build" one much like you build a computer or a HeNe
laser. Purchase the tube and build or buy a power supply. You have two types of
tubes to choose from: RF excited or DC excited. It is the DC tubes you would be
interested if you wanted to build a power supply. This is because RF power
supplies are a pain to tweak into playing fairly with your head unless it is
part of an already working system.  And, the cost of components can be
quite high - Over $200 each for 150 W or better GaAs RF power transistors in
quantity and power RF vacuum tubes that are even more costly.
DC excited CO2 laser tubes are happy as long as you keep them cool, keep the
current within operating range, and don't reverse the polarity. Both of these
kinds of sealed laser tubes use a special gas mixture and a catalytic reformer
to repair the laser gas damaged by the discharge. Without a special gas
mixture and catalytic reformer, a sealed tube of regular CO2 gas mixture
would operate for merely a few seconds before ceasing to lase.  Both of these
types of tubes (and power supplies!) can sometimes be found at eBay for a
reasonable price.
<p>
The difference between slow and fast flow is not necessarilly how long the gas
lasts, but just what it sounds like - how fast the gas is moving through the
tube.  In slow flow lasers the gas is moving through the tube slowly and is
being cooled through the tube wall.  This is common in lower power range CO2
lasers up to a kW max or so. These types of lasers are generally open loop
systems but the higher power type generally have a gas recycler to regenerate
the gas damaged by the discharge. In fast flow lasers the gas is heated by the
electric discharge so fast it must be blown out of the tube quickly before it
gets hot enough to kill lasing. The gas flow is generally faster then the
speed of sound in air, being moved by special pumps called roots blowers. The
gas is then actively cooled by a heat exchanger and regenerated by a catalytic
reformer.

<h2>Alternatives to Constructing a CO2 Laser from Scratch</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2g">For the Lazy at Heart - Almost Everything You Need -
 Oops, Too Late</A></h3>

While constructing the entire CO2 laser from scratch should be your goal,
gaining access to at least the glasswork part of one used or from scrap could
at least get you half-way.  Of course, obtaining a sealed CO2 laser tube -
available new and used from a variety of sources - is really no more fun than
getting a cheap HeNe tube.  All you then need is a suitable power supply (not
much different than a scaled-up HeNe power supply) and cooling - very boring as
far as laser construction projects go.  See the chapter:
<A HREF="laserco2.htm#co2toc">Carbon (CO2) Dioxide Lasers</A> for more info.
<p>
However, with a flowing gas CO2 laser head, you at least have to deal with the
vacuum and gas supply issues in addition to the power supply and cooling.  The
glasswork is done for you and even the optics are likely contained as part of
the laser head assembly.  You can still experiment with various gas mixtures
and operating pressures, and possibly optics as well if they are removable.
<p>
The following postings appeared recently on the USENET newsgroup

<ul>
<li><b>For Sale 1</b>: Sharplan flowing gas CO2 head with resonator and optics,
removed from medical service.  Has external mirrors, Pyrex tube with cooling
jacket and intracavity windows, tube mounts, overtemp switch and resonator.
The scientific grade resonator has 3/16-100 thread adjustment micrometers for
mirror X-Y adjustments on both ends. ZeSe output coupler, some sort of silicon
rear mirror.  Some notes penciled on the unit have the reccommended pressure
and current ranges for use from 0 to 15 watts (15 to 20 Torr) and 16 to 50
watts (25 Torr).  Just add a pump, water flow, neon sign transformer and the
gas mix, and you're lasing.  The unit was removed from service when the PSU
blew up.
<p>
The tube has at least a half inch bore diameter.  Length between electrodes is
23 inches and between mirrors is 31 inches.  The intracavity windows are
attached to the tube with Torr Seal and are very nicely sealed in a dust-proof
cavity with O-rings. The tube is one piece, the jacket is glassed into the
tube. I filled the jacket with water and found no leaks. The head has walls of
3/8ths aluminum and the resonator machining quality is much better then what I
find on the $40,000 dollar argon ion lasers I work on. If you are trying to
build a CO2, this would save you much time and effort.

<h3><A NAME="cc2seal">Home-Built CO2 Laser using Commercial Sealed Plasma
 Tube</A></h3>

Another even simpler (though probably expensive on a dollar/watt basis at
least) alternative is to use a commercial CO2 plasma tube.  Smaller versions of
these (perhaps 1 to 20 W output) look like fat helium-neon laser tubes and
power supply requirements are similar (though operating and start voltages are
generally much higher and the required ballast resistance is also greater).
A power supply similar to the ones shown for the truly home-built CO2 laser
could be constructed relatively easily (but it would have to be DC).
<p>
Since sealed CO2 plasma tubes aren't nearly as common as their HeNe cousins,
the tube cost is likely to be substantial as supplier options are limited.  In
addition, maximum power output is relatively low compared to what can be built
from scratch or with a commercial laser head using a flowing gas design.
However, the cost savings of not requiring a vacuum and gas supply system as
well as the gas itself must be factored into the total expenses.
<p>
Larger sealed tubes - up to 500 W or more - are available but finding one of
these in working condition at an affordable price would be very rare.  And,
their power requirements may be quite exotic compared to what the smaller
ones expect (though not all).
<p>
However, these sorts of tubes do sometimes turn up on surplus and auction
sites so if you really want a CO2 without the support system hassle, this may
be worth considering.  Just be sure you get a money back warranty that the
tube works or insist on some means of testing it before buying - refilling or
repair would not be cheap for any of these.
<p>
(From: Wayne Verish (WVerish@aol.com).)
<p>
I built a CO2 laser using a commercial sealed 5 watt CO2 laser tube.  The  
power supply consists of a Variac driving a 9 kV neon sign transformer with
four 15 kV rectifiers (without filtering).  The start voltage is 9 kV and the
laser runs fine at 6 to 7 mA.  Cooling is via a small pond pump that
circulates 2 liters/minute (1 liter is acceptable).
<p>
(From: Kevin (kdschultz11789@yahoo.com).)
<p>
In my old lab we used a GTE Line Lite 950, which was originally a
sealed tube, but modified by my lab to allow us to fill the tube
ourselves. These modifications were made before I got there, but my
impression was that the lasers were refilled on a time scale of 1-2
months. While I was there, we pumped out the laser every morning and
filled the tube to a pressure of about 20 torr. The gas mix that we
used was by volume 23% CO2, 0.019% H2, 10.2% N2, 2.30% Xe and the rest He.
Our lab had a book "The CO2 laser" by W. Wittman and published by
Springer-Verlag that had a good description of the roles of each of
these gases, although our edition had quite a few typos.

<h3><A NAME="cc2cc2h">Why You Should Avoid the Temptation to Buy a Cheap Used
 CO2 Laser</A></h3>

If you want a CO2 laser solely for the purpose of wood burning or something
like that, by all means find a used unit (they go for perhaps $500 to $2,000
depending on size, age, and condition) and repair it if necessary (if
possible).  However, if your objective is to build a laser from scratch, this
is, well, cheating! :)
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)  
<p>
I'm a former teacher.  Selling you a unit is in my view depriving you of a
valuable lesson or two.  You could build a better unit for the cost of
shipping one of these across the country.  The types of used medical CO2 lasers
that are available are heavy.   If you can beat these arguments in private
email and have failed in a attempt to construct one, I'll think about it some
time down the road.   The CO2 laser is not beyond a student's reach to
construct.  Perhaps the more important part of the experience is getting out
and meeting people.  Many companies will help you with the materials budget,
they either believe in education or know you'll probably end up being a
potential customer after college.  Some will look at you as a potential
part-time employee in the process.  Get out there and try first. :-)
<p>
Besides, your money is probably hard earned, selling you a known dying unit
would be unethical.  I agree there might be parts for you as a young person
that are made from pure unobtainium.  When you get to that point I or someone
else will try to help you out.

<h2>Home-Built Transverse Excited Atmospheric CO2 Lasers</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cc2tea0">What About a Home-Built TEA CO2 Laser?</A></h3>

Most high power (kWs) CO2 lasers are constructed using TEA (Transverse Excited
Atmospheric) designs.  Rather than having a long tube with a electrical
discharge along its length and the CO2 gas mixture flowing from end to end,
a series of electrodes and gas inlets are spaced along the tube.  In this
manner, higher pressures can be used since the electrical discharge doesn't
need to go the full length of the tube - only across it.  And, fresh gas can
flow to all parts of the tube and doesn't get depleted along the way.
<p>
Strictly speaking, TEA means operation at atmospheric pressure (though you
can still have a transverse excited laser without and 'A' part as described
below).  However, above about 100 Torr, it isn't practical to maintain a stable
discharge (reference: The Laser Guide Book by Jeff Hechtso, page 136).  Thus,
TEA lasers are operated in pulsed mode.  But, if the pulse repetition rate is
high enough, then for all practical purposes for most applications, it is
effectively CW.  The high peak power is often used to advantage in materials
processing like cutting and drilling.
<p>
In the diagram below, the gas feed and return system would be conceptually
similar to the power supply with individual capillaries or metering valves
acting as ballast resistors for each nozzle. :)  The tube walls between the
anodes and cathodes would need to be nonconducting with the gas feed nozzles
(attached to the ballast resistors) being made of metal and doing double duty
as the anodes.  The entire opposite side of the tube could be metallic and
serve as the cathode.  Since it is not near the mirrors, sputtering shouldn't
be a major problem.  Either sir or water cooling could be used.
<p>
This applies directly to a low pressure ('TE') CO2 laser operating below 100
Torr.  For pulsed excitation at higher pressures, a different sort of pulse
distribution network would be required.

For a home-built TEA CO2 laser, each electrode is going to have to sustain a
current on the order of the 30 to 100 mA for the axial flow laser (AFL) but at
somewhat lower voltage to maintain the same discharge current density.  So,
you will need some way of distributing power (and gas) among perhaps several
dozen electrodes and inlet tubes.  This will require separate power supply
feeds via individual ballast resistors.  The gas can be similarly apportioned
using capillary metering lines or something similar.
<p>
However, some percentage of the power will be wasted because unlike the AFL
approach, not all of the tube bore is being used in lasing.  The discharge
won't be as uniform as the with AFL either.  Thus, for the same power input,
the efficiency of a small TEA design may be worse than for an AFL laser.  At
some level of power output, the TEA laser will have clear advantages.  I don't
know whether this point can be realistically reached for a home-built system.
<p>

If you're thinking about building a TEA laser, make sure you are well versed
in high voltage circuits, and the dangers that they can pose.  It's not fun
watching a high voltage thyratron (it's been three years, I think that's what
the item was) short out and throw glowing hot metal fragments at your head.
Start small.  The small TEA laser I worked with would output about 30
millijoules per pulse and was about a foot long and eight inches high,
including all the electronics.  
<p>
(From: Jeff Zurkow (jeff@atrox.com).)
<p>
A large TEA (pulsed) CO2 laser is described by Seguin, Manes and Tulip in the
paper: "Simple Inexpensive Laboratory-Quality Rogowski TEA Laser", Review
of Scientific Instruments 43:8, August 1972, pp. 1134-1139.  It's very
impressive (6' long), and looks pretty straightforward to build (except for
requiring a 50 kV, 16 mA power supply).
<p>
It's a monster, roughly ten feet long.  The Rogowski electrodes were machined
(using a custom-made milling cutter) from aluminum bar 4" x 3/4" x 6' (in 2
foot sections).  They're housed in a piece of 5.6" (14 cm OD x 13 cm ID)
acrylic pipe. Preionization is provided by two lengths of fine tungsten wire,
mounted on standoffs from the sides of the pipe and running the length of the
electrodes.
<p>
The whole thing is mounted on a piece of aluminum channel, 3.2" x 10" x
10 feet, with short optical benches let into the ends and extending out a
foot or two.  The channel houses an oil-filled acrylic tank, 6 feet long
(10 x 20 x 180 cm), containing the main capacitors. Firing relies on a
triggered spark gap, driven by an automotive ignition coil, which in
turn is driven by a UJT/SCR circuit. There's some talk of germanium
output couplers and NaCl lenses; I guess ZnSe optics weren't readiliy
available in 1972.
<p>
The authors report an estimated pulse energy of greater than 15 J in a
100 ns pulse with a peak power of about 100 MW. They state: "Accurate
measurement of pulse energy was difficult since the laser energy produced
a plasma in the thermopile used.". :)
<p>
In re-reading the paper, I notice that they report having built several
lasers of similar design, including a smaller, 20 cm unit. They suggest
that the design is uncritical, and can be scaled down (or up!) for
convenience. Interestingly enough, the final paragraph reads: "Researchers
wishing to fabricate an equally simple and inexpensive standard CO2 laser for
additional or complementary investigations are referred to the publication in
Scientific American on a low cost CO2 laser.".

<h3><A NAME="cc2tea1">Discussion of Home-Built TEA CO2 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Robin Stoddart (stoddart@interlog.com).)
<p>
I was just having a brain thunder storm, and I came up with an idea. I was
thinking that instead of having the electrodes at the ends, why not have a
TEA configuration, but just have continuous wave output. The tube would be a
long box - two sides being plates of some sort of glass or ceramic, and the
other two sides being long metal plates (electrodes). One could put holes
into the electrodes - along the optical axis, and get high flow - cool gas,
and very pure.. I guess there might be a problem of some sort  of Jacob's
ladder effect, but who knows?
<p>
(From: Terry Greene (xray@cstel.net).)
<p>
TEA stands for "Transversely Excited Atmospheric" pressure. The fact that they
are pulsed is a result of the discharge characteristics of the gas at
atmosphere. Again, keep in mind that at high rep rates it will cut just like
CW so it might as well be CW. The low pressure system you were debating would
allow transverse CW operation, but it wouldn't produce near the average power
output as it would pulsed at atmosphere. 
<p>
TEA is usually done with the gas flowing at 90 degrees to the electrodes.  A
real TEA, by definition of course, operates at atmospheric pressure. I have no
reason to doubt that you could build and make the system you describe
functional, but the design will change the input requirements. 
<ul>
<li>Voltage requirements are dictated by gas mix, pressure and length of
   discharge. The discharge length will be quite short compared to an axial
   flow which will reduce the voltage required considerably.   
<p>
<li>Remember that the active medium will require a given current density
   along the length of the bore. With an axial flow the same electrons
   travel the length of the bore which keeps the number of electrons
   (current) required down to achieve the target current density. A
   transversely exited arrangement will naturally require a LOT input more
   current to produce the same current density down the length of the bore.
   Typical trade off in electronics. To get the same power with lower
   voltage you must have higher current.
</ul>
The bright side of the arrangement is that if you've got a vacuum pump big
enough to handle it, the bore is cleared of gas much more quickly you should
be able to crank the amperage and get more output. BUT, if you are going to go
to this much trouble why not forget the vacuum pump, run it at atmosphere with
a 50kV supply (high gas pressure requires much higher voltage as per Paschens
Law) and make some SERIOUS output.
<p>
And BTW, the holy grail Synrad lasers everybody wants are slab sided pulsed DC
and RF driven, very much like your TEA design only sealed off.  
<p>
(From: Bob.)
<p>
Ok, from what I know, all CO2 TEA lasers operate just as an excimer laser does.
In fact I have seen a bunch of excimers advertised as being able to take CO2.
The electrodes are two parallel plates spaced about 2 cm apart, 3 cm wide, and
50 cm long. The maximum voltage across the gap is about 35 kV. It's pulsed and
runs at about a maximum of 80 Hz. From this, almost 30 W are extracted at the
UV excimer lines, I'm not sure exactly what that converts to with CO2, but
intuitively I would imagine we are talking about a joule per pulse or so. The
gas transport design is complex, but this is only to preserve the expensive
excimer gas mix (Ne and Xe among others.) and some of it wouldn't be needed
with cheap CO2 mix.  There is basically a large box that acts as a
vacuum-pressure vessel inside of which is the electrode assembly, and there
is a squirrel-cage fan that blows the gas through the discharge region, and
finally over some water cooled heat sinks.  You could simply exhaust the gas
to avoid the complicated mechanical feedthrough seals in the squirrel cage (the
motor is located outside the chamber). all this information was gleaned from
looking over a 2000 series Questek excimer.
<p>
A pulsed beam actually works better for most applications of CO2 lasers.  While
they might have the same average power as a CW beam, since they are pulsed, the
peak power is much higher than the CW beam. The reason you don't see a lot of
TEA's with such a simple gas flow design (i.e. muffin fans) is that most are
modeled after excimer lasers. Chlorine and/or fluorine gas is not something
you want near most objects, especially for extended periods of time. That is
the reason for all the fancy set up in most excimers.
<p>
And, BTW, it isn't quite accurate to say no vacuum is needed.  You would still
have to initially evacuate the chamber before filling it with the laser gas
mix. Plexiglas construction of the laser chamber is certainly a viable option.
The main electrodes must be very smooth and precisely spaced to prevent arcing
in a particular spot and should be shaped accordingly. Aluminum foil would not
likely be the best candidate for this application and electrodes machined from
aluminum stock would be preferred. The laser chamber should be built to
withstand some pressure rather than to maintain a vacuum, as with most other
types of lasers. Operating the laser at a higher than atmospheric pressure
will yield higher output pulses. The main difficulties in the operation of
this laser are the switching of the very high voltage pulses (~40,000 volts)
supplied by the capacitors and the pre-ionizing of the laser channel gases
just prior to the main pulse to maintain an even discharge throughout the
chamber.  Search for "TEA CO2" in a patent database and check out some
commercial designs.

<h3><A NAME="cc2tea2">Power for that Really BIG Laser</A></h3>

(From: Terry Greene (xray@cstel.net).)
<p>
Old X-ray units are adjustable from 50 to 125 kV at 300 to 1000 mA. Large TEAs
require (from the limited tech data that I've been able to acquire) around 50
kV. Since they operate in a pulsed mode the current available will simply
dictate the rep rate as that will determine how long it takes to charge the
wave shaping network. Almost everything you will need to supply a TEA is
already in the unit. Only thing I can think of that's not in there would be
the caps for the wave shaper. I've got two old commercially useless units
sitting here. Just had a friend in Atlanta send half a dozen to the dump. My
point is that old x-ray units can be had for free if you know where to look.
The only problem is they are large and heavy. The control will typically weigh
150 to 200 pounds and the transformer will weigh 300 to 500 pounds. You can
move them with no problem with a refrigeration hand truck, but it will have to
be shipped by truck. This can get a bit expensive.
<p>
WARNING: Even the smallest of these are more than just very slightly DEADLY.
If run unloaded, the output voltage can double on one of these things. They
can kill you stone dead from six inches away under the right circumstances.
Not only do you not have to touch it, you don't have to be all that close to
it. Be REAL careful with this stuff if you pick one up. :-)

<h3><A NAME="cc2big1">And If That's Not BIG Enough</A></h3>

This is what happens when you have to much time on your hands.  But I
submit this for peer review and the question: "Will it work?" if so:
"Will I be able to get more than one shot out of it?".
<p>
Find a PVC pipe 20 feet long and 12 inches in diameter. Cut the ends
totally parallel to each other. Glue a polished copper disk on one end
and a disk with a 3 inch hole on the other. Make sure these disks are
aligned with a laser pointer or something.  Melt some salt so when it
cools it looks like a 4 inch dish about an inch thick and glue it onto
the hole. Attach your bolt style electrodes into the cavity. So the
whole thing looks like a regular laser but bigger. Pump out the air and
backfill with CO2 laser gas at 100 to 400 Torr.  Hoist this thing on top
of tree. You have one electrode at ground and the other has magnet
wire.  The end of this magnet wire goes to an Estes rocket or something.
When a storm comes around and the lightning is close, you know what to
do!  I read that a lightning strike contains over a billion joules of
energy!! just multiply that by the standard CO2 conversion efficiency
of 20% and you got yourself a laser that can make Startrek captains
drool.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
It might sort of work once.  However, aside from any magnet wire thin enough to
be dangled behind a hobby rocket being able to carry a million Amps for more
than a microsecond, there is only so much lasing energy that can be extracted
from a finite volume of gas before the entire thing explodes.  The wire
won't be a problem for that one shot though since the copper vapor will
carry the current just fine. :)

<h3><A NAME="cc2tlmb">The TEA CO2 Laser That Might Have Been</A></h3>

I don't really know whether the "Rube Goldberg" or "Frankenstein" laser
described below ever actually worked.  It sounds like it could have operated
as a sort of Transverse Excited Atmospheric (TEA) CO2 laser for the brief
instant of its existence.  However, I'm willing to believe it - strange things
are possible!  The CO2 laser is quite forgiving: Get a reasonable mix of CO2
and other gases in an excited state between mirrors and lasing action is
likely!  Too bad it self destructed upon "First Light". :(
<p>
(From: Ocean House (offset@cci-yuccavalley.com).)
<p>
I first learned that it was possible to build a laser with my very own hands,
the thought of which seemed to open up new things for me to explore. Lasers
were always something that I had only seen on TV and in movies, and always
depicted as a device of "Rocket Science", and associated with hundreds of
thousands of dollars expense.
<p>
Until one day, a family friend of whom I had known since I was a small child
started talking to me about lasers.  He explained to me the basics of how a
gas laser worked and told me about all of the failed attempts that he had with
only one short lived success, using a laser head that he had constructed using
crude mirrors from cameras, lots of Epoxy, a steel tube, 2 spark plugs, a gas
port with Freon valve, various plastic parts, silicone rubber slabs made by
taking 2 sheets of glass and engine seal glued together to form a sheet, a BB
gun CO2 cartridge, a 100 amp DC arc welder, 4 kV electronic driven neon
transformer, a single 300 amp diode found for pennys in a scrap yard, and an
intake manifold connection to his doge truck for gas charging. Of course, even
being brand new to the theory of lasers, I could see many readily apparent
flaws in the design, but that didn't matter as he had achieved a brief "First
Light" that caused the metal film one of the mirrors to vaporize and lase
themselves in a brilliant white flash with all the power originating from
simple spark plug electrodes, to burn a significant hole in the wall!  And all
he had to spend was 10 bucks everything he needed was laying around. He
offered to give it to me and I gladly accepted.
<p>
Examining it at first glance I almost wanted to say to him you have to be
kidding me, it looked like a rusted hunk of junk with screws sticking out of
Epoxy and a course screen from a spice bottle used as a sealing support behind
the back mirror covered in Epoxy. The mirrors where crudely aimed and
everything I learned from looking at its construction compared to the theory
he had explained to me was showed it was severely lacking in the enginering
department, but still barely within the tolerances of the theory to allow such
a lasing event. Even with a significant amount of air present, it still lased
until breakdown.  The only way that i can explain this is that the electrical
discharge caused the O2 and N to form NO2 gas which combined with the trace
water to form HNO3 (nitric acid) leaving only the CO2 and the other noble
gases and some free N atoms to lase very inefficiently, but compensated by
having the high current low voltage DC interduced, forming sort of a multi-gas
laser.  He was starting it by running the HV to ground and with a gate diode
in series, tapping it to the first series spark plug. This worked because the
HV running while he was preparing the arc welder performed the breakdown of
the nitrogen and oxygen and by the time he had struck the DC to the circuit.
It worked for a split second distorying the electrodes and the front mirror
only to leave its mark on the wall in front of it!

These would appear to be similar in construction to the flowing gas CO2 laser
although everything (except the power output) is much LARGER!  The 200 to 400
GHz range of frequencies mentioned below is correspond to wavelengths of 1.5
to .75 millimeters.

A friend of mine built and operated a H2O and a HCN laser at the physics
department of the University of Hamburg, Germany. I don't remember the
wavelength, but these devices ran in the very far IR range, somewhere in the
200 to 400 GHz range, far away from CO2 lasers. Both the H2O and HCN lasers
used a Pyrex discharge tube with about 2" diameter and about 10 feet length,
with a water jacket for cooling. They ran at about 5 kV with several amps
discharge current and produced a few mW. Internal solid copper mirrors formed
a plano-convex resonator with a small central hole as the output coupler on
one side. The resonator used thermally isolated Invar-rods to maintain a
stable distance between the mirrors. The cavity-length required adjustment to
find the right longitudinal mode, which also allowed for some frequency
tuning.  These lasers were of the continuous flow type: vacuum pump on one
side and a isothermal water reservoir followed by a needle valve on the other
side of the discharge column.

These are very large, power hungry devices of interest only to researchers who
need a source EM radiation a tad above millimeter waves.

<h3><A NAME="cc2gdy">How About a Home-Built Gas Dynamic CO2 Laser"</A>

Hey, all you need to do is fire up that old Atlas rocket engine sitting in your
garage with some used CO2 laser mirrors in a resonator configuration beyond
its exhaust pipe and - Voila! Instant high power laser.  Hope your home
insurance is paid up. :)
<p>
OK, so perhaps the full blown version isn't realistic.  I wonder if something
less ambitious could be done using propane heater or something?
