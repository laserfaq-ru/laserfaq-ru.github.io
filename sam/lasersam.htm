<h2>Welcome to Sam's Laser FAQ!</h2>
<p>
This collection of documents, called "Sam's Laser FAQ", has a great deal of
practical information on a variety of laser related topics.  If you are already
familiar with its scope, purpose, and general organization, you can go directly
to <A HREF="laserfaq.htm#faqtoc">Sam's Laser FAQ Table of Contents</A>.
However, if this is your first visit - or you have been away for awhile -
check out the summary and version update info below.
<p>
Sam's Laser FAQ provides a wealth of useful (not just textbook) information on
many types of lasers of interest to the experimenter and hobbyist:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Basic laser principles, laser safety, general laser information, laser
 instruments and applications, laser and parts sources, laser discussion groups
 and newsgroups, and many references, and links.  There is even a list of
 laser experiments and projects. (The descriptions are somewhat sparse at the
 moment but there are also links to other related Web sites.)
<p>
<li>Diode, Helium-Neon (HeNe), Argon/Krypton (Ar/Kr) Ion, Carbon Dioxide (CO2),
 Helium-Cadmium (HeCd), and Pulsed and Diode Pumped Solid State (SS) laser
 characteristics, drive requirements, and power supply design considerations.
 Schematics for at least <b>25</b> diode laser drivers, <b>40</b> complete
 HeNe laser power supplies, <b>6</b> complete Ar/Kr ion laser power supplies,
 and <b>6</b> pulsed SS laser power supplies, as well as many other support
 circuits like regulators and modulators.
<p>
<li>Operation, internal construction (optical and electrical), adjustment,
 and repair of a variety of commercial lasers of all types including Coherent,
 Melles Griot, Spectra-Physics, Uniphase, and others.  The detailed
 information on some lasers including the Coherent 532 and Compass-M,
 Lightwave 142 and 221, Melles Griot 05-GSD-309, and Uniphase uGreen,
 cannot be obtained from any other publicly accessible source on-line
 or in print.
<p>
<li>Amateur laser construction (building lasers from raw materials rather than
 from laser components).  Extensive material on getting started in this
 exciting and challenging pastime (often a great deal of time!) as well as
 complete descriptions - with diagrams - of the home-built lasers from the
 Scientific American "Amateur Scientist" columns (and the collection "Light
 and its Uses") and other sources.
</ul>
<p>
Sam's Laser FAQ was developed to provide a unique resource for experimenters
and hobbyists - as well as just plain old basement tinkerers.  To the best of
my knowledge, nothing as comprehensive has ever been available anywhere else
in the explored universe (and almost certainly beyond) either on-line or in
print.
<p>
If this was what you were looking for, your search is over! :-)

<h2>A Word About These Pages</h2>

Sam's Laser FAQ is declared to be a fluff-free zone!  There will be no
unnecessary, superfluous, or useless graphics of any kind - including but
not limited to: dancing, gyrating, or other animated icons, colored textured
backgrounds that are impossible to read through, or forced downloading of
bit intense pictures that may be of no interest to you.  Nor, will I ever
expect you to use a particular brand of Web browser to be able to effectively
access these pages.  There are and never will be any advertisements, cookies,
or other impositions on your time and space.  In the time that it may take
wading through a single monstrosity of the professional Web page designers
at other sites, you will be able to find out what you want to know, when
you want to know it!  What a concept. :-)  (Note, however, that your browser
needs to be configured properly to make sense of the many ASCII diagrams,
schematics, and tables.  See the document: <A HREF="browset.htm">Suggested
Browser Settings</A> for font and other related information.)
<p>
In return for this gold mine of information, please make a serious effort to
find the answers to your questions before contacting me.  It may take just a
wee bit of effort and could stress a few neurons in the process, but there is
an excellent chance that what you seek is covered here.  Should you be really
stuck - or just want to discuss lasers, I will respond to email in a timely
manner.  However, if your questions indicate that you haven't even gotten past
the Welcome Page, AND I am in a good mood, you will get a somewhat polite
reply to read the appropriate chapter(s) of the FAQ.  On the other hand, if it
is a bad day, and you are really really lucky, you will probably be ignored.
Don't get me wrong - I enjoy discussing lasers with laser enthusiasts and
novices alike, and will be happy to do so at almost any hour of the day or
night.  However, if you're seeking some basic information, I would really
really appreciate it if you do at least a bit of your homework first.  In
any case, if you do email me, I expect to be able to hit the reply key for
my mail program and not get bounced email.  I will not attempt to unjumble
any anti-SPAM email addresses!  I have posted over 20,000 articles to the
USENET newsgroups using my true email address.  And, you won't pick up SPAM
via my private email anyhow.  Even computer viruses avoid my address book since
it's on a unix system!)  Yes, SPAM is a pain but I tolerate the small amount
I get resulting from postings so others will not be inconvenienced.
<p>
However, due to the increasing amount of SPAM via repairfaq.org email
addresses, I have decided to require all initial email contact from the
FAQs to be via the Feedback Form on the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.  (At some point my repairfaq.org email address will
cease to function.)  Any reply from me will have a valid email address to
use for future correspondance.  My apologies but I've already made so
many millions from all those get rich quick schemes that I've run out of
places to put it all. :)
<p>
Note: I NEVER send email attachments.  If you receive a message supposedly from
one of my addresses with any sort of attachment, it is bogus and possibly a
virus - someone's address book includes my address and their computer is
infected.  Send me the complete headers and I'll attempt to check it out just
hit the delete key.

<h2>A Somewhat Polite Gripe About Professional Web Sites</h2>

One of the most time consuming and annoying parts of maintaining the
Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ and Sam's Laser FAQ is attempting to keep
the outside links up to date.
Why does it seem that most professional Web site
designers are programmed by their genes to rework the directory structure of
their Web sites every 26 microseconds???  Isn't this totally counterproductive
from a business point of view?  Links that people have painstakingly set up
stop working with "Error 404" or "Server not Found" and no hint of where
they went or often if the company even still exists.  So countless
person millenia are wasted attempting to relocate them?
How many just give up and take their business elsewhere?
Does it really make sense to annoy your customers?
<p>
Granted, personal Web sites that move from one ISP to another due to lower
costs or whatever may not have the luxury of being able to retain forwarding
links.  But businesses and organizations should not have this issue.
<p>
In all fairness, there are a few - but very few compared to what's out there -
who do either provide direct forwarding links, or at least attempt to redirect
to an appropriate Web page.  But the vast majority would seem to take the
attitude that the Web site is there to show off the skills of the Web site
designer, and not for the users of the information.  But perhaps there is some
hope for it seems that the older a Web site is, the more likely it will be
to maintain its structure in the future.

<h2>Navigating Sam's Laser FAQ</h2>

Under ideal conditions, the entire 8+ MB text of Sam's Laser FAQ would be in a
single file and your access to it would be via a 100 GB/s link.  In a few
years, such capabilities may appear primitive but for now, one can only dream
of avoiding the World Wide Wait. :)  Therefore, the organization of these
pages ends up being a compromise.  If you have the space, installing a local
copy of Sam's Laser FAQ on a reasonably fast computer would be best (though you
lose out on automatic updates).  See: <A HREF="laserins.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ
Local Installation</A> for details.
<p>
Sam's Laser FAQ is divided into <b>chapters</b> and <b>sections</b>.  Except
for the introductory material including the Table of Contents (ToC),
each chapter is a separate file and has its own <b>Sub-Table of Contents</b>
(Sub-ToC) Anything smaller than a chapter is called a section and has its own
header and link from the chapter's Sub-ToC.  Multiple sections may be grouped
where they are related to one topic or related topics.  For the most part,
there are no nested text files.  With one or two possible exceptions, the
only files below the text files are those for diagrams and photos.  To
minimize download time, there are no in-line graphics anywhere except the
Laser Equipment Gallery where relaxation is encouraged. :)
<p>
Links to return to the ToC are located at the beginning of every chapter
and links to return to its Sub-ToC (top of page) are located at the end
of the chapter as well as between major sections.  There is also a link at
the end of every chapter to the next chapter.
<p>
Hyperlinks within the text will either be to other chapters or sections of
Sam's Laser FAQ (in which case they will generally be preceded with "chapter:"
or "section:" as appropriate) or to other pages on this Web site or elsewhere.
All local links have complete URLs including the filename so it is possible to
tell if the link is to some other page (if the filename doesn't match the one
currently being read).
<p>
All of Sam's Laser FAQ uses the very simplest HTML.  This is partly because I
have to maintain it and partly to avoid fluff. :)  I have thought about adding
a framed entry point which would include the ToC(s) down the left edge and
would be interested in any opinions you may have on this and other formatting
issues.
<p>
I realize that a fast search facility would be really nice.  Eventually, I
may have one (I refuse to use free search engines that impose advertising.
They tend to be too slow anyhow.)  In the meantime, realize that you can
always use Ctrl-F in your browser to search any single document.  The two
special files: <A HREF="laserfil.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ Expanded ToC</A> and
<a href="lasertoc.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ Comprehensive Table of Contents</A>
provide a means of using this technique to find desired topics with a minimum
of effort.  You can also use the search engine on the
<A HREF="http://repairfaq.ece.drexel.edu/">Drexel S.E.R FAQ Mirror Site</A>.
However, if someone would offer to provide a fast non-commercial
search engine that I can just drop in with near zero effort, please contact me
me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.

<h2>Sam's Laser FAQ Sites</h2>

Check out the <A HREF="samsites.htm">Home and Mirror Site Locations</A> page
for a list of places to find Sam's Laser FAQ (as well as the complete
Sci.Electronics.Repair (S.E.R) FAQ and Silicon Sam's Technology Resource
(SSTR).  There, you will also find Links to ZIP files with the latest version
of the complete Sam's Laser FAQ and SSTR.
<p>
The mirror sites (no pun intended...  OK, well maybe just a little
one-sided one) will always maintain a reasonably current version of this
document.  Check the individual sites for the latest version and specific
viewing and download options and try to use the site nearest you to minimize
Web traffic!
<p>
There is also an early version (even predates the name "Sam's Laser FAQ") at
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/3931/">The Laser Resource
Library</A> which is quite ancient (and ugly) at this point.  I have no plans
to update it mainly because I have lost the password and become disgusted with
the annoying advertising imposed by the operators of that site at the time
I lost the password. :-)  Or, go to
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/slfarchv/">Sam's Laser FAQ Archive</A>
for this and a couple other antiques.
<p>
We are always looking for contributions (of all types) in any and all laser
related areas to expand the content of these sites.

<h2>Request for Computer Resources in Support of Sam's Laser FAQ Development</h2>

<h3><A NAME="scpwtacr">Computer Resources for FAQ Development</a></h3>

Most of the text/html content for the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ and Sam's
Laser FAQ is developed in emacs on a unix system via telnet/ssh.
While some people may consider such an arrangement archaic, this allows for
rapid creation and editing, accessibility to the original files from anywhere
in the Universe via an Internet connection, less need to upload or download
files to my PC, and professionally managed system maintenance, upgrades, and
backup.
<p>
I currently have access to accounts at the University of Pennsylvania
(UPenn) and Drexel University which I use to create, edit, and test
the material in the Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ and Sam's Laser FAQ.
The primary account I use for FAQ development is at UPenn and this
seems to be secure for the moment the situation can change from one
year to the next.  The Drexel computer is probably
reliable as far as a long term relationship but for some reason,
USENET access is limited and posting doesn't seem to work at all.
<p>
Therefore, I am looking for access to 1 or 2 additional unix or linux
systems, preferably at academic institutions like colleges or
universities, but I will also consider other types of not-for-profit
organizations.  For obvious reasons, I really do not want to do this in
association with anything commercial. My needs are modest: 1 GB of
disk space, telnet or ssh, ftp or sftp, emacs/gnus read/post,
muttmail, and publicly accessible Web space.  Most of what I do is
editing and email so processing requirements are modest and shouldn't
impact other activities.  However, a reliable supported environment is
critical to my sanity so your personal server farm isn't something of
much interest. :)
<p>
I do not want and will not accept monetary contributions for this effort.
But, a way to help the FAQ development would be to provide stable
computer access.  If you know of, or are able to offer such a resource,
please contact me via the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair
FAQ Email Links Page.</A>  In return, of course, you get a local copy of
the absolutely latest and greatest versions of the FAQs (and space
permitting), all the associated ancillary material.  And, of course,
priority email replies to technical questions!  Thank you! :)

<h2>Version Update Information</A></h2>

While there may be small updates as well as more substantial additions
almost daily, when the number of revised and added bits reaches
a critical (but random) threshold, the version number will change.  Beyond
a larger but also random threshold, an entry is added here to summarize
the major enhancements that may be noteworthy, and the version number
will increment by a large (also random) number.  But, even if the version
number doesn't change, the date of this page and
<A HREF="lasertoc.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ Comprehensive Table of Contents</A>
will always reflect the latest ZIP file archive.  The ZIP file archive is
updated whenever a file (like a .gif) is added to the Laser FAQ, or at
some somewhat random interval, usually less than 1 week.  If you aren't
totally confused by now, send me email and explain what I just said so
I will understand it. :)

<h3><A NAME="samv9.90">What's New as of V9.90</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>The chapter on commercial HeNe lasers reached critical mass and has
 been split into chapters:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hcltoc">Commercial Unstabilized HeNe Lasers</A>.
  The common HeNe lasers most people care about used for alignment,
  barcode scanners, light shows, spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, etc.
<p>
 <li><A HREF="laserhst.htm#hsttoc">Commercial Stabilized HeNe Lasers</A>.
  Single or two-frequency HeNe lasers used for interferometry, metrology,
  as a wavelength reference, etc.  These are the lasers I get my jollies
  from. :)
</ul>
<p>
 Much more on Hewlett Packard/Agilent metrology lasers has
 been added including photos of an original 5500A laser head with
 5505A display that is fully functional after some 40 years.
 Many photos of the 5500A and 5500C laser heads have been added to the
 <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</a>.
<p>
 There are now high quaility scans of operation and service manuals for
 several discontinued HP laser metrology products.  These include the
 5501A and 5501B laser heads as well as complete 5526A and 5528A
 laser measurement systems (which include the 5500C and 5518A laser heads,
 respectively).

<ul>
<li>Every external link in Sam's Laser FAQ (and the other documents of the
 Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ) has been checked.  Most dead links have
 either been removed or corrected.  A very few have been left in place
 with the hope that they were only dead temporarily.
 If one of your links has disappeared,
 contact me via the email link at the top of this page.  Companies, large
 and small, that constantly reorganize their Web sites in such a way that
 links no longer work should be ashamed of themselves. :( :)
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="samv8.50">What's New as of V8.50</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>Additional information on stabilized HeNe lasers has been added including
 the Spectra-Physics 117C and Laboratory For Science Models 200 and 220

<li>Sam's Laser FAQ now has its own Web domains:
 <A HREF="http://www.laserfaq.com">laserfaq.com</A>,
 <A HREF="http://www.laserfaq.net">laserfaq.net</A>, and
 <A HREF="http://www.laserfaq.org">laserfaq.org</A>.
 Going to one of these will redirect you to a Web site with a recent version
 of Sam's Laser FAQ.  A German translation is also under development and will
 be available there and at <A HREF="http://www.laserfaq.de">laserfaq.de</A>
 in the future.
<p>
<li>The chapters on solid state lasers have progressed significantly and there
 is now a separate one on <A HREF="laserssc.htm#ssctoc">Complete SS Laser Power
 Supply Schematics</A> with complete systems suitable for driving the pulsed
 ruby and YAG laser heads common on the surplus market.
<p>
<li>A couple of really ancient versions of Sam's Laser FAQ and a link to
 another one have been collected at the
 <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/slfarchv/">Sam's Laser FAQ Archive</A>
 just to offer an idea of how this collection evolved.  If nothing else, it
 beats counting sheep for insomnia. :)
<p>
<li>Copyright notices have been added to the start and end of all text files.
 I did this after finding bits and pieces of Sam's Laser FAQ at random
 Web sites around the World with no mention of origin or author and dead
 links to pages that might have had these attributions.
</ul>

 complete and this effort is still progressing.  There is also the start of
 a chapter on <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strtoc">SS Laser Testing, Adjustment,
 Repair</A>.
<p>
<li>There is now a chapter on <A HREF="laserexp.htm#exptoc">Laser Experiments
 and Projects</A>.  This is mostly just a list of suggested topics and links
 to a few laser project Web sites at the moment but should be filled in as
 time passes.
<p>
<li>This welcome page has gotten a little structure. :)
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="samv5.20">What's New as of V5.20</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>The chapters on <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssltoc">Solid State Lasers</A> and
 <A HREF="lasersps.htm#spstoc">SS Laser Power Supplies</A> have finally
 arrived (though they are somewhat sparsely filled in at present).  Stay
 tuned. :)
<p>
<li>There are several sections in the chapters on
 <A HREF="laserhen.htm#hentoc">Helium-Neon Lasers</A> and
 <A HREF="laserchn.htm#chntoc">Home-Built Helium-Neon Laser</A> describing
 the use of HeNe laser tubes with one or two Brewster windows for the
 construction of external mirror HeNe lasers using readily available
 components.
<p>
<li>Schematics have been added for several new HeNe laser power supplies as
 well as a couple of argon ion laser heads (including the very common
 Cyonics/Uniphase 2214).
<p>
<li>The information on <A HREF="laserhec.htm#hectoc">Helium-Cadmium Lasers</A>
 has been consolidated into a chapter of its own.
<p>
<li>One of the new wings of the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment
 Gallery</a> presents the dissection of a green laser pointer based on diode
 pumped solid state frequency doubled technology.  Don't miss out on all the
 exciting (and gory) details! :)
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="samv5.00">What's New as of V5.00</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>A new chapter on the <A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgtoc">Home-Built Pulsed
 Multiple Gas (PMG) Laser</A> which is relatively easy to construct and may
 use argon, krypton, xenon, oxygen - maybe even plain ordinary air.
<p>
<li>Several new schematics including one of the Spectra-Physics 261A exciter
 which is used to power the SP-125 large frame helium-neon laser.
<p>
<li>A <a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lohwr/">Portal to The
 Laser, Optics, and Holography Ring</A>.  This is an inter-navigable Webring
 of related sites.
<p>
<li>The paper: <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lr/">Micro-Laser
 Range Finder Development: Using the Monolithic Approach</A> presents a
 system using a Nd:YAG laser and OPO which is pumped by the electronic flash
 unit from a single-use (disposable) pocket camera.
<p>
<li>Many new wings as well as expansion to existing wings in the
 <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</a>.
<p>
<li>A <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/cord/">Link page to the
 CORD Lasers/Electro-Optics Series of On-Line Courses</A>. (No longer
 valid.)
<p>
 (Note: As of Summer, 2002, these courses have
 been removed from the CORD Web site supposedly due to the expiration of their
 funding.  While the courses are available for purchase in
 print form, It's a pity that this has happened.  Print is not the same as
 on-line, even if it were free.  I am looking into hosting them on
 one of my Web sites but suspect that in the end, such a request will be denied
 due to commercial interests winning out over availability of information.)
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="samv4.75">What's New as of V4.75</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>The <A HREF="lasertoc.htm">Comprehensive Table of Contents</A> now provides
 Direct links to every chapter and section from one Web page.
<p>
<li>Several more ion laser schematics have been added including a couple of
 basic power supply designs that are easy to build as well as the circuit
 diagram of the quite common NEC GLG-3030 laser head.
<p>
<li>Several chapters including the one on home-built lasers (that was quite
 bloated) have been split to decrease loading times.
<p>
<li>Several new wings have been added to the
 <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</a> including one with
 photos of a Coherent 541 flowing gas CO2 laser - essentially a commercial
 version of the type of system that can be built by a determined amateur.
</ul>

</ul>

<h3><A NAME="samv4.25">What's New as of V4.25</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>Diagrams for all seven types of Home-Built Lasers similar to
 those found in the Scientific American articles are now included in the
 chapters on amateur laser construction.  The drawings show the basic structure
 and power supply for each laser assembly and should provide at least some of
 the overall flavor of what is involved in building these devices from scratch.
<p>
<li>The <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">
 Laser Equipment Gallery</a> provides a variety of Photos of Lasers and 
 Laser Related Equipment inside and out.  New wings will be added as
 material arrives.
<p>
Note that this extensive set of photos is in addition to all those found in
<A HREF="laserfaq.htm">Sam's Laser FAQ</A>.  Due to the number of bits in
these graphics files, the current FAQ distributions only include a page that
provides links to sites where they are resident.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="samv4.00">What's New as of V4.00</A></h3>

<ul>
<li>Argon and Krypton Ion Lasers are now covered in great detail
 providing the only known readily accessible detailed discussion of their

 system design considerations for these very desirable devices.  There are
 even complete schematics for several different Ar/Kr ion laser power supplies!
<p>
<li>Two complete chapters provide extensive information on Amateur Laser
 Construction including material from the Scientific American collection
 "Light and its Uses" as well as the email, Web sites, articles, and
 experiences of those who have been successful in building their own lasers
 from scratch (not taking the easy way out and using commercial tubes or laser
 diodes!) and getting them to work - or have given it their best shot trying!
 Also included: basics of vacuum systems and glass working, where to get
 strange parts, the well equipped home laser lab, and much much more.
<p>
<li>A chapter on Carbon Dioxide Lasers is included as well.
<p>
<li>The text formatting has also been greatly improved including a complete
 Sub-Table of Contents for each chapter and intra-FAQ hot links that now work!
