<h2>AC Line Operated and Inverter Types</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hpdacl0">Circuits for Keeping a HeNe Laser Tube Happily Fed</A></h3>

Many alternatives abound where a HeNe laser power supply must be constructed
from scratch.  Decisions must be made based on the size or range of sizes of
the HeNe tube(s) to be powered, convenience, need for portability (well in a
relative sort of way), availability of components, and so forth.
<p>
This chapter deals with the more practical aspects of HeNe laser power supply
design including circuits for providing the HeNe tube operating voltage (AC
line and inverter types), starters, regulators, and modulators.  There are
many options for each subsystem and it is often possible to mix and match as
desired!

<h3><A NAME="hpdacl1">AC Line Operated Versus Inverter Based Power Supplies</A></h3>

A variety of techniques can be used to provide the starting and operating
voltages for HeNe lasers.  It is, after all, just a special type of gas
discharge tube so almost any approach that can convince the HeNe tube to pass
the proper current will be satisfactory.
<ul>
<li>AC line operated approaches are generally larger and heavier due to the
  power transformer which must run at the line frequency - 50 or 60 Hz.
  The designs are very straightforward and aside from the power transformer,
  all parts are inexpensive and readily available.
<p>
<li>Inverter based approaches are generally small, light weight, and efficient,
  but may require more sophistication in design and hard-to-obtain, expensive,
  or custom parts.
<p>
  These may run off of low voltage DC or the AC line but in the latter case
  convert the AC into DC first and then use a high frequency chopper and small
  transformer to generate their output.
</ul>
Both types may include internal current regulation or have their voltage and
current adjusted with a variable power input (Variac or variable DC supply
as appropriate).
<p>
Modulation inputs may also be provided to permit the transmission of audio or
data over the HeNe beam to enable external closed loop control of beam power.
<p>
Some more sophisticated commercial power supply designs provide a variety of
'soft start' and other features to maximize HeNe tube life.  Others enable
'instant start' for applications where the HeNe tube must be switched on and
off frequently.  These sorts of advanced forms of regulation are not really
needed for general applications - which is just as well since the circuits
tend to be proprietary and not available.  Some of it may have been Marketing
Departement driven specsmanship - how else to distinguish YOUR HeNe laser power
supply from everyone else's virtually identical units? :-)

<h3><A NAME="hpdacl2">Notation used in HeNe Laser Power Supply Diagrams and
 Schematics</h3></A>

Throughout this chapter and the next, a quasi-standard method (mine!) is used
to identify and label some of the connections between and among parts of the
power supply, HeNe tube, and the external world.  Here is a summary of the
meanings of the notations used in the sample circuit diagrams and complete
schematics:
<ul>
<li>G = AC line safety (earth) Ground.
<li>H = AC line Hot.
<li>N = AC line Neutral.
<p>
<li>HV+ = the positive output of the power supply (operating and starting voltage) but prior to the ballast resistor.
<li>HV- = the negative return (direct, or via a sense resistor or linear regulator).
<p>
<li>X = an AC output of the power transformer which may be used to drive a parasitic multiplier.
<li>Y = the positive DC HV from the rectifier/filter (but prior to any linear regulator).
<li>Z = an intermediate DC voltage used with HV- to power some isolated pulse starting circuits.
<li>W = an intermediate DC voltage used with Y to power some non-isolated pulse starting circuits.
<p>
<li>Tube+ = the actual connection to the anode terminal of the HeNe tube.
<li>Tube- = the actual connection to the cathode terminal of the HeNe tube.
<p>
<li>Rb = total ballast resistance, Rbp+Rba+Rbc.
<li>Rbp = ballast resistance contained within power supply (connected to HV+).
<li>Rba = ballast resistance near HeNe tube anode (Tube+).
<li>Rbc = ballast resistance near HeNe tube cathode (Tube-, usually not
 present).
</ul>

Note that in this document and the associated laser power supply schematics,
voltages between 110 and 120 VAC Hot to Neutral (220 to 240 VAC between
Hots on opposite sides of the line) may be shown for power in the USA and
other parts of North America.  Likewise, 220 to 240 VAC may be shown for power
in Europe and elsewhere.  Where some other voltage is used (such as 100 VAC in
parts of Japan), it will be ideentified explicitly.

<h3><A NAME="hpdacl3">AC Line Operated Power Supplies</A></h3>

These are quite simple consisting of a high voltage transformer, rectifier
or doubler, filter capacitor stack, starting circuit, and optional current
regulator.  Input is from either the 115 or 230 VAC line (or perhaps some
slighlty different voltage depending on where you live).  For details, see
the chapter: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe Laser Power Supply Schematics</A>.
<p>
Note: Throughout this document, we use 115 VAC as the nominal line voltage in
the U.S.  However, the actual measured voltage may range from about 105 to 125
VAC and still be considered to be within acceptable limits by the utility
company.  For this single-phase system, using both Hot legs of the line will
then result in a nominal 230 VAC which may actually range from about 210 to
250 VAC.
<p>
The transformer output generally feeds a half wave rectifier or 2 diode 2
capacitor doubler and filter capacitor stack.
<p>
Either a parasitic voltage multiplier or pulse (trigger) type starting circuit
can be used with these designs.
<p>
Compared to inverter type power supplies, line operated units are easier to
construct (no custom transformer is needed) and troubleshoot (there are no
transistors to blow by the bucketload).  Of course, they are not nearly as
portable in two ways: the power transformers you are likely to find are
usually quite heavy and there is that annoying line cord to drag around!
<p>
However, most of the components are readily available or can be constructed
from common parts including the high voltage diodes and capacitors:
<p>
<ul>
<li>High voltage diodes with sufficient voltage and current ratings are used
 in microwave ovens (12 to 15 kV at .5 A typical).  They may also be
 constructed from strings of 1N4007 (or similar) types rather easily.
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhvc0">Standard and Custom HV
 Rectifiers</A>.
<p>
<li>Filter capacitors with sufficient uF and voltage ratings are used in
 microwave ovens (1 uF at 2,500 VAC which is over 3,500 VDC typical).  They
 can be also built up from lower voltage electrolytic capacitors (10 uF at
 450 V typical).  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhvc2">Series
 Banks of Capacitors</A>.
</ul>
<p>
The only problem may be the power transformer which is typically 600 to 1,200
VRMS at 20 mA or so:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The power transformer from an old tube type TV or audio amplifier would be
 suitable (though gross overkill - probably 5 to 10 times the current that is
 actually needed for a typical power supply).  Check your attic. :-)  If you
 do use such a transformer, then it is essential to be even more aware of the
 safety issues - these can be lethal.
<p>
<li>The output voltage can usually be adjusted up to +/-10% of its rated value
 by using the (otherwise unneeded) filament windings (5 and 6.3 VRMS typical)
 in series with the *primary* in phase (decreases output) or out of phase
 (increases output).  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdacl5">Boosting
 the Output of a Transformer with Multiple Secondary Windings</A>.
<p>
<li>You may be able to stretch this another 20 percent or so by connecting the
 secondary of a separate low voltage power transformer in series with primary
 of the HV transformer in or out of phase as above.
<p>
 CAUTION: Do not be tempted to increase the high voltage output of a power
 transformer by more than 30 percent or so above it rated value (by either
 driving its primary with a higher than rated voltage or by adding booster
 windings in series with the primary).  Even this may be excessive depending
 on its design margins.  At some point core saturation will result in a
 dramatic increase in input current, overheating, meltdown, smoke, 6 foot
 flames, etc.
<p>
 In addition, the insulation ratings may be inadequate for the increased high
 voltages now produced by the secondary.
<p>
 Thus using a 115 V transformer on 230 VAC to obtain double the output is
 probably not a good idea though I know people who have done this and lived
 to tell!
<p>
<li>The high voltage transformer can also be constructed from more than one
 transformer.  You can put two or three secondaries in series, but don't get
 carried away since a lower voltage transformer may not be insulated for the
 high voltages (several kV) present in a HeNe laser power supply.
<p>
 For example, using two 380 VRMS transformers in series will result in over
 2,000 VDC without playing games and 2,200 to 2,500 V with one of the booster
 techniques described above.
<p>
<li>Oil burner ignition transformers provide about 10 kV at 15 to 25 mA.  Their
 output is center-tapped (to the case - which should be earth grounded for
 safety) so a full wave rectified supply putting out up to around 4 kV at
 8 mA can be easily constructed.  Note: These are basically similar to small
 neon sign (luminous tube) transformers which would also work but may not be
 as inexpensive (see below).
<p>
 These are suitable for intermediate size HeNe tubes - 5 to 20 mW.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The benefit of oil burner ignition transformers is that they can be
  obtained for next to nothing or free from your local HVAC contractor as
  they are discarded when oil burners are replaced and are almost always in
  perfect operating condition.  However, the HVAC person will probably
  require that you take the entire filthy, smelly, disgusting oil burner off
  their hands as part of the deal. :-)
<p>
 <li>The problem with oil burner ignition transformers is that they use a
  loosely coupled magnetic structure to provide current limiting.  This
  results in extremely large voltage droop - poor voltage regulation - with
  even modest current.  In effect, the transformer has a high internal
  impedance (for AC, the DC resistance is relatively low).  It isn't linear
  either since just measuring short circuit current and open circuit voltage
  as would normally be done to determine a (Thevenin) equivalent circuit
  results in a resistance that is too low - the incremental resistance is
  higher than predicted.
<p>
  What this means in the end is that although the open circuit voltage (full
  wave rectified and filtered) may approach 7 kV (for a 10 kV unit), voltage
  is down about 30 percent at 6 mA.  This is no problem if used on a Variac
  with current monitoring though but the practical upper limit on operating
  voltage is only about 4 kV.
<p>
  Although, as noted, the current limited behavior is not linear, it can be
  approximated by assuming an internal current limiting resistor and an
  ideal transformer.  For a 10 kVAC RMS, 20 mA transformer, the internal
  equivalent series resistance would be about 500K ohms across the entire
  winding or 250K ohms per side (center tapped).  When used for the
  intended application - be it producing an arc to ignite an oil burner
  flame or powering a neon sign (using a luminous tube transformer which is
  basically similar), no ballast resistor is needed to protect the load or
  transformer.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help us since the rectifiers and
  filter capacitors come between the transformer and HeNe tube :-(.
<p>
  Also, because the open circuit voltage is much higher than the actual
  operating voltage, there will be a current spike through the HeNe tube at
  the instant it starts of many times the normal operating current.
  However, for a typical design, the total energy in this pulse is not very
  large even at the upper limit of the power supply.  For example, with a
  total filter capacitance of .25 uF, an open circuit voltage of 7 kV, and
  an operating voltage of 4 kV, the energy delivered to the HeNe tube by
  this pulse will be only about 2 to 4 w-s (J).  I do not know if this will
  result in significantly shortened tube life in the long run under normal
  usage (reasonable number of starting cycles).
 </ul>
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg2">Sam's Mid-Size Line Powered
 HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL2)</A> for a sample design using an oil burner
 ignition transformer.
<p>
<li>I DO NOT recommend the following boat anchors: large neon sign (luminous
 tube) transformers, microwave oven transformers, utility pole transformers,
 and 100 kVA substation transformers. :-)  These would likely result in
 designs that were impractical, excessively expensive, or extremely dangerous.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Large neon sign or luminous tube transformers (same thing) provide 12 to
  15 kV at 15 to 60 mA (some much higher).  This is way too much voltage and
  way too much current.  They may be usable at reduced line voltage but are
  really too big to be practical.  Yes, even though you may find the words
  'neon' and 'tube' in their names, these beasts should be avoided (for this
  purpose at least).  There may be exceptions with respect to really large
  HeNe tubes (35 mW+) but these are not really appropriate for 1 mW bar code
  scanners!
<p>
  The characteristics of these neon sign transformers are similar to those
  of oil burner ignition transformers (see above) but typically have
  higher voltage and current ratings, and are thus much larger and heavier.
  They also may have a more constant current characteristic - delivering
  nearly their rated current up to a good percentage of their no load output
  voltage (to handle a variable length of neon tubing).  For example, a
  12 kV, 30 mA unit may behave like an equivalent 30 kV source in series
  with a 1M ohm resistor for loads resulting in an output voltage of up to
  6 or 8 kV.
<p>
 <li>Microwave oven transformers produce the required output voltage (1,500
  to 2,500 V) but are capable of very high current at high voltage - perhaps
  more than an Amp.  This is an instantly lethal combination which means
  they are just too dangerous to consider.  They will also instantly blow
  your HeNe tube if your ballast resistor shorts out (I found out the hard
  way on a large expensive HeNe tube).  Don't even be tempted!
<p>
 <li>Utility pole and substation transformers.  Aside from requiring a fork
  lift or 10 ton crane to move, I don't think the power company would be
  happy if one of these were to disappear one night. :-)
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
If you have the option of obtaining a slightly higher voltage transformer than
you actually need, go for it.  However, the key word here is 'slightly' - not
something 10 times too big!  Then, if you acquire a higher power tube in the
future, you will be all set.  For now, it will just require a larger ballast
resistor or Variac to run at reduced input voltage.
<p>
It might be worth trying a TV or audio equipment repair shop - they may have
spare transformers from old tube sets laying around gathering dust.  These
are ideal and can probably be had for next to nothing.
<p>
Another option is an electronics surplus supplier - I have seen suitable
transformers at some of these in the past but don't know what is currently
available.
<p>
A 3 or 4 stage voltage multiplier could be used to boost the output of a lower
voltage transformer if a suitable high voltage transformer cannot be located.
However, to obtain the needed current, the capacitors would need to be quite
large - perhaps 1 uF at 1,000 V or more. Also, you would then probably need
to use a pulse type starting circuit as a multiplier type starting circuit may
not be able to provide enough output with a reasonable number of stages since
the available p-p input voltage will be less with this approach.
<p>
I have recently been using the power transformer from a long dead tube type TV
both for testing a higher power commercial HeNe supply board and as the basis
for a power supply of my own.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg1">Sam's Small Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply
(SG-HL1)</A>.  There was a selector for line voltage adjustment built into the
transformer.  With this set for lowest line voltage (and thus highest output)
and the filament windings connected out of phase, it produces over 900 VRMS at
115 VAC input and over 1,150 VRMS using a Variac that goes up to 140 VAC.
This translates into a doubled DC voltage of between 2,500 and 3,000 VDC -
more than ample for most HeNe tubes up to 10 mW.

<h3><A NAME="hpdacl4">AC Input Circuitry for HeNe Laser Power Supplies</A></h3>

For safety and protection, you will need a fuse, line switch, and power-on
indicator at a minimum:

Note that the fuse is shown as the first component after the line cord.  This
provides the most protection where the fuse is located on the panel next to
the cord entrance.  However, it may be more appropriate to put the power
switch first if the fuse is located on a circuit board or other distant
location.  Both arrangements are common in commercial equipment.
<p>
Important: Use a grounded (3 wire) line cord and connect earth ground to the
case (if it is made of metal), transformer core, and high voltage return of the
tube (Tube- on the schematics below).  This will assure that the tube housing
is grounded and that no fault (like a short inside the power transformer) will
result in any user accessible parts becoming electrically live as long as the
line cord is plugged into a properly grounded outlet.  The alternative is to
double insulate everything but this may be impossible if you are using a
commercial laser head where the tube cathode is already connected to its metal
shell.

<h3><A NAME="hpdacl5">Boosting the Output of a Transformer with Multiple
 Secondary Windings</A></h3>

If you are using a transformer from a tube type TV or amplifier and want to
boost the output a bit, determine how to connect the unused filament windings
as follows.  (This assumes you have a typical pair of filament windings on
your transformer):
<ol>
<li>Temporarily connect the 5 V (yellow) and 6.3 V (green) windings in series.
   Power the transformer and measure the output across the ends of this
   'booster' winding.
<p>
<ul>
   <li>If it measures around 11.3 V, proceed to (2).
<p>
   <li>If it measures around 1.3 V, interchange the yellow or green wires but
     not both.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Power the transformer and measure the high voltage winding.
<p>
   CAUTION: This is probably over 700 V with significant current available.
   Take care.  Make a note of your reading and then disconnect power.
<p>
<li>Temporarily connect the booster wiinding from (1) in series with the
   primary.  Power the transformer and measure the high voltage winding.
<p>
<ul>
   <li>If the high voltage now reads higher than in (2), you are finished.
<p>
   <li>If it measures less, disconnect power and reverse the connections to the
     to the booster winding.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Use Wire Nuts(tm) or solder to premanently connect the windings in the
   desired configuration.
</ol>
This approach should result in an increase by a factor of 110/99.7 or about
10 percent.  Use a similar procedure to decrease the voltage.  Depending on
your needs and your particular transformer, adjust appropriately.
<p>
Alternatively, you can probably safely achieve up to a 25 or 30 percent boost
using a separate low voltage power transformer to provide your booster winding.
(Start with step (2).
<p>
For example, with a 24 V transformer, a 26 percent increase in output voltage
will result - this is probably about the limit before you risk core saturation
with a typical transformer but your mileage may vary.
<p>
CAUTION: On transformers with dual primary windings (to support 115 or 230
VAC power), it is possibly in principle to use one of these to drive the supply
and the other as a booster on the secondary side.  I Do not recommend this
approach as the insulation between the two primary windings may be inadequate.

<h3><A NAME="hpdacl6">Inverter Type Power Supplies</A></h3>

Most modern designs are of this type since they can be made small, light
weight, and efficient.  However, component selection and procurement can
be an issue for hobbyists and producing a reliable system can be more of
a challenge than for AC line operated supplies.
<p>
Several types are possible:
<ol>
<li>Power oscillator inverter using a variety of simple configurations.  These
 usually require either a custom wound ferrite transformer or a modified
 flyback transformer.  Aside from the transformer, these are extremely simple
 requiring typically a half dozen components - all readily available.
<p>
 However, self oscillating designs are generally not as efficient as driven
 ones (see below) and may be unstable under certain load conditions.
<p>
<li>Driven inverter using a separate oscillator (e.g., 555 timer) to switch
 current to a stepup transformer.  As with (1) above, the transformer can
 be custom or a modified flyback.  These inverters can be made very flexible
 with adjustable frequency and duty cycle as well a feedback loop for
 regulation.
<p>
<li>Inverter using controller chips and/or power devices from companies like
 Linear Technology, Maxim, Motorola, and others.  For these, application
 notes will be available but modifications will usually be needed to adapt
 their circuits for the required much higher than usual output voltage.
</ol>

<p>
With any of these, the starting circuit can be separate (a voltage multiplier
or pulse type) or built in as part of a high compliance design.
<p>
For DIY projects, it is best to run the inverters from low voltage DC.  While
it is also possible to build inverters that operate directly from the power
line (commercial power supplies often do this) with just rectification and
filtering, I <b>DO NOT</b> recommend this as an option here for two reasons:

<ol>
<li>There is a significant added level of danger when dealing with the
 testing of line connected circuitry.
<p>
<li>It is much easier to blow up mountains of power transistors and other
 components when running at 150 VDC compared to 12 VDC before a design is
 perfected!
</ol>

See the chapter: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe Laser Power
Supply Schematics</A> for sample circuits of types (1) and (2).
<p>
For an example of (3), HeNe laser drive circuitry is briefly covered in a
Linear Technology Corp. application note: AN-49, p.13.  This is a low voltage
DC powered circuit using an LT1170 chip for fully automatic starting and
feedback control of operating current.  It is essentially a constant current
supply with a voltage compliance range of 10 kV.  HeNe tube power requirements
are also discussed.  Unfortunately, the special transformer may not be readily
obtained.
<p>
Although there is somewhat less of a shock hazard with an inverter running
from low voltage DC, grounding the metal case of a laser head and other metal
parts is still desirable unless they are totally isolated from user contact
(e.g., everything is in a plastic enclosure).
<p>
The main difficulty from the hobbyist's perspective in building an inverter
type power supply from scratch may be in obtaining or constructing the required
high frequency ferrite transformer since these aren't the sort of thing that
can be purchased at Radio Shack.  However, I have successfully wound my own
transformer (from a bare core and bobbin) to repair a commercial power supply
(see the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic3">HeNe Laser Power Supply from
HeNe Laser Pointer (IC-HI3)</A>).
<p>
Another option that may or may not work (I have not tried this) is to use a
fluorescent backlight inverter (for/from a laptop or other LCD) or even a
battery powered lantern as the basis of a HeNe laser power supply.  Since
there generate up to 1,000 VAC or more with a few mA available at 10s to 100s
of kHz, the addition of a rectifier or doubler, and starting multiplier may
be all that is needed.  However, some commercial designs are too smart for
their own good (at least for this application) and may shut down if the
exact conditions they expect are not met.

<h3><A NAME="hpdspsd">Switchmode HeNe Laser Power Supplies Using Digital Control</A></h3>

So how many blown HeNe laser power supply bricks do you have in your
junk pile.  I probably have enough to provide ballast for the Queen Mary. :)
<p>
However, with modern implementations of switchmode power supplies utilizing
digital control techniques, catastrophic failure due to external faults or
user abuse should be a thing of the past.  With traditional analog control,
pulse width modulator ICs, op-amps, and discrete components are used for the
drive of the switching transistors or MOSFETs, and for fault detection.  These
schemes are often ad-hoc and testing for all possible fault conditions is
not really possible.  But with digital control, a microprocessor implements
the feedback equations in firmware and generates (or at least directly
supervises) the switchmode drive signals, and monitors for over-current,
over-voltage, arc-faults, and other error conditions on a cycle-by-cycle
basis.  It can then instantly shut down the supply long before any damage
to it or the laser can take place.  Explosive decomposition of a potted
module due to accdidentally powering up with a shorting strap still attached
would be a thing of the past.  They would also be able to recognize
that a laser wasn't starting and modify the output voltage appropriately.
For example, by cycling it between 0 and maximum rapidly to take advantage
of the dV/dt of the voltage to help ionize the gas.  It could also detect
a laser that was having trouble staying lit at the selected current and
modify the dynamic ballast resistance as required, or shut down if that
didn't help.
<p>
By now, the "Smart HeNe Laser Power Supply" should be standard practice in
the industry but old habits take time to die. :)

<h2>High Voltage Components, Construction Issues</h2>

Locating suppliers of high voltage rectifiers, capacitors, and resistors
is often more challenging than normal parts.  Common electronics
distributors like Digikey and Mouser tend to either not stock multi-kV
components, or if they do, charge ridiculous prices.  Electronics surplus
sources may have a sporadic assortment of HV parts.
<p>
<A HREF="http://www.eBay.com/">eBay</A> and
<A HREF="http://stores.ebay.com/">eBay Stores</A> always have a wide
selection of high voltage components, some at attractive prices both
individually and in large quantities.  And searching is easy and quick.
However, keep in mind that many of these parts are imports
(China, Russia, and elsewhere) so quality cannot
be guaranteed and may vary from batch to batch, and even if there
is a warranty, returns  may not be worth the hassle and postage.
<p>
More on specific types of components below.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhvc0">Standard and Custom HV Rectifiers</A></h3>

One of the common difficulties in constructing high voltage power supplies
for HeNe, CO2, and other lasers is obtaining suitable high voltage rectifiers.
<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.hvca.com/">HV Component Associates, Inc.</A> is a
 supplier of many types of high voltage rectifiers.  They almost certainly will
 have exactly what you need but I don't know if the price will be right.  See
 the section: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpsnsw5">Mail Order - Electronic
 Components</A> for more information.
<p>
<li>Another possibility is <A HREF="http://www.edidiodes.com/">Electronic
 Devices, Inc. (EDO)</A> who offer diodes, bridges, HV assemblies, and
 special devices.  And, one in China: 
 <A HREF="http://www.hv-diode.com/">HV-Diode.com</A>.  (Their Homepage is
 mostly in Japanese but they have product pages in English.)
<p>
<li><A HREF="http://www.allelectronics.com/">All Electronics</A> currently
 lists 6kV, 200 mA rectifiers for $.50 each.  These (alone or a small number in
 series) would be suitable for most HeNe and CO2 laser power supplies.
<p>
<li>High voltage rectifiers up to about 2 kV seem to be readily available and
 inexpensive from large electronics distributors, and parts suppliers like MCM
 Electronics (e.g., R2000F, a fast recovery type rated 2 kV at .5 A).  Devices
 with higher ratings do exist but are harder to find.  For example:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Philips - BY706 and BY716 (both 6 kV at 20 mA).
 <li>SemTech - SDHD7.5K (7.5 kV at 800 mA).
 <li>EDI - XL10 (9 kV at 220 mA) and CRVT series (25 kV at 25 mA).
<p>
 <li>Microwave oven HV rectifier (12 to 15 kV at 500 mA).
 <li>B/W and color monitor/TV HV rectifier (20 to 50 kV at 3 to 5 mA).
 <li>Electronic air cleaner HV rectifier (10 kV at a few mA).
 </ul>
<p>
 These types of devices are generally much more expensive on per-kV basis
 compared to parts like the 1N4007 as well.  ECG, NTE, and SK also have a
 variety of replacements of various ratings (probably even more pricey).
 See the section: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpsnsw5">Mail Order - Electronic
 Components</A> and the document:
 <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tshoot.htm">Troubleshooting of
 Consumer Electronic Equipment</A> for contact info.
<p>
 (Note: As of January 2001, NTE has purchased the assets of ECG so the ECG
 parts listed below may no longer be available, use the NTE or SK equivalent
 which usually has the same number with the 'NTE' or 'SK' prefix.)
</ul>
<p>
However, there are alternatives to ordering special high voltage rectifiers
from electronics distributors or surplus sources, or even ripping apart the
family microwave or TV to build your laser power supply (though salvage from
these sources - after they are certifiably dead and thrown out! - is well
worth the effort).  Other sources include: electronic air cleaners, igniters,
bug zappers, and photocopier and laser printer HV power supplies.  Modules
from these devices with nice HV components may be available surplus at
ridiculously low prices.
<p>
A series string of dirt cheap 1N4007s can be used to construct high voltage
rectifiers for line frequency power supplies and seems to be acceptable up to
a few kHz for inverter based power supplies.  Equalizing components do not
appear to be needed - at least where these diodes come from the same lot
number.  Modern devices are matched closely in terms of leakage current and
capacitance.  However, the construction DOES need to take into account
requirements for high voltage insulation - adequate spacing and the rounding
off and possibly coating of exposed wires/connections especially where the
very high starting voltages are involved.  A variety of mounting techniques
can be used including soldering end-to-end installed in a plastic or glass
tube, and on or between pieces of perfboard.
<p>
The common 1N4007s cost only a few cents each in quantity (typically between
$.01 and $.06, though much higher from Radio Shack).  Thus, it is generally
possible to construct high voltage rectifiers at significantly lower cost than
buying microwave oven, TV, or similar commercial types.  And, it is trivial to
construct whatever size you need!  I recommend derating by 30 to 50 percent
just to be on the safe side.  So, where you need a 5 kV rectifier, use 7 or 8
1N4007s in series.
<p>
I have used this approach for power supplies that I have built.  See the
sections: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg1">Sam's Small Line Powered HeNe Laser
Power Supply (SG-HL1)</A> and <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg4">Sam's Inverter
Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 1 (SG-HI1)</A>.  In addition, in order to
repair a particular HeNe laser power supply - the one described in the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat4">Aerotech model PS2A-X HeNe laser power supply
(AT-PS2A-X)</A> - after accidentally shorting its output and blowing most of
the original HV diodes in the multiplier, I replaced them each with strings of
four 1N4007s.  There were much much cheaper than the exact replacements and
seem to work just as well.  However, where really high voltages are involved -
like the later stages of the starting voltage multiplier - it is essential to
smooth out the additional connections and coat or pot these diode assemblies
to minimize the tendency for corona and arcing.
<p>
Note that you still may want to consider microwave oven rectifiers since these
are readily available for $2 or 3 in single quantities from service parts
suppliers like MCM Electronics.  At 12 to 15 kV, the cost is higher than
for a string of 1N4007s but the convenience of wiring a single part rather
than 15 or 20 may be worth it.  However, in their normal application, these
is no more than about 5 or 6 kV across the device.  Where you are using them
close to their PRV ratings, potting would probably be a good idea.
<p>
For high frequency inverters (e.g., 10s of kHz or more), fast or ultrafast
recovery type rectifiers must be used since at a frequency equal to 1/(2*Trr),
diodes turn into short circuits.  For example, a nice 1 kV, 1 A part like the
1N4948 has a reverse recovery time (trr) of 500 ns.  Thus, it should have
acceptable performance up to at least 200 kHz (my rule of thumb for maximum
frequency of a diode: around 20% of 1/trr).  Note that putting multiple diodes
in series scales the junction capacitance by 1/n (where n is the number of
diodes in the string) but does NOT affect Trr.
<p>
(From: Kim Clay (bkc@maco.net).)
<p>
All of my HV diodes have been made using 1N4007s from
<A HREF="http://www.fix.net/%7ejparker/dans.html">Dan's Small Parts</A>
without any equalizing components.  I make my HV diodes in separate assemblies
using strips of perfboard cut with an Xacto razor saw to just one hole wide
whatever length I need to mount all the 1N4007s.  I cut 2 of them for each
diode assembly and set the diodes in one strip first (first one anode up, next
down, next up, etc...) then slide the other strip over the other ends of the
diodes.  Then, bend over all the middle interconnecting leads, trim very
short, and solder with a nice round ball on each connection to minimize
corona.  I leave the full length leads on the first anode and the last cathode
and now I have a 'custom' diode assembly of whatever voltage I need!

<h3><A NAME="hpdhvc1">Standard and Custom HV Capacitors</A></h3>

Most types and value of capacitors can be obtained from the major electronics
distributors or service parts sources (see the chapter:
<A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A>.  Voltage ratings of
small ceramic capacitors of 6.3 kV or more (perhaps up to 15 kV), as well as
electrolytic types up to 450 or 500 V are available.  However, they tend to be
somewhat more expensive than low voltage types and are definitely less common
than they were in the good old days of vacuum tube technology. :-)
<p>
Microwave ovens include a capacitor of about 1 uF rated for at least 3 kV, and
TVs and computer monitors may include 1 or 2 low uF, 1.6 to 2 kV ceramic caps.
Higher voltage (but low uF value) caps can be found in equipment like:
electronic air cleaners, igniters, bug zappers, and photocopier and laser
printer HV power supplies.  Modules from these devices with nice HV components
may be available surplus at ridiculously low prices.
<p>
In some cases, a stack of regular capacitors will suffice but not always, and
using a single capacitor with the proper ratings will be best, especially in
areas like the voltage multipliers of HeNe laser starting circuits.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhvc2">Series Banks of Capacitors</A>.
<p>
For modest values (up to a few thousand pF), homemade capacitors may
represent a low cost alternative to hard to locate expensive 'real caps'.
However, these will always be larger, bulkier, and more problematic (unless
submerged in oil or completely potted) than their commercial counterparts.
<p>
While not very practical for high uF value caps, most coaxial cable can
withstand more than 3 kV (at DC).  RG58 (50 ohm) is mostly 100 pF per meter
while RG59 (75 ohm) tends to be 67 pF meter.  Coax using high density
polyethylene (rather than foam) may be able to withstand 15 kV or more
A similar type is used to attach HeNe laser heads to their power supplies
(and it must withstand the starting voltage).  So suitable lengths of coaxial
cable (all that old network or video cable sitting above the ceiling tiles at
work!) might be useful for experimenting.  However, wrapping 1,000 meters of
old cable inside your HeNe laser power supply to obtain the needed capacitance
probably isn't too great an idea! :)
<p>
To achieve high capacitance, you need metal plates separated by as thin an
insulator as possible - but one that won't break down under the stress of the
maximum voltage applied.  Capacitance is proportional to plate area and
dielectric constant of the separator material, and inversely proportional to
the distance between the plates.
<p>
Common printed circuit board stock - Fiberglass Epoxy - is good for about
1 kV/mil (1 mil = .001 inch) of thickness.  Plexiglas acrylic has a puncture
voltage of between 450 and 990 V/mil depending on quality.  Materials like
plate glass, ceramics, and other plastics have similar ratings.  In all cases,
the quality is extremely important - a single microscopic pinhole, bubble, or
other manufacturing defect can render these ratings meaningless!
<p>
The dielectric constants of these materials can vary significantly even within
the same product family (see below).  Therefore, selection must take this into
account as well.  Less of a higher dielectric constant material may be needed
even if its puncture voltage is lower (and it thus needs to be thicker).
<p>
The <A HREF="http://www.pupman.com/howto/MATH.TXT">Information on Building
Capacitors Page</A> (part of the <A HREF="http://www.pupman.com/">Tesla Coil
Mailing List Web Site</A> has information on the dielectric constants and
puncture voltages of common materials as well as useful equations for
designing home-built high voltage capacitors.
<p>
(Portions from: Dustin Lang (dlang@cln.etc.bc.ca).)
<p>
The basic parallel plate capacitor formula is:
<PRE>
                      A * K * 8.85 pF/m
                 C = ------------------- * (N - 1)
                              d
</PRE>
Where:
<ul>
  <li>C is the resulting capacitance in pF.
  <li>A is area of the plates in square meters.
  <li>K is the dielectric constant.
  <li>8.85 pF/m is the permittivity of a vacuum.
  <li>d is plate separation in meters.
  <li>N is the number of plates.
</ul>
Some approxiate values for K: Epoxy - 3.3 to 3.7 (Fiberglass Epoxy PCB
material may be higher); Glass - 3.7 to 9.5; Plexiglas - 2.8 to 3.1.
(Source: CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics).
<p>
As an example: For a 1000 pF, 10 kV capacitor (typical of what might be
needed for the output filter capacitor of a small high compliance inverter
type HeNe laser power supply), you will need an insulator at least 10 mils
thick. Using a piece of 1/8" thick Plexiglas (about 3 mm), we have: d = 0.003
m, C = 1.0E-19 F, assume K = 3.0.  Solving for A we get:
<PRE>
                  C * d         1000 pF * 0.003 m
        A = ---------------- = ------------------- = .113 square meters
             (K * 8.85pF/m)      3.0 * 8.85 pF/m
</PRE>
which means you'll need foil about 34 x 34 cm on a piece of Plexiglas
slightly larger to provide a border to prevent air breakdown along the edges
(only about 25 V/mil for air!).  Or, several smaller capacitors in series (you
can share adjacent plates by interleaving connections - e.g., 5 plates (17 x
17 cm) on 4 pieces of slightly larger Plexiglas).
<p>
Using a piece of .010" Fiberglass Epoxy instead (good for 10 kV), the required
area would be reduced by more than a factor of 10.  This material, which is
readily available from PC board manufacturing companies, is excellent for
these capacitors and for general high voltage insulation as well.  It can be
procured bare in which case you add your own aluminum foil plates, or copper
clad, in which case the perimeter border needs to be removed.  This can be
accomplished by etching (messy chemicals) or by scribing along the edge of the
desired plate area (taking care not to damage the underlying material) and
then pealing away the unwanted copper.
<p>
To prevent accidental contact, cover it on both sides with additional LARGER
insulating plates and clamp or tape the entire assembly!
<p>
Connections to copper can be made by soldering, taking care not to damage the
substrate (raise a tab if necessary).  For aluminum foil, fine wires can be
inserted between the foil and insulator which will remain in place once the
protective covers are fastened in place.
<p>
There is supposed to be a type of Mylar (from
<A HREF="http://www.dupont.com/">Dupont</A>) that has a dielectric breakdown
of 18 kV - over 20 times that of your typical plastic or glass!
<p>
(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
That is a somewhat higher breakdown rating than is commonly tossed about. This
rating would likely be for the specific material that Dupont produces
especially for capacitor construction, which may be very difficult to obtain
in small quantities. Although, I have seen a similar material available
(surplus) in 32 gauge (0.00795" I think) thickness, but only at 3 inches in
width. The more commonly available Mylar (polyethylene terphthalate) is
usually considered safe to hold off 7,500 volts per mil. How thin you can
actually find this material, that would also be commonly available, would be
interesting to find out.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhvc2">Series Banks of Capacitors</A></h3>

Electrolytic capacitor voltage ratings are limited to 450 to 500 V but it is
often the case that filtering must be provided for multi-kV power supplies.
Just connecting electrolytic capacitors in series may result in a bomb :-(.
<p>
Polyester and other non-electrolytic capacitors may be more readily available
in lower voltage ratings as well.  Failure of these types is also possible
(though probably less spectacular).
<p>
(Note that microwave oven high voltage capacitors represent a low hassle
alternative to piles of smaller capacitors where modest capacitance (around
1 uF) at 2,500 to 3,500 VDC is required.  Of course, these can also be wired
in parallel or series to provide increased capacitance or voltage ratings.
For series banks, these are treated as non-electrolytic types.)
<p>
When capacitors are connected in series, if one fails shorted, the rest will
likely follow in rapid succession. I hope your power supply is fused!  This
somewhat undesirable behavior is a result of two effects:
<ul>
<li>There will always be at least slightly unequal DC leakage currents through
  the capacitors.  High leakage parts will see less voltage overstressing
  lower leakage parts.
<p>
  Current balancing resistors are added to compensate for unequal DC leakage
  currents.
<p>
<li>In addition, AC (fast dV/dt from turn-on, turn off, pulsed discharge, high
  ripple) will result in an unequal voltage distribution inversely related to
  unequal capacitance.  For AC, this effect will dominate even with reasonably
  sized DC current balancing resistors.  
<p>
  Matching of the capacitance of the individual parts may be necessary to
  minimize unequal AC voltage drops.
<p>
Note that if the dominant voltage across the series combination is only
DC or AC, it may be adequate to only worry about balancing that.  For example,
a filter capacitor charged from a medium to high impedance source (compared to
its reactance) will see mostly DC - the AC will be small.  Therefore, only
current balancing resistors are required.
<p>
A reasonable design approach is as follows:
<p>
<li>Provide balancing resistors to limit total current (leakage + resistor)
  differences to +/- 5%.  Select the resistor value so that current through
  it is about 10 times the maximum capacitor leakage current.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>For electrolytic capacitors, the needed balancing resistor value is best
    determined by testing each capacitor for leakage current at its rated
    voltage.
<p>
  <li>For non-electrolytic capacitors, measured leakage for a good part will
    probably be so close to zero as to be undetectable.  Therefore, just use
    resistors to provide perhaps 50 to 100 uA bypassing each capacitor.
</ul>
<p>
  CAUTION: Make any leakage current measurements in a manner that will prevent
  damage to your multimeter should the capacitor decide to short out.  For
  example, measure the voltage drop across a high value resistor in series
  with the capacitor rather then directly with the meter in series.
<p>
<li>Match capacitor uF values to within +/- 10%.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Since electrolytic capacitors often have very loose tolerances, this may
    need to be done by individual testing.
<p>
  <li>Non-electrolytic capacitors will likely be specified to this or better
    tolerance but test each one to be sure if possible.
</ul>
<p>
  If locating capacitors with this tolerance is not possible (i.e., your parts
  supply is limited), additional derating may be necessary - use additional
  capacitors in the series bank to achieve the needed voltage rating.
<p>
<li>Design the circuit with at least 50% margins so that worst case dV/dt and
  leakage current doesn't result in an explosion.  In other words, if your
  maximum expected voltage (assuming high line voltage AND possibly using the
  power supply on a Variac capable of 120% input) is Vo, rate your capacitor
  bank for at least 1.50 Vo.
</ul>
The following assumes the use of electrolytic capacitors rated at 450 V that
may have been sitting around for a few years.  Reforming can be omitted for
fresh ones.  However, in general, I would not recommend the use of old
electrolytic capacitors if possible since their characteristics will be less
stable in the long run even if you can bring them back to some sort of health.
<p>
When electrolytic capacitors sit around unused, they deteriorate and their
leakage current increases.  Reforming is accomplished by slowing bringing the
voltage across the capacitor up to its rated value (and possibly slightly
beyond) while limiting the current to a safe value.  Initially, there may be
high leakage through the capacitor but as it reforms, this will drop down to
near zero.  If current limiting is not provided, this may also result in a
bomb or smoke grenade.
<p>
(From: Charles Mosher (ratranch@svpal.org).)
<p>
In series, each must be shunted by an appropriate equalizing resistor, in
order that the variations in their leakage currents will not cause problems
with grossly unequal voltage division across them.
<p>
Form up well all the capacitors to 525 Volts if you can, and then check them
individually for leakage current at 450 Volts.  Choose the shunting resistor
value to pass perhaps 10 times this current.  Watch out for cooling in the
resistors; since little heat sinking will be provided, and in light of the
applied voltage and the nominal voltage rating of the resistors, you may want
2 W molded carbon resistors, run at no more than perhaps 1/2 watt dissipation,
in order that they be reliable.
<p>
You may have to discard some of the capacitors due to excessive leakage
current or complete failure to reform.
<p>
Remember to place insulating sleeves on the cans of the capacitors whose
negative sides are not grounded, as there is really no insulation provided
between the capacitor negative electrode in the capacitor guts and the can
itself.
<p>
Such a capacitor bank may have to be brought up to rated voltage slowly after
prolonged non-use because of uneven deforming of the electrolytics.  You might
have to repeat the whole selection process.  I built such a thing about two

The voltage rating of a resistor is not something that you tend to think about
until one fails.  However, resistors DO have voltage ratings - and they are
often less than you might think (or desire).  The typical voltage rating for
a common resistor - whether it be 1/4 W or 2 W - is often only 300 to 500 V,
but possibly as high as 1,000 V.  This is grossly inadequate for use in the
starting circuitry of HeNe laser power supplies and even for bleeder or
equalizing components in some cases.
<p>
Not only can arcing take place across inadequately rated resistors, internal
damage can occur which may not show up immediately.  Unfortunately, catalogs
may not list voltage ratings of resistors.
<p>
There are basically two options to obtain resistors with adequate voltage
ratings:
<ul>
<li>Purchase resistors designed for high voltage applications.  These will be
 physically large (though the wattage may not be important to you) and
 constructed in such a way as to withstand voltages that would arc over or
 destroy conventional carbon or film types.  Check out companies like
 <A HREF="http://www.caddock.com/">Caddock</A>,
 <A HREF="http://www.ohmcraft.com/">OhmCraft</A>,
 <A HREF="http://www.victoreen.com/">Victoreen</A>, and
 <A HREF="http://www.vishay.com/">Vishay</A>, but don't expect them to pay
 much attention to you for an order of 5 resistors!  However, it may be
 possible obtain free samples if you explain what you're doing - and their
 lawyers don't get involved!  If this doesn't work out, electronics surplus
 outfits occasionally come up with odd lots of strange components such as
 these and they even show up on eBay from time-to-time.
<p>
 However, Michael West (<A HREF="mailto:WestMBAKR@aol.com">WestMBAKR@aol.com),
 an applications engineer for <A HREF="http://www.victoreen.com/">Victoreen,
 LLC</A>, has offered to answer serious resistor related questions via email.
<p>
<li>Make your own high voltage resistor(s) from series strings of conventional
 types.  Realistically, this is probably the approach with the least hassle.
 However, the construction DOES need to take into account requirements for
 high voltage insulation - adequate spacing; the rounding off/smoothing of all
 wire ends, terminals, and connections; and possibly conformal coating of the
 entire assembly especially where the very high starting voltages are
 involved. A variety of mounting techniques can be used including soldering
 end-to-end installed in a plastic or glass tube, and on or between pieces of
 perf-board.
<p>
For example:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>If you need a 10M isolation resistor which must withstand 10 kV, use ten
    1M, 1 W resistors in series (and even this may exceed the maximum voltage
    rating of many types of resistors).
<p>
  <li>For ballast resistors, it is better to use five 15K, 2 W resistors in
    series than a single 75K, 10 W resistor.  At least part of the ballast
    resistor string needs to be mounted fairly close to the HeNe tube anode
    to minimize stray capacitance.  However, you can experiment with
    alternative placement for a portion of it to simplify mounting and to
    reduce heat dissipation near the tube.
<p>
    Note that at the instant the tube starts, there may be much more than the
    steady state voltage across the resistors.  This actual value will depend
    on how much capacitance there is in the starting circuit and how it is
    distributed but may be as much as the maximum starting voltage minus the
    tube voltage.  However, everyone ignores this and it doesn't seem to
    matter in practice. :)
</ul>
<p>
  Some types of resistors are better than others in standing up to both the
  high voltages and high peak currents at startup.  The author of the short
  paper "Wedding Lasers to Power Supplies" [16] who is a cofounder of
  LaserDrive, Inc. (a major manufacturer of laser power supplies), recommends 
  Hot molded carbon composition type but suggests that some wirewound types
  also work well.  He suggest avoiding non-hot molded carbon composition,
  highly inductive wirewound (which will increase dropout current, and film
  types (which may degrade due to the transient current of the starting
  pulse).  On the other hand, the
  <A HREF="http://www.mi-lasers.com/elden.html">HeNe Laser Manual by Elden
  Peterson</A> suggests that wirewound types are best.  In reality, if you
  use conservative design, many types will be just fine.  Additional ballast
  resistor info can be found in
  <A HREF="http://www.powertechnology.com/Techlib/ballast.asp">Power
  Technology's What is a Ballast Resistor and Why Should I Use One?</A>
  technical note.
<p>
  Some additional comments:
<p>
  (From: Greg Menke <gmenke@abs.net>
<p>
  You can get really capable HV resistors, I imagine they can end up being very
  expensive however.  I looked at a few databooks we have here, and there is a
  wide selection, but they appear mostly custom or manufactured on demand type
  devices.
<p>
  Stringing resistors together is a good alternative but can be a little tricky
  because you must stay within the dielectric rating for each resistor or it
  breaks down, plus you have to manage the dissipation as well.  I'm using 2
  parallel sets of 30 series resistors as a HV bleeder on my 30 kV capacitor.
  At 30 kV, each resistor should be dissipating .4 watts, they are rated for
  1/2 W, so I *shouldn't* need an oil bath for them.  Actually it was pretty
  hard to find resistors to withstand >= 1000 VDC each, regular resistors are
  rated for 200 volts or so.  Farnell had them, 'metal-glazed', good to 3 kV
  each.
</ul>
Note that all of these components must be immaculate - a little dirt or finger
grime results in a leakage path that looks like a short circuit compared to a
50 or 100 M ohm resistor!

<h3><A NAME="hpdhvtc">High Voltage Transformers</A></h3>

Building high voltage transformers is possible but it is definitely tedious
and extreme care must be taken to assure that there is no change of arcing
either from winding to core or from one layer to the next.  Thousands of
turns of fine wire are generally required for the HV secondary.  They have
to be arranged fairly precisely and insulating tape must be used between
layers to reduce the maximum potential between any adjacent wires to one
well below the breakdown rating for the wire.  This usually means a layer of
50 or 100 turns of wire, then a layer or two of tape, repeated 10 or 20 or
50 times.  The volume of tape may exceed that of the wire.  The wire size is
often so thin that breakage is virtually assured unless a coil winding machine
of some sort is used.  And for high frequency transformers used in inverter
power supplies, there are additional issues with respect to parasitic
capacitance.  In short (no pun....), if a suitable commercial
transformer can be used, by all means use it! :)
<p>
(From: Gernot Stoffel (Beamchief@gmx.de).)
<p>
In many cases it is recommended to connect mains transformer output
of AC HeNe power supplies a well defined way, and do some additional
grounding efforts: First, I suggest grounding both the transformer iron core
AND the negative (cathode) tube connector, each by 220K resistor or so;
or at least couple them by a 470K resistor.
<p>
Second, the tranformer pin connected with the *inner* part of secondary
coil ALWAYS should be connected next to cathode ground potential of
the entire circuitry!  (E.g., when using a typical voltage-doubling
Greinacher circuit, the two diodes should be connected to the outer end
of coil, not the inner one, because this diode potential is
oscillating with double transformer peak voltage relative to cathode ground,
while the other pin, between those two chains of elcaps, stays just at
a stable DC potential, apart from some ripple they work against.)
<p>
Reason is that before glow discharge gets ignited, the extended high
voltage (up to 10 KV or so) tends to "spray" into the air from any
part that's not properly insulated (mostly: ballast resistors). This
parasitic discharge circuit gets closed by complement spray discharges
- mostly inside the transformer. (Effect might continue even at regular tube
working, on a much lower "parasitic" level.) Thus, it's ALWAYS better
to connect it the described way, keeping voltages between core and
coil as low as ever possible, and to make defined potentials by using
the recommended grounding resistors.  (Note, the little
switching-transformers of DC drivers normally have similar preferences,
too.)
<p>
Not knowing this, my personal laser GAU was in the early nineties when
all of a sudden my fine 10 mW "handmade" NEC was striking, just five
minutes before an important presentation on a varnishing in Bonn. I
found the big's mains high voltage trafo output coil being completely
dead.  Removing iron core (fortunately, it was not a :(( welded type),
then 5,000+ turns of (too) fine wire (fortunately, it nearly was *not*
baked together with PU fluid; just that tiny little bit I had to use a
saw against, to get secondary coil finally removed VERY sensitive), I
found its innermost filaments highly eroded, in an absolute ridiculous
way, if that had not been so bad. Nevertheless, trafo had a good,
solid two-chamber insulating frame made of thick glass whisker
composite nylon that was not damaged as much one could see! (That's no
criterion; for sure.)  What had happened???
<p>
I use a hand-made case from clear Plexodur (a slightly yellowish
derivate of Plexiglas, but without its severe disadvantages, that is
brittleness and an outstanding bad chemical sensitivity, e. g., getting
into handy pieces by alcohol). It's *absolutely* nice-looking, for
that machine is covered with well-done technics and mechanics up to
the very top (take you some exciting photo seria as far I've chosen my
next digicam, what's a *long* story on its own); and it's handy, too.
But naturally, I had to darken its 14-inch laser tube, to prevent
discharge from blinding the whole audience when running; for I don't
build tricky laser deflectors just for *that*.  So, totally coated it
with two layers of matt black car spray paint a very careful way and
baked it in. (Remember, just the naked tube once made a 1000 $ charge;
meaning an entice car load of raw eggs was peanuts against). Tested
and calculated before, that this would not effect tube temperature
behavior in an intolerably bad way. (Could be proved later-on; while
self-adhesive black foil is much worse, by causing heat build-up; by
not covering the whole thing; and by highly uncertain long-time
stability risks. My beloved Contax all goes into parts just because
its glue re-transforms to cosmical dust.)  What I did *not* know then,
nor expect in any way, was that these black paint sprays *all* are
conductive a tiny little bit, by using soot particles for
pigment. (Tried nearly ten brands of spray varnish later to avoid this
disadvantage; but it's all nearly the same, beside a factor of three
or so.)  But learned it quite fast, for tube ignition behavior was
lousy; so I freed the zones directly around tube-connector passes from
paint and extra-insulated them by epoxy-filled, black caps, taken from
wonder-glue flasks. (So, this is just another thing best *never*
thrown away.)  Igniting behavior grew much better, but by far was not
perfect; noticed that tube surface still got highly charged during
ignition. Hmmm.  Fixed the whole problem the "sledgehammer way" then
with an extra circuitry, made by a tiny, gas-filled 350 V / 5 kA
spark discharger item and a "bullet-proof" 10 nf 630 V capacitor,
contacting it by a five-bucks-rhodium-plated-gold-blinking spring
contact pin and holder to the tube's central copper collar I made
there, fairly under the paint, for proper temperature taking, and
ground. During ignition, capacitor now got charged within a second or
so, TICK!, discharger ignited with some pretty hundred Amps and little
blue spark, and kicked the whole tube discharge a proper way (ask Sam
why it did). Truly clever, I thought. Even a touch better than using a
piezo lighter module a similar way. Worked fine.
<p>
Until the transformer was dead, several years later, the described way. Then
it was not clever any more, not at all.
<p>
The simple, very obvious and primitive truth is that the metal ends of
the tube are connected to the inner voltage(s) as well - lately by the
ion discharge! -, especially that one near the anode pin; and so the
conducting tube surface was still rather contacted with it. AND the
truth was that the transformer output coil by natural means was switched
just the opposite way than it would have been able to bear that
problem. (As usual, Murphy had done his very best.)
<p>
Well - the rest was easy work: Insulated those tube ends, by first
another time carefully removing the white silicone caps as I did
several times before, e. g. for fine-optimizing the resonator
alignment the adequate way it *can* be done at operating NEC tubes if
you really know what you're doing, then by using short sections of
black shrinking tube covering the removed ring zones of paint, and
re-monted the end-caps. Dark as hell.  AND I re-assembled the transformer,
after professional efforts to improve wiring-cabin (frame) insulation:
knowing the primarily-coil number of turns (had been cool enough
measuring ten testing turns, manually threaded to that dead transformer
before slaughtering, so there was no need to remove/move the core
twice, thus putting 75 pieces of thin metal at alternating
orientations), by that simply fixed the number of needed secondary
coil turns, then calculated optimum wire diameter (0.15 mm) to fill
the frame (3.3 times better and twice stable than it was before (0.1
mm)); attended 0.2 kg = 1,220 m of this stuff (needing about 850 m, I
knew); and *then*, turn beside turn, layer onto layer, with some
additional cross-section insulating efforts I made that new coil
manually, 5,375 turns, meaning 21,500 well-guided frame corners, forty
layers, just assisted by a little mechanical turn-counter I had put to
my wiring "machine" made of 'Fischertechnik' construction kit. Lasted
two days or so. Blocked the whole transformer frame with thin, clear epoxy
sealing compound at the end, using good vacuum to get any gas away during that
procedure, and then re-assembled transformer core. So now it will work
properly even at the bottom of Marian trench, if cable is long enough.
Since then there is no problem any more.
<p>
OK: Cold tube does not ignite very proper (lost function of my fine
ignition "sledgehammer", by finally insulating the tube coating from
discharge voltages an effective way); but lately *does*.
<p>
(Conclusion: HeNe tubes definitely *don't* like conducting black paint, in
terms of their ignition behaviour, but just want to show all they got.)

<b>Question:</b> Which wire diameter 'd' shall I take to fill a chambered
transformer frame cavity quite proper, when 'n' turns are wanted?
A needless thin wire type is bad, for increasing resistance,
heat-up etc., and often is uncomfortable to practice, too; and too
thick wire type does not fit the problem, but is one of the ugliest
ways to restart work. And guessing is <i>no</i> method for getting proper
results here.
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> When the wiring cabin (frame) cavity is 'w' wide and 'h' high
(at any side), usable area is A=w*h.  Total (!) maximum wire diameter
then is d:&lt;=1,075*sqrt(A/n), when coil gets wound turn by turn, layer
onto layer.  By winding a transformer coil not <i>that</i> exact way (but not
extremely crowded!), a safety margin of about -5% in diameter is quite
sufficient (because space grows as the square with diameter; so this
will yield about 10% additional space: 0.95<sup>2</sup>=0.9025). So
you then get d:&lt;=1.02*sqrt(A/n).  Or make it easy: d:&lt;=sqrt(A/n).
Wire diameter usually gets specified without the insulation coating.
A single coating adds about 0.03 mm to the wire diameter, a double coating
adds 0.05 mm.  Thus, you have to subtract this from your total result, and
then take the next available diameter same or below this value. You always
will be on safe ground.
<p>
(Taking all dimensions in mm, the result is in mm, too.)
<p>
[Proof: With a cross-sectional area 'A' and 'n' turns, each one has
maximum space 'A/n' to use. Nearly all wires are in a hexagonal grid
(if no left-handed gorilla made that coil), where wire diameter is the
side-to-side diameter 'd' of such hexagon.  A little geometry sketch
shows, on just a hundred different ways, that hexagonal area is then
sqrt(3)*d<sup>2</sup>/2. So with A/n&gt;=sqrt(3)*d<sup>2</sup>/2 you get
d:&lt;=sqrt(A/n)*sqrt(sqrt(4/3)). This factor is about 1.075.]
<p>
<i><b>Important:</b></i> If you wind high-voltage coils, an endless
job requiring perfect precision all the time, you may need additional
insulating foils between layers. Then substract another 10% from wire
diameter before selecting it, and it's best to use double-coated type if you
can get it.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Which length of wire do I approximately need with that
nearly-optimum diameter?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> When frame chamber kernel is x*y, average length of any turn
is (2*(x+y)+h*pi. ('h*pi' is the net turn length around all the four
corners.) By this, total wire length is about n*(2*(x+y)+pi*h).
<p>
(Taking all dimensions in mm, result is in mm, too.)
<p>
Note: This is the absolute maximum length which can occur, beside of
some additional cm for connecting.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhvc4">Power Supply Construction Considerations</A></h3>

Since these power supplies generate high voltage, you cannot simply use the
same wiring practices as for 5 V TTL computer logic!
<p>
<ul>
<li>HeNe laser power supplies are dangerous!  Never underestimate the stupidity
 of even knowledgeable people when it comes to technology.  High voltages will
 be present (possibly for some time after the unit is powered down or
 unplugged) and line voltage will be present in some designs.
<ul>
 <li>Fully enclose the unit in an insulated (plastic) or grounded (metal) box
  to keep out curious fingers.
<p>
 <li>For AC line powered types, all exposed metal parts, including those of
  the laser head, should be earth-grounded.  Use a three wire grounded line
  cord plugged into a properly grounded outlet.
<p>
 <li>For low voltage DC powered inverter types, earth-grounding isn't needed
  for safety as long as exposed metal parts are grounded to the power supply
  common.  However, a metal box or copper foil shielding may be desirable if
  the laser is to be used near low level circuitry - these devices can
  generate a fair amount of radio frequency interference.
<p>
 <li>Include bleeder resistors on the high voltage filter capacitors where
  possible to safely drain their charge within a few seconds of powering
  down.  (Such bleeders are rarely put on the actual output which includes
  the starting voltage because they would have to be of too high a resistance
  value (Giga Ohms) due to the low current availability of the typical
  voltage multiplier to be practical.  Fortunately, the charged stored in
  such circuits is small enough to be only mildly annoying!)
<p>
 <li>Arrange to have the cathode of the HeNe tube tied directly to the case
  if possible or at least via a high value (e.g., 10 M ohm) resistor.  This
  will eliminate one source of lingering charge after shutdown (between the
  anode and cathode, and the case) and may help starting as well (due to the
  capacitance between the anode and the case).
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
The input side doesn't present too many problems:
<p>
<ul>
<li>AC line circuitry can use normal hookup wire with insulation rated for at
 least 600 V.
<p>
<li>Inverter drive circuitry should be constructed on a suitable circuit board
 (perforated, prototyping, or PCB) to minimize wire length and capacitance.
<p>
<li>Provide the appropriate power switch, fuse, power-on indicator, and other
 safety and convenience related primary side components.
</ul>
<p>
However, there are special concerns for the secondary side.  For higher power
(higher voltage) HeNe tubes, these are even more critical for both safety and
consistent performance:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The high voltage circuitry should use wire with insulation rated for at
 least 2X of the maximum expected voltage at each point, be constructed on
 perforated circuit board material, a printed circuit board, or use rigid
 wire and air insulation.
<p>
 Keep components adequately spaced from each other, and grounds or the case,
 where voltages differ substantially.  Maintain separation of at least 1 inch
 per 10 kV though more is better.  Or, include additional insulation such as
 a sheet of Plexiglas or other plastic, or Fiberglass-Epoxy printed circuit
 board material (without copper or copper on only one side if that side is
 grounded).
<p>
<li>The positive output to the ballast resistor/anode of the HeNe tube must use
 wire with insulation rated for at least 20 kV.  Non-resistive type automotive
 ignition cable and TV or monitor CRT HV cable work well in this application.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Non-resistive type automotive ignition cable is NOT the type you will
  likely find in your Chevy (which probably has a high resistance core to
  suppress ignition RFI).  What you want has a metallic wire core - testing
  with an ohmmeter should show near zero resistance.  Try a high performance
  engine rebuild or specialty auto shop.
<p>
 <li>The fat wire coming off of the flyback (LOPT) or voltage multiplier of any
  color TV or computer monitor will work fine - try your local repair shop
  (or your attic).  And, the rest of the unit may come in handy as well. :-)
 </ul>
<p>
 These are both significantly overrated for the laser applications but are
 also quite robust and resistant to high temperatures and mechanical abuse.
<p>
<li>Make sure everything is immaculate.  A little dirt or finger grime results
 in a leakage path that looks like a short circuit compared to the typical
 effective series impedance of a starting multiplier!
<p>
<li>Where the starting voltages are involved (in particular since they are more
 than 5 kV and circuits like multipliers are usually capable of only very low
 current), sharp edges on terminals and wires should be removed by smoothing
 with a fine file and/or sandpaper.  Brush or vacuum to remove any metal
 particles.  Then, use extra solder to produce a rounded surface on all
 connections.  Otherwise, there can be corona effects which may result in
 erratic, poor, or no starting depending on temperature and humidity.
 Finally, thoroughly clean with alcohol to remove all contamination.  The
 extra few minutes these steps require may save hours of aggravation later
 on - especially when driving higher power HeNe tubes!
<p>
<li>Once the power supply has been perfected, further insulating the circuitry,
 with a conformal coating such as multiple layers of spray-on high voltage
 sealer is will further minimize starting problems due to environmental
 conditions.  Potting the voltage multiplier (or at least the last few stages)
 is even better but I prefer to avoid doing something that may not be
 reversible!
<p>
 There is special RTV Silicone formulated for high voltage applications.  The
 normal bathtub caulk or window sealer may corrode the circuitry (if it
 smells like vinegar) or may degrade (decompose, become discolored) after
 some amount of time resulting in conductive paths.  I have used the clear
 GE stuff apparently without problems on the HeNe laser power supply I
 routinely use for testing but your mileage may vary.
<p>
 CAUTION: Know the limits of your power supply.  Ironically, being too
 successful at insulating the starting voltage can overstress marginally
 specified components which would normally be protected because the voltage
 never got high enough to exceed their ratings!
<p>
<li>It is always a good idea to include some resistance in series with the
 positive output of the power supply even if the ballast resistor is in the
 laser head.  A 10K, 2 W flameproof resistor (of adequate voltage rating,
 see below) will protect the supply from accidental short circuits (e.g.,
 the diodes in voltage multiplier starting circuits).  It will also prevent
 instant destruction of the HeNe tube should you forget the ballast resistor
 on a grossly overrated supply! :-(.
<p>
 WARNING: This resistor does NOT reduce the danger from the supply - it is to
 protect the equipment.  The available current can still be lethal.
<p>
<li>Speaking of resistors, those used in the high voltage circuitry need to be
 rated for high voltage (as well as the maximum power dissipation).  We
 normally do not think about voltage ratings for resistors (at least not
 since the good old days of vacuum tube equipment!) but in this case it is
 critical.  Common resistors may be rated for only a few hundred volts each
 (this depends on physical size/wattage and type of construction - e.g.,
 carbon, metal film, etc.).  You might push this to 500 V or even 1 kV but
 going beyond this is definitely asking for trouble.
<p>
 There are special resistors designed for use in high voltage circuits and
 these would be best.  However, series strings of lower value resistors
 should be acceptable with proper construction techniques.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhvc3">High Voltage Resistors</A> for more
 information.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="hpdhvc5">Separating Power Supply and HeNe Tube or Laser Head</A></h3>

For most applications, a short cable between the power supply and HeNe tube
or laser head is acceptable but suppose you want to have 20 feet between them?
<p>
You can extend the cable all you want as long as:
<ul>
<li>Most of the ballast resistance is close to the HeNe tube.
<p>
<li>The starter is either located with the HeNe tube or is a DC type (voltage
  multiplier, inverter, etc.).  Pulse type starters are going to be ineffective
  with any sort of cable length due to stray capacitance.  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns">Starters - Voltage Multiplier, Pulse,
  Inverter, Piezo</A>.
</ul>
Of course, use cable rated for much more voltage than can be supplied by your
starter.  Don't just go by the starting voltage rating of the HeNe tube - if it
should become disconnected, the full starting voltage will be present, possibly
for an extended period of time!

<h2>Starters - Voltage Multiplier, Pulse, Inverter, Piezo</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hpdhns0">Starting Circuits for HeNe Laser Tubes</A></h3>

The objective is to achieve the required breakdown voltage of the laser tube
and then disappear into the woodwork.  Almost no energy is required - just
voltage.  Therefore, any method that can achieve this will be adequate.
Conceivably, even walking across a wool carpet on a dry day and touching the
anode of the tube would make a suitable starting procedure (perhaps assuming
you don't die from the high voltage - this depends on *your* requirements).
However, higher tech approaches are usually preferred. :-)  In fact, the piezo
assembly from a disposable lighter or gas grill can be used as the basis for a
starting circuit.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns13">Piezo Impulse Starting Circuits</A>.
<p>
Although usually specified by tube manufacturers to be 7 kV to 12 kV depending
on size, the actual starting voltage is often much less, typically only 3 to 5
times the operating voltage.  However, to be sure, adhering to the minimum
starting voltage specifications is still a good idea unless you intend to only
use one tube and test it before constructing your power supply.
<p>
Here are many possibilities for starting HeNe tubes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Use a 'parasitic' voltage multiplier.  This is an n-stage diode-capacitor
 ladder operating off of the (unfiltered) output of the primary supply.  This
 can be used on both high frequency inverters and line powered systems though
 component values will differ.  Since starting the tube requires essentially
 no current, the capacitors are small in either case.  The voltage multiplier
 goes essentially in series with the operating supply and is effectively
 shorted out once the tube fires.
<p>
 A voltage multiplier can be constructed from common diodes and capacitors
 relatively easily.  Alternatively, a 3X or 4X type may be purchased as a
 replacement for the type found in some color TVs and monitors - you may
 even have one gathering moss in your junk box!
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns1">Voltage Multiplier Starting
 Circuits</A>.
<p>
<li>Use a trigger transformer such as found in a photographic strobe to pulse
 the tube.  Its secondary (usually in conjunction with some high voltage
 diodes) would go in series with the positive side of the main supply.
 A push button can be used to start the tube or a simple automatic circuit
 which senses that there is no tube current flowing can do it for you.
 However, a much larger trigger transformer than found in a disposable
 pocket camera will likely be needed to start it in one shot.  A small TV or
 monitor flyback transformer or automotive ignition coil can also be used.
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns4">Starting Circuits Using
 Pulse or Flyback Transformers</A>".
<p>
 The spark generating modules used in electric stove or furnace igniters,
 and pocket lighters that use a capacitive discharge approach would also
 work with few additional parts (a pair of HV diodes).  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns8">HeNe Starter Using Electronic Ignition (or
 Other Similar) Modules</A>.
<p>
<li>Use an inverter based on the flyback transformer from a small B/W TV, video
 monitor, or computer terminal.  The output goes in series with the main
 supply but is bypassed by a HV blocking diode.  It is activated only when
 starting the HeNe tube.  While the inverter must produce a very high
 voltage, the required power is negligible, so the drive circuit can be very
 simple, a one transistor blocking oscillator, for example.  However,
 getting such a circuit to work well is something of an art.  An easier,
 though somewhat more complex design, uses a 555 timer to drive a bipolar
 power transistor or MOSFET.  An even easier, if somewhat inelegant solution,
 is to rip the horizontal deflection/HV guts out of a computer terminal,
 monitor, or TV. :-)  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns12">Sam's
 Super-Starter(tm)</A>.  I guarantee that if the HeNe tube is good, no
 matter how large, this WILL start it!
<p>
 These approaches work particularly well for hard-to-start tubes because up
 to 16 kV or more is available and mostly enclosed (inside the flyback
 potting material if it has an internal rectifier).  Thus, problems with
 corona from external wiring are minimized.
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns4">Starting Circuits Using
 Pulse or Flyback Transformers</A>, for more information.
<p>
<li>Use the piezo assembly from a disposable lighter or gas grill as a source
 of a high voltage pulse.  The only additional parts required are a pair
 of high voltage rectifiers.  This will require pushing a button to start
 the tube but is by far the simplest approach in terms of the number of
 required parts.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns12">Piezo
 Impulse Starting Circuits</A>.
<p>
<li>Implement a wide compliant range constant current supply as described with
 respect to the Linear Technology application note (AN-49, above).  Until
 the tube fires, the supply will attempt to increase the voltage (within
 its compliance range) until current starts flowing.  Also see the section:
 <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsgi">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power
 Supplies</A>.
<p>
<li>It should be possible to start HeNe tubes having a bare capillary such as
 those used in large frame external mirror lasers in the same manner as is
 used to trigger xenon flashlamps - by attaching a pulse starter via a short
 lead (a few inches at most) to a wire or piece of foil wrapped around the
 thin bore of the HeNe tube.  The capacitive coupling enables the starting
 pulse to directly ionize the gas in the bore allowing current to flow from
 the main supply.  This approach may work in some cases with small internal
 mirror HeNe tubes with wide diameter gas reservoirs surrounding the bore as
 well.   However, getting the gas in the central bore of such a tube to ionize
 in this manner will be a lot more difficult since it is much further away.
 It may even be possible to just attach it to the anode of the tube (after the
 ballast resistors) but this is less likely to be reliable if it works at all.
<p>
 On some internal mirror HeNe tubes or laser heads, you may find a wire or
 conductive strip running from the anode or ballast resistor down to a loop
 around the tube in the vicinity of the cathode.  (Or there may be a
 recommendation for this in a tube spec sheet.)  This external wire loop is
 supposed to aid in starting (probably where a pulse type starter is involved)
 in a similar manner to what is used for an external capillary (above).
 However, with an internal mirror HeNe tube, the capillary is usually isolated
 from the outside envelope.  Therefore, I wouldn't expect there to be much, if
 any, benefit especially when using a modern power supply, but it might help
 in marginal cases.  And, running the high voltage along the body of the tube
 requires additional insulation and provides more opportunity for bad things
 to happen (like short circuits) and may represent an additional electric
 shock hazard.
</ol>
<p>
For a basic AC line powered supply, I recommend the parasitic multiplier
approach (1) as it can be constructed from readily available inexpensive
components: 1N4007s (about 5 cents each) and .001 uF, 1,000 V ceramic disc
capacitors (about 10 cents each).  Depending on the number of stages in the
multiplier, between 6 and 28 of each of these components will be required.
<p>
Of course, you can also use higher voltage diodes and capacitors to simplify
the construction but they will probably be much more costly.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg1">Sam's Small Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL1)</A> for a
tested design using inexpensive parts.
<p>
Alternatively, a commercial voltage multiplier block can be used.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns3">Color TV or Monitor Voltage Multiplier</A>.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns1">Voltage Multiplier Starting Circuits</A></h3>

These are called 'parasitic multipliers' since they feeds off of the main
supply and are only really active during starting when no current is flowing
in the HeNe tube.
<p>
A voltage multiplier can be constructed from common diodes and capacitors
relatively easily.  Alternatively, a 3X or 4X type may be purchased as a
replacement for the type found in some color TVs and monitors - you may even
have one gathering moss in your junk box!  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns3">Color TV or
Monitor Voltage Multiplier</A>.
<p>
A typical design with 7 diodes (3-1/2 stages) is shown below.  For small
tubes, fewer stages can be used.  Going much beyond n=7 or 8 (4 stages) is
probably not useful as the losses from diode and stray capacitance and leakage
will limit output.

</PRE>
Where:
<p>
<ul>
<li>X   = Input.  This is the pulsating output of the transformer.
<li>Y   = Input.  This is the DC output of the rectifier or doubler and filter.
<li>HV- = High Voltage return (this may not be system ground!)
</ul>
(Note: all the power supply schematics in this document have these points
labeled consistently.)
<p>
With n diodes, HV(peak) is approximately (X(peak) * (n + 1).)+ Y and
HV(average) is (X(peak) * n) + Y.
<p>
Note that an even number of diodes may be very slightly better since there is
less ripple on the output when the tube is running.  However, with a high
value R1 (10M) this is so small anyway that it really should not matter
and an odd number of diodes saves components but results in nearly the same
peak starting voltage.
<p>
For use in HeNe laser starting applications where no real current is required,
R1 limits power to the multiplier once the tube fires.  Power is then drawn
from point Y through the string of diodes.
<p>
Multipliers can be used with both line operated supplies and high frequency
inverters but since the capacitors must be larger at the (lower) line
frequency.
<ul>
<li>Typical capacitor values for high frequency inverter: 100 pF.
<li>Typical capacitor values for line operated supply: 250 pF to .001 uF.
</ul>
The uF value of the caps isn't critical but it needs to be large enough so
the impedance of the caps at the operating frequency is low compared to the
leakage due to the capacitance of the diodes, stray wiring capacitance, and
non-infinite resistance of everything.  Aside from these losses, a small uF
value will just result in the starting voltage climbing more slowly and thus
the HeNe tube will take longer to start.  A large uF value will just cost
too much.
<p>
The voltage ratings of the diodes and capacitors must be greater than the
p-p output of the transformer.
<p>
Because the capacitors used in the multiplier are so small, they cannot really
supply much current.  Once the tube fires and current starts to flow, the
ladder just becomes some series diodes.  Then you're back to the basic power
supply output (rectifier or doubler and filter capacitors), with a few diodes
in series.
<p>
And to emphasize, there really is virtually <i>zero</i> added ripple from
these starters once the tube is running even if the apparnet impedance of
the components fed from the HV transformer is relatively small (e.g.,
a few M ohms).  It's not only that the current
through the capacitors is small, since this could still result in
100s of volts of ripple across the ballast+tube or regulator.
More fundamentally, it's because the forward voltage drops across the
HV diodes are nearly constant as a function of current as long as they
are conducting.  In fact, it's only the left-most HV diode of the
multiplier that really matters since most of the ripple current
will flow through it to get absorbed by the main filter capacitor
at the input to the multiplier.  The only added ripple will be due
to the non-zero slope of that HV diode's V-I curve at the operating
point, probably less than 0.1 V/mA.  On a power supply where the starter
could be turned on and off with a switch while the tube was running, the
difference in voltage ripple at the output of the multiplier was
totally undetectable with all the ripple originating from the main
filter capacitor.  However, this does mean there should be no
added resistance placed between the starter and the main filter
capacitor, as that would result in increased starter generated
ripple due to the IR drop, which is not constant.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns2">Voltage Multiplier Operation</A></h3>

Making the assumption that this circuit actually works, it is easiest to
understand its operation in the steady state with no load.  (Trying to keep
track of each of the nodes on each cycle is virtually impossible without a 
circuit analysis program.)  Ideally, in the steady state, no current will be
flowing through any of the diodes.
<p>
There are two types of nodes:
<ul>
<li>Nodes connected to the capacitors on the bottom rung of the ladder will
  have filtered (constant) DC voltage on them.
<p>
<li>Nodes connected to the capacitors on the top rung of the ladder will have
  pulsating DC voltage with the p-p voltage from X.  With no losses, the
  capacitors will pass the AC input waveform unchanged (in this simplified
  analysis).  Therefore, the waveform from X will be reproduced at each of
  these nodes.
<p>
  In order for no current to flow through the diodes:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The peak positive value of each of these nodes must not be greater than
    the DC voltage on the node to its right.
<p>
  <li>The peak negative value of each of these nodes must not be less than the
    DC voltage on the node to its left.
</ul>
</ul>
It follows from this that the voltage (DC or average) must increase by a value
of V(peak) after each diode.  Otherwise, current would be flowing on either
the negative or positive peak of the input.
<p>
Assuming a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2 units (just to keep the diagram
simple), the voltages at each node will be:

Where:
<ul>
<li>+N denotes a DC value of Y + n * V(peak).
<li>+N(AC) denotes a pulsating voltage with an average value of Y + n * V(peak)
    and a p-p value of 2 * V(peak).
</ul>
Thus, the nth diode's output has multiplied the peak value by n.  The peak
value of HV+ will actually be Y + 8 * V(peak) or about 5 times the p-p output
of the transformer.  (With one more diode and capacitor, this would be a DC
output of this same voltage.)
<p>
In practice the actual output will likely be somewhat less due to stray
capacitance and other losses.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns3">Color TV or Monitor Voltage Multiplier</A></h3>

Some color TVs and computer or video monitors do not generate the high voltage
directly from the flyback transformer.  Rather, they use a voltage multiplier
to step up 6 to 10 kVAC (from the flyback - no rectifier) to the 20 to 30 kVDC
or so required by the CRT.  If you have a pile of dead TVs or monitors rotting
in your garage, at least one may have a suitable multiplier block.  If not,
they are available for around $10 to $20 from electronics distributors dealing
in parts for the service industry (e.g., MCM Electronics, Dalbani, Premium
Parts, etc).
<p>
Since these voltage multiplier blocks are designed for horizontal deflection
(e.g., ~15.7 kHz), they are ideal for drive from an inverter.  I have also
tested two different multipliers on my line powered (60 Hz) supply without any
problems.  In fact, one of those I tried was removed from a TV because it had
a short in the focus divider network but this didn't affect HeNe tube starting
performance at all!
<p>
These are usually 3X units though some 4X types are also available.  Hooking
them up is very straightforward and the entire multiplier is well insulated
(totally potted in Epoxy) with a high voltage output lead (just remove the CRT
suction cup connector).  The unneeded terminals (e.g., F, CTL) can be ignored.
<p>
Some of these have a capacitively coupled drive input.  If this is NOT the
case, the addition of a high voltage capacitor (.001 uF, 3 kV typical) in
between the X and IN terminals is required to achieve the full multiplication
factor.  If you do not know if there is an internal capacitor, include C1 - it
will not hurt anything.  Since you do not want much current from the voltage
multiplier, insert a 1M to 10M series resistor in this path as well.

ECG535 is just one typical 3X model.  Almost any HV multiplier of this general
type will be suitable.  However, if you have a choice, obtain a 4X multiplier
as this will provide a bit more margin (though a 3X model should be adequate
for most HeNe tubes).  The IN terminal may be called GND, REF, or COM on some
models - or there may be a pair of terminals with two of these names.  If so,
they should be tied together.  F and CTL are Focus and Control respectively.
These and any other special terminals can be left unconnected.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns4">Starting Circuits Using Pulse or Flyback Transformers</A></h3>

These approaches represent alternatives to the use of a voltage multiplier.
With the auto-trigger circuit, they are equally effective (hey, if it starts,
it starts!) and may be somewhat easier to construct since fewer parts are
involved.  Some further simplification is possible if you are willing to
forgo the auto-trigger circuit and use a pushbutton switch instead of the SCR.
<p>
Note: These may be called either pulse or trigger starting circuits and I use
the terms somewhat interchangeably.
<p>
For some types of specialized or older HeNe (and other gas) lasers where there
is a separate gas reservoir and the surface of the capillary is accessible,
the output of a true pulse starting circuit (single shot, not a charge pump or
inverter since a high dV/dt pulse shape is required) may be applied to an
external electrode in a similar manner to that used for triggering a xenon
flashlamp.  The pulse circuits below may be suitable (but leave out any HV
diodes).  However, this type of laser construction is not that common and this
approach will probably not work for the inexpensive mass produced sealed HeNe
tubes with a wide glass envelope surrounding a narrow capillary since it will
be difficult to ionize the gas inside the bore in the center of the tube.
<p>
While the current required to start a HeNe tube is negligible, the energy
needed to achieve sufficient voltage given the stray capacitance of the
wiring, HeNe tube anode, and other connected components is not.  With a
voltage multiplier type starting circuit, this just means it takes a little
time to charge up to the required voltage but as long as the leakage is small
(it usually can be ignored), the tube will start eventually.  For a pulse
(trigger) type staring circuit, the energy must be provided in one shot or a
charge pump must be used to accumulate smaller energy packets.
<p>
Thus, pulse starting circuits are more effective if the wire length (and thus
the capacitance) between the power supply's final rectifier and HeNe tube
anode is minimized.
<p>
Locating a large enough pulse transformer to start the tube in one shot may
prove to be a challenge.  However, a charge pump (really, just an extra high
voltage diode or two) can be added to any of these circuits so that the energy
in each pulse can be accumulated.  The tiny trigger transformer from a
disposable pocket camera will not work very well by itself but should work
with a such a charge pump.  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns7">Pulse Starting Circuit Using
Small Flyback Transformer</A> for the charge pump configuration.
<p>
A flyback transformer from a small B/W TV or computer terminal does work quite
nicely with a charge pump.  An automotive ignition coil would probably be
large enough for single shot operation.
<p>
Replacing the pulse button with a simple transistor oscillator results in an
inverter based starting circuit.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns10">Inverter Based Starters</A> for more
information on this approach.
<p>
The first three circuits that follow differ only in the type of trigger 
transformer used but operation is otherwise identical.  These have not been
tested.
<p>
The final circuit uses a flyback transformer from a long forgotten video
display terminal and has been tested using a manual pushbutton.
<p>
Some other options using salvaged parts (or at least salvaged designs) from
household devices include:
<ul>
<li>Electronic ignition module from a gas cook-top, oven, or furnace - In fact,
 the design of some of these 'repetitive sparkers' is very similar to the
 circuits presented below.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns8">HeNe Starter Using Electronic Ignition (or
 Similar) Modules</A>.
<p>
<li>High voltage module from an electronic air cleaner or similar device - See
 the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns9">HeNe Starter Using Electronic
 Air Cleaner HV Module</A>.
<p>
<li>Piezo igniter from a gas grill or butane lighter - This a super simple
 alternative since the only required circuitry is a pair of HV diodes.  See
 the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns13">Piezo Impulse Starting
 Circuits</A>.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns5">Pulse Starting Circuit - Trigger Transformer with
 Isolated HV Winding</A></h3>

This is the basic circuit where the primary and secondary of the trigger
transformer are isolated with an insulation breakdown rating of at least
12 kV.  The major difference between this circuit and those to follow is
that it is referenced to the system common (HV-) rather than floating at
a high voltage (on one of the filter capacitors).
<p>
Operation is similar to a repeating strobe trigger.

</PRE>
The voltage divider formed by R1 and R2 charges C1 from the high voltage power
supply (Z, a lower voltage tap if possible to reduce the dissipation in R1 and
R2).  At the same time, C2 charges from R5 and R6 (this time constant is faster
than that of the relaxation oscillator).  Once the voltage across NT1 (NE2
neon tube) reaches about 90 V, NT1 breaks down dumping C1's charge through
the gate of SCR1.  This turns on and discharges C2 through T2 generating a 5
to 10 kV pulse in series with the high voltage power supply ionizing the gas
in the HeNe tube.  CR1 must be a 15 kV or greater high voltage rectifier and
prevents reverse voltage from appearing at the tube.
<p>
Should the HeNe tube not fire on the first pulse, the process repeats at about
a 2 Hz rate until current starts flowing in the tube.  A current of about 3.5
mA through the HeNe tube and R7 results in a voltage drop of .7 V across B-E
of Q1 turning it on.  This short circuits the relaxation oscillator shutting
off the starting circuit.
<p>
Component values can easily be adjusted to accommodate the specifications of
your specific power supply voltage and HeNe tube current.
<p>
These are all basically capacitive discharge ignition systems and indeed,
an automotive ignition coil may be satisfactory for the trigger transformer
where isolation is not needed!

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns6">Isolated Pulse Starting Circuits</A></h3>

The following two circuits are virtually identical.  The only difference is
whether the dots on the pulse (trigger) transformer match or oppose.  One of
these should be used when the trigger transformer shares a common lead between
the primary and secondary.
<p>
Operation for both is as follows:
<p>
The trigger capacitor, C2, charges through the voltage divider formed by R1 and
R2.  When a pulse is input to the gate of the SCR via the high voltage coupling
capacitor, C1, it triggers dumping C2 through the primary of the trigger
transformer.
<p>
WARNING: The voltage rating on C1 must be adequate - with a safety margin - for
your power supply.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns7">Pulse Starting Circuit Using Small Flyback Transformer</A></h3>

This circuit has only been tested with a manual push button.  Usually, 3 or 4
presses of the button are needed to build up the needed starting voltage via
the charge pump formed by CR1 and CR2.  These are needed because a single
press of the button may not generate enough charge to achieve the required
starting voltage.  They enable the charge to be accumulated on the stray
capacitance of the wiring, CR1, and HeNe tube anode.  The diodes should have a
PRV rating greater than the starting voltage requirement of your HeNe tube,
15,000 V should be sufficient.  This type of diode is typically used in B/W
TVs and monochrome computer monitors.  Microwave oven high voltage rectifiers
also work but not nearly as well (many more presses of the button are needed)
due probably to their higher capacitance and leakage.
<p>
Higher input voltage, more or fewer turns on the flyback, or a different
capacitor may improve response - your challenge!
<p>
The primaries on the flyback are ignored and a new one is added - 5 turns of
#20 or thicker insulated wire wound anywhere on the core where it will fit.
As long as the original primary windings are not shorted, they will not
interfere with circuit operation.
<p>
Locate the HV return and guess at the polarity - it will work properly only
one way since the output is a huge spike.  Reverse the input connections if
you cannot get the tube to fire and you think everything else is correctly
wired.
<p>
I used a separate 50 VDC power supply to drive this circuit but you can use a
tap on the main filter capacitor of the main supply as well.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns8">HeNe Starter Using Electronic Ignition (or Other Similar) Modules</A></h3>

No, not the ignition module from your 1985 Chevy - though that would probably
work at least as well. :-)
<p>
Many modern gas stoves, ovens, furnaces, and other similar appliances use an
electronic ignition rather than a continuously burning pilot flame to ignite
the fuel.  Well, guess what is in one of these modules?  That's right - a high
voltage pulse generator which is ideal for starting HeNe tubes!
<p>
The typical design is remarkably similar to that of the circuits described in
the previous sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns4">Starting
Circuits Using Pulse or Flyback Transformers</A>.  It is powered either from
115 VAC or 24 VAC and generates of a series of sparks at a rate of perhaps 1
or 2 per second.  These modules should be readily available as replacements at
your local appliance repair shop or parts supplier.
<p>
Internally, a typical 115 VAC unit consists of a simple rectifier/filter or
doubler, neon bulb relaxation oscillator triggering an SCR which dumps a
capacitor's charge into a pulse transformer - very similar to trigger circuit
of a repeating strobe.
<p>
All that is needed to convert one into a HeNe starter is a suitable power
source and a pair of HV diodes to form a charge pump (as described above).
Depending on design, it may be possible to run these from a DC power supply
or one derived from your HeNe operating voltage.
<p>
The Harper-Wyman Model 6520 Kool Lite(tm) module is typical of those found in
Jenne-Aire and similar cook-tops.  Input is 115 VAC, 4 mA, 50/60 Hz AC.  C1
and D1 form a half wave doubler resulting in 60 Hz pulses with a peak of about
300 V and at point A and charges C2 to about 300 V through D2.  R2, C3, and
DL1 form a relaxation oscillator triggering SCR1 to dump the charge built up
on C2 into T1 with a repetition rate of about 2 Hz.
<p>
Based on the 10 kV or so output of this module, I estimate that T1 has a
step-up turns ratio of about 35:1 but have no easy way of determining the
exact number of turns since it is potted in clear plastic.  Fortunately, the
primary side of the circuit was accessible after prying off the bottom cover
plate.  My totally wild guess is that the primary and secondary are about 25
and 900 turns respectively.

For use on DC, remove C1 (and D1, D2, and R2 if you like - they won't affect
anything) and provide about 300 V from your HeNe operating supply (typically
from point A of the schematics shown in the chapter <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe Laser Power

Some types of lighters generate a spark in a very similar manner.  The guts
from these may be pressed into service as HeNe starters (a much more noble
cause than their original application, I might add!) with the addition of a
couple of HV diodes.  One type uses a 12 V battery, 330 uF, 16 V capacitor,
trigger switch, and tiny pulse transformer (less than 0.5" x 0.5" x 0.4").
There are about 12 turns on the primary and several thousand turns on the
secondary producing an output of more than 5 kV.  The circuit is basically
similar to that shown in the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns7">Pulse
Starting Circuit Using Small Flyback Transformer</A>.
<p>
The trigger portion of an electronic photoflash or strobe (not the main energy
storage/discharge components and xenon tube) may also be used to start HeNe
tubes.  These run on either batteries or the AC line (sound familiar?) and
produce HV pulses of between 4 to 10 kV.  You may already have a dead pocket
or disposable camera laying around (or your expensive, neglected Nikon) which
has such a module.  See the document:
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/strbfaq.htm">Notes on the
Troubleshooting and Repair of Electronic Flash Units and Strobe Lights</A> for
detailed sample circuits as well as schematics from some common pocket and
disposable cameras and separate flash units.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns9">HeNe Starter Using Electronic Air Cleaner HV
 Module</A></h3>

Electronic air cleaners include a high voltage low current power supply and
oppositely charged grids in the air flow.  A typical unit might produce 7.5 to
10 kV at a few uA - perfect for a HeNe starter!
<p>
Here is a circuit which I assume is for an electronic air cleaner or something
similar.  I received this thing in the mail (no markings).  I did check to make
sure it wasn't a bomb before applying power. :-)  A photo is
shown in: <A HREF="http://www.eio.com/hvgener.gif">Air Cleaner HV Module</A>.
This one is nice because all parts are accessible so modifications
are easy to make.  Or, just strip the HV diodes and caps from a couple of
these modules and build your own voltage multiplier type starter.  Complete
air cleaners may use a potted circuit that looks like a mini-HeNe power supply
brick but isn't.  These can still be used for HeNe laser starters but your
options are more limited.
<p>
The AC line powered driver and HV multiplier are shown in the two diagrams,

The AC input is rectified by D1 and as it builds up past the threshold of the
sidac (D2, 100 V), SCR1 is triggered dumping a small energy storage capacitor
(C1) through the primary of the HV transformer, T1.  This generates a HV pulse
in the secondary.  In about .5 ms, the current drops low enough such that the
SCR turns off.  As long as the instantaneous input voltage remains above about
100 V, this sequence of events repeats producing a burst of 5 or 6 discharges
per cycle of the 60 Hz AC input separated by approximately 13 ms of dead time.
<p>
The LED (IL1) is a power-on indicator. :-)
<p>
The transformer was totally potted so I could not easily determine anything
about its construction other than its winding resistances and turns ratio of
about 1:100.

</PRE>
The secondary side consists of a voltage tripler for the negative output (Y)
and a simple rectifier for the positive output (HV+).  I assume this asymmetry
is due to the unidirectional drive to the transformer primary.
<p>
From my measurements, this circuit produces a total of around 10 kV between
HV+ and Y, at up to 5 uA.  The two output voltages are roughly equal plus and
minus when referenced to point B.
<p>
The only modification required for our needs is to remove R4 to isolate the
HV secondary from the AC line and earth ground.  Once this is done, it may
be necessary to add insulation and/or reroute some of the wiring on the PCB
to prevent arcing as the HV attempts to find its way to ground via the AC
since the negative of the main HV power supply (i.e., Tube-) should be
grounded.
<p>
Then, connect the high voltage outputs up like that of the other inverter
based starters using a HV bypass diode (at least 10 kV) to isolate the HeNe
tube anode circuit from the main power supply.  A 1 nF, 10 kV capacitor
across the diode may be needed to reliably start tubes on short cables
(which don't have much capacitance).  Using a pushbutton switch to activate
the circuit is probably easiest though leaving it on all the time will
probably do no harm since its output current is so small.  For the purist,
an opto-triac or similar device can be added to disable the pulse discharge
circuit once current flows in the HeNe laser tube.
<p>
Where there is no access to R4 (e.g., the unit is totally potted), it probably
won't be possible to obtain the full output voltage from the positive or
negative leads to ground (only between them).  This is because tying one of
the outputs to ground (as would be required if the cathode of the HeNe tube
is earth-grounded as it should be unless totally enclosed and insulated) will
partially short the internal voltage multiplier via R4 to the AC line (the
Neutral wire is grounded at the service panel).  In this case, leave the
negative output of the air cleaner module floating.  This may still result in
enough starting voltage for smaller HeNe tubes (up to perhaps 2 mW).  Don't
even think about attempting to isolate the HeNe tube or starter from ground
unless as noted, it is totally enclosed!
<p>
A quick check to see if one of these modules has enough output voltage to
start your HeNe tube is to connect it up as follows:

<p>
The HeNe tube will glow faintly (actually pulsing at the AC line frequency) if
there is enough voltage to start.  Assuming the tube is good, there may even
be an indication of lasing, but with very low (and possibly erratic) power -
maybe as much as 1 microWatt. :)  So, one of these modules can be used to
perform a quick check of a HeNe tube as well.
<p>
Alternatively, with a bit more rewiring, the multiplier can be used in-line
with the HeNe laser operating voltage supply.  Or, the high voltage diodes
and capacitors (probably from a pair of these units) could be removed and used
for a parasitic multiplier driven from the AC line or inverter based power
supply.
<p>
I tested this starting approach with the inverter, doubler, and filter
capacitor portion of SG-HI3 (with no starting multiplier, see the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg6">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser Power Supply 3
(SG-HI3)</A>.)  It worked quite well starting instantly every time.  The
electrostatic air cleaner unit used for this experiment, while similar to
the one described above, was totally potted and therefore I had to leave
its negative lead floating.  But it was still more than adequate to start
a 1.5 mW HeNe laser tube.
<p>
I intend to use one of these modules in conjunction with a partially broken
Aerotech brick power supply for HeNe lasers in the 5 mW class - model
LSS5(L)6.5, 2,500 +/-300 V at 6.5 mA.  This particular unit has lost its
ability to generate sufficient starting voltage, peaking at only 4 kV (it
should be greater than 10 kV), cause unknown.  However, it runs just fine.
The external starter will enable an otherwise useless brick to be salvaged
for about 99 cents plus the cost of a HV diode, HV cap, and pushbutton switch
(or opto-triac if I feel more ambitious, or maybe have both manual and
automatic start, switch selectable).  I have already tested the setup but still
need to mount everything in a nice box.  The biggest problem was rerouting
one of the traces on the air cleaner PCB to prevent arcing once it was
isolated with its outputs floating on the HV+ side of the Aerotech brick. :)

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns10">Inverter Based Starters</A></h3>

An alternative to the pushbutton switch (above, or the SCR circuits in the
previous designs) is to construct a high voltage inverter using a flyback
transformer that is only active when starting. 
<p>
The HV output is then placed in series with the HV+ of the main supply as
above (Y to HV+) through high value isolation resistors (10M or greater
rated for at least 15 kV).  These are required for safety and protection: so
that the output of the main supply cannot appear on the inverter with any
significant current and so that the inverter is not overloaded (partially
short circuited) by the tube once it starts.  In addition, the resistors
prevent any significant ripple on the inverter output from turning the HeNe
tube *off* once it starts.  While it takes 1000s of volts to start a HeNe
tube, it only takes a few volts to shut it off!
<p>
A high voltage blocking diode (e.g., one or more 15 kV PRV microwave oven HV
rectifiers) bypasses operating current around the inverter once the tube
starts.  A stack of 1 kV diodes (as many as needed for the maximum starting
voltage) can also be used.  General purpose (non-fast recovery) types like
1N4007s are fine.  Make sure they are well insulated - inside a thick plastic
tube, for example.  Since 1N4007s are only a few cents each in modest quantity
(not from Radio Shack!), this may be much cheaper.  It IS more flexible as
a rectifier of nearly any desired voltage rating can be custom made.  I have
replaced a fried (from overvoltage) microwave oven rectifier (in a HeNe laser
power supply, NOT a microwave oven!) with a stack of 20 1N4007s to create a
(hopefully) more robust 20 kV unit.  However, it would probably be better
to derate them by 25 to 50 percent to be sure of the minimum PRV rating.
<p>
The 1nF capacitor may only be needed when driving HeNe laser tubes or heads
attached by short cables or open wiring.  Normally, the capacitance of the
cable to a laser head will provide enough energy storage to keep the discharge
going once it strikes.  But where this is inadequate, starting may be erratic.
If the output of the power supply always goes though a few feet of coax, it
probably isn't needed.

<p>
As shown above, the inverter is configured to add its output to the operating
voltage of the main supply.  For this scheme to work, the negative terminal of
the source must float at the voltage at 'Y'.  This may be possible when using
a flyback transformer with your own windings.  However, it is almost never
possible when using existing circuitry.  In that case, the negative can be
tied to ground (R1 is omitted) but then the benefit of having the sum of the
operating and starting voltages is not available.  The added voltage may not
matter unless the HeNe tube needs all the help it can get!
<p>
To make these fully automatic - to disable the starter once the HeNe tube
fires - a very simple circuit needs to be added to the inverter controller.
For example, where drive is provided by a 555 timer chip in astable mode,
the following circuit will work:

</PRE>
<p>
Once the HeNe tube starts, current of more than about 3 mA through R3 switches
the transistor ON which disables the inverter drive by forcing the 555 to the
reset state.  C1 prevents the inverter from being cutoff if the tube pulses
momentarily but doesn't stay on.
<p>
For examples of inverter based starters in actual HeNe laser power supplies,
see the sections: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg2">Sam's Mid-Size Line Powered
HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL2)</A>, and <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg3">Sam's
Ultrabeam(tm) Line Powered HeNe Laser Power Supply (SG-HL3)</A>.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns11">Inverter Based Starter Examples</A></h3>

Most of the following approaches really only make sense when dealing with
larger (i.e., over 5 mW) or hard-to-start HeNe tubes.  For your .5 mW barcode
scanner laser, they would be gross overkill - somewhat like using a 100 A
power supply for a single LED!
<p>
Since it is relatively straightforward to generate voltages up to 15 kV using
small readily available flyback transformers (even more using those from color
TVs or monitors), and this gets ADDED to the operating voltage, such an
approach is quite effective for large and hard-to-start HeNe tubes.  In
addition, because the inverter does not depend on high voltage AC or DC from
the main supply, it is also easier and safer to construct and troubleshoot,
and this also provides added design flexibility.
<p>
Here are some possibilities:
<ul>
<li>See the various circuits in
 <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/samschem.htm">Various Schematics
 and Diagrams</A>.  In particular:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The "Simple High Voltage Generator" will start a typical small HeNe tube
    using only 4 or 5 VDC for its power input.
<p>
  <li>The "Adjustable High Voltage Power Supply" used as the main supply in the
    section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsg5">Sam's Inverter Driven HeNe Laser
    Power Supply 2 (SG-HI2)</A> provides a great deal of flexibility and WILL
    start any HeNe tube you are likely to encounter!
</ul>
<p>
<li>Use the horizontal deflection/HV circuitry from a defunct (for other
  reasons) TV, monitor, or computer terminal.  No, you cannot (or at least
  should not) just string HV wires from the back of the family's 35 inch TV to
  the laser. :-)
<p>
<ul>
  <li>How much circuitry you actually need (and what you will have to add)
    depends on design but figure on the mainboard with the deflection drive
    and flyback, and probably the yoke (to keep the system properly tuned
    though this may not be essential).
<p>
  <li>Some capacitance on the HV output may be needed as well (though the ones
    I have tried were happy enough with just the stray capacitance of the
    wiring).  Originally, the CRT envelope provided this capacitance.
<p>
  <li>Power will either be the AC line (WARNING: Very dangerous) or a DC supply
    (typically 12 to 24 VDC).  They will usually operate on somewhat lower
    input voltages with correspondingly reduced output.
<p>
  <li>A 555 timer based oscillator or other horizontal sync source may be needed
    as well if the system doesn't free-run at close to the normal horizontal
    scan rate.  This is probably easier where the guts came from a monitor or
    terminal (since a separate TTL compatible horizontal drive input is likely
    to be available) but it should be possible to fake out a TV as well.
</ul>
<p>
  Although the first of the following options should start any HeNe tube you
  are likely to encounter (assuming it is not blown), it never hurts to be
  prepared:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Small B/W TVs, mono computer monitors, and computer terminals will provide
    about 12 to 15 kV (plus the operating voltage).
<p>
  <li>Large B/W TVs and Color TVs and monitors will provide 15 to 30 kV (plus
    operating voltage).  Even more from projection sets!
<p>
  <li>Some larger high performance color monitors may have a separate self
    contained HV module (not part of the horizontal deflection circuitry).
    These modules are powered by a single DC voltage but may also require
    signals like 'HV Enable' and/or a feedback or reference to operate
    properly.
<p>
    These modules probably cannot be floated on top of the operating voltage
    supply since the HV return is likely connected internally to the common
    and the case.  However, with over 20 kV typically available, running
    single ended really should not be a problem. :-)
<p>
    One particular type (found in a 19 inch workstation monitor) produces 25
    kV (more after some tweaking) at up to 1.1 mA (and a bunch of other
    voltages) from a 26 VDC, 2.5 A power supply.  I have been using one of
    these modules to start larger HeNe tubes.  For this purpose, it runs
    happily at 15 VDC and only draws about 1 A (since output current is
    negligible).  See the document:
    <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/gadget.htm">Salvaging
    Interesting Gadgets, Components, and Subsystems</A> for a detailed
    description of this module as well as other unconventional high voltage
    power supplies (and a lot of other neat stuff).
<p>
    But, what a pity to waste the potential (no pun...) of such a device on
    something as boring as starting a HeNe tube (even if it is BIG)!
</ul>
<p>
  One key advantage of using predesigned circuitry is that you are less likely
  to destroy power transistors and other expensive parts - and I have blown my
  unfair share :-(.
<p>
  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns12">Sam's Super-starter(tm)</A> for a specific example of this
  kludge, um, err, approach. :-)
<p>
  Now, I know what you are thinking about now: "Why not run the HeNe tube from
  one of these HV supplies entirely instead of just using it for starting?".
  The problem is that their design provides high voltage (which we only need
  for starting) but at relative low current - typically a maximum of 1 or 2
  mA.  Unlike the design used in "Sam's Inverter driven HeNe Laser Power
  Supply 2" which allows complete control of both the frequency and pulse
  width of the drive, without serious circuit modifications, your options are
  likely to be quite limited.  Available current will probably be marginal at
  best even for small HeNe tubes (3 or 4 mA at the operating voltage) and you
  may blow out components in the attempt.
<p>
<li>The high voltage power supplies from plasma globes, electrostatic dust
  precipitators, bug zappers, electric fences, cattle (or other) prods,
  photocopiers, and laser printers, as well as the ignition system from your
  Craftsman lawn mower or '62 (or later model) Ford, may be pressed into
  service as HeNe tube starters.  Details are left to the highly motivated
  student. :-)
</ul>
<h3><A NAME="hpdhns12">Sam's Super-Starter(tm)</A></h3>

This would be called a kludge by some, a Rube Goldberg by others.  But, hey,
as still others would say: "If it works, use it!".
<p>
The entire horizontal deflection and high voltage sections of a long obsolete
and lonely ASCII video display terminal were pressed into service for starting
larger HeNe tubes.  A source of about 12 VDC at 1.5 A is needed for power and
a 555 timer based oscillator is needed to provide the fake horizontal sync:
<ul>
<li>The deflection circuitry was all on one corner of relatively small board
  (about 3 x 6 inches).  The flyback transformer is a plug-in unit.  I left
  the other circuitry (vertical, video) in place since it is not powered by
  the same supply and therefore is pretty inert.  However, if you want to
  recycle the parts.....
<p>
<li>The horizontal deflection yoke is needed to 'tune' the system - performance
  is much better with it installed.  This wart looks a bit strange but is the
  easiest way to avoid modifying the design.
<p>
<li>Horizontal drive is provided by a 555 timer in astable mode running at about
  16 kHz (the original horizontal deflection rate of the terminal).  A 10K ohm
  pot allows me to fine tune this for maximum HV output.
<p>
  Well, it turns out there was an unused spot on the board ready made for this
  circuit (well almost, at least there was a pattern for a spare 8 pin DIP!
  So, once the thing was basically working, I built the oscillator onto the
  board to reduce the clutter!
<p>
<li>Power requirements are modest - 10 to 15 VDC at just over 1 A.  Over this
  range, the output varies between about 10 and 15 kV (what a coincidence!).
  Input down to about 5 VDC produces correspondingly reduced output but the
  circuit is not particularly stable over this lower range of voltages.)
<p>
<li>In order to float the starting voltage return, one trace on the flyback
  circuit board needs to be cut.  The flyback includes an internal HV
  rectifier.  Connections are made to the main HeNe laser power supply via 10M,
  1 W high voltage isolating resistors.
  
<li>Starting can easily be made automatic by using a 200 ohm current sense
  resistor in the HeNe tube cathode circuit to turn on a transistor (e.g.,
  2N3904) which forces the 555 to the reset state.
</ul>
I guarantee that "Sam's super-starter(tm)" - or its big brother, "Sam's
hyper-starter(tm)" using parts from a color TV or monitor - will start ANY
HeNe tube that can possibly be started!  These also make nice self contained
HV sources for other experiments. :-)
<p>
CAUTION: Since these power supplies were designed for a specific purpose under
specific operating conditions, their behavior when confronted with overloads
or short circuits on the output will depend on their design.  It may not be
pretty - as in they may blow up!  Take care to avoid such events and/or add
suitable protection in the form of fast acting fuses and current limiting to
the switching transistor.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns13">Piezo Impulse Starting Circuits</A></h3>

These circuits use a manual pushbutton but are about as simple as you can get.
<p>
They are based on the spark generating assembly from a disposable butane
lighter that uses a piezo element to generate the spark (as opposed to old
fashioned flint and wheel) or the starter assembly from a gas grill.  These
devices are based on the piezo-electric effect which results when certain
materials are twisted or otherwise deformed.  Even these dirt-cheap lighter
or gas grill starters are able to produce more than 10,000 V mechanically with
the press of a button.
<p>
A simple charge pump using a pair of high voltage diodes completes the
starting circuit.  These are needed because a single press of the button may
not generate enough charge to achieve the required starting voltage.  This is
true at least of the type from disposable lighters.  Perhaps, one from a gas
would work by itself.  The charge pump enables the charge generated by each
button press to be accumulated on the stray capacitance of the wiring, CR2,
PE1, and the HeNe tube anode.  The diodes should have a PRV rating greater
than the starting voltage requirement of your HeNe tube, 15,000 V should be
sufficient.  These type of diodes are typically used in B/W TVs or monochrome
computer monitors.  Microwave oven high voltage rectifiers also work but not
nearly as well (many more presses of the button are needed) due probably to
their higher capacitance and leakage.
<p>
Both of the circuits below work but the second one may have an edge since the
capacitance being charged is slightly smaller since it doesn't include PE1
and its wiring:

</PRE>
Complicated, huh?
<p>
CAUTION: Since the piezo assembly/push button is connected to the positive
terminal of the high voltage power supply, make sure it is well insulated or
the only thing being triggered may not be the HeNe tube!
<p>
Make sure the wiring is short and well insulated - these high voltage pulses
tend to go wherever they want unless properly trained. :-)
<p>
I tested this with the piezo assembly removed from a Scripto lighter found
in the park.  (You will have to agree that this is classic McGyver!)  The
required part is self contained and pops off with minimal disassembly (just
remove the sheet metal flame guard).  With this particular device, the pointy
electrode is negative.  I do not know if this is always the case.  If the
HeNe tube does not start after a reasonable number of button presses, try
interchanging the connections to the piezo assembly.
<p>
Replacement push button starters for gas grills can be purchased at most home
centers and may even work better because they are likely to produce a higher
voltage higher energy spark.  I will not be responsible if your dad cannot
barbecue the dogs and burgers because you 'borrowed' the starter. :-)
<p>
Long-reach butane "multipurpose lighters" are also readily available almost
everywhere.  I paid 77 cents for one on a special.  As with the Scripto, the
piezo mechanism is a self contained module but keeping the entire lighter
intact is most convenient since it includes a large trigger button and nicely
insulated high voltage wires.  The butane tank can't easily be removed since
part of it is the support structure for the piezo module and trigger, but it
could be drained via the fill valve thing at the bottom <b>outdoors and away
from open flames</b> if you can't wait through the required number of
cookouts.  In any case, I'm sure you'll find a way to use up the butane so
that only the much more useful spark remains! ;-)
<p>
As with transformer based pulse starting circuits, these are more effective if
the wire length (and thus the capacitance) between the first high voltage
rectifier (CR1) and the HeNe tube anode is minimized.
<p>
For my bare 1 mW HeNe tube, two presses of the button were required.  For a
laser head with a 3 foot long high voltage cable, 4 or 5 presses were needed
but it always started eventually.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhns14">RF or Microwave Starters</A></h3>

The following isn't really a serious suggestion - at least not as part of a
little HeNe laser.  However, it could possibly be a way of getting a really
hard-to-start tube to start for testing at least: Since anything at all that
gets the gas ionized in the bore should work as a starter, it may be possible
to use a source of RF (e.g., from that long forgotten Ham rig) for this
purpose.  A small Tesla coil might also be suitable its voltage isn't high
enough to puncture the glass. :(  How to couple the RF energy to the tube is
left as an exercise for the student - it could be via a wire wrapped around
the tube, placing the tube near the output coil or antenna, or by attaching
the anode directly via a small high voltage capacitor.
<p>
However, my initial attempt at using one of those hand-held BD-10
"Oudin" coils intended for vacuum leak testing (among other things)
totally failed.  (These may also be called Tesla coils or spark
coils.)  When used at various locations on the glass envelope of a
good tube with my adjustable HeNe laser power supply running just
below the normal operating voltage so the tube was flashing, there was
absolutely positively no effect of any kind except to cause a glow in
the gas reservoir.  The rate of flashing didn't change.  When I used
it on my impossible-to-start tube, there was similarly no effect, even
when applied directly to the tube anode.  In this case, the tube
seemed to light down the bore but wouldn't catch.  But maybe that
wasn't a fair test: While my impossible-to-start tube had been known
to run normally - if it could be started - the laser time I tried it was
several years ago and who knows how hard to start it is now!  (The gas
is good though as it would flash with lasing if run with reverse polarity.)
So, perhaps I'll try again with a tube I know can indeed run if started.
<p>
And, here's another one to be taken even less seriously:  Cut a pair of holes
in the front and back of the a microwave oven just large enough for some of
those longer HeNe tubes to fit!  Starting cycle: 3 seconds on HIGH (with a cup
of water to act as a load)!  Yes, I know, it would look kind of silly to have
your HeNe laser tube sticking out of the family microwave!  I did say I wasn't
really serious, didn't I? :)  WARNING: Please don't attempt this stunt - both
dangerous levels of microwave leakage and HeNe tube frying arcs are quite
possible!
<p>
OK, I think that's enough on HeNe laser starters! ;-)

<h2>Current Regulators</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hpdcre0">Regulation Requirements for HeNe Laser Power Supplies</A></h3>

Since for optimal performance, the HeNe tube expects a specific operating
current, a regulator is desirable but not essential.  Current is not nearly
as critical with HeNe lasers as with laser diodes.  A few percent on either
side of the recommended value won't matter.
<p>
Supply voltage fluctuations do affect operating current proportionately more
than would be expected since the voltage drop across the tube is fairly
constant.  Therefore, nearly the entire change appears across the ballast
resistor.  The smaller the ballast resistor, the larger the current change
for a given voltage change.  This may mean that a 2 percent change in line
voltage produces a 10 percent change in tube current - still not a big deal
for most applications.  For experimental use, it is perfectly acceptable to use
ower supply without regulation and a Variac to control the input as a way
of adjusting output current.  The setup I routinely use for testing HeNe laser
tubes is a combination of a Variac, an unregulated HeNe laser power supply, and
a ballast resistor selector and meter box.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrmb">Ballast Resistor Selector and Meter Box</A>.
Some commercial HeNe lasers have even used a power rheostat in series with
the input of the main HV transformer for this purpose!
<p>
However, where stability is required (both short term and long term due to
component and tube aging) or where it is desired to be able to switch tubes
without monitoring tube current and adjusting the input voltage, a regulator
is essential.  This also provides an easy way of adding a current adjustment
control to accomodate a variety of HeNe tubes.
<ul>
<li>It must be able to adjust the operating voltage over a sufficient range
  (200 V to 2 kV or more depending HeNe tube and ballast resistor) to maintain
  tube current constant independent of line voltage variations and drift in
  components due to heating (both the ballast resistor and HeNe tube change
  characteristics slightly as they heat up) and age.  With an adequate
  compliance range, the supply will be able to drive a variety of laser heads
  or HeNe tubes whose characteristics are not identical.
<p>
  The regulator must be designed with protection so that it (and the power
  supply) are not damaged during starting or should the laser head or HeNe
  tube not be connected (where there is no current but very high voltage) or
  as a result of fault conditions like accidental short circuits.
<p>
<li>For AC line operated power supplies, linear post regulators are often
  used.  These can be in the high-side (anode circuit) or low-side (cathode
  circuit).  Both types have been used in commercial products.  However, I see
  little reason to consider a high-side regulator since it must also be
  insulated for the 8 kV or greater starting voltage.
<p>
  The circuits are fairly simple.  However, more than one high voltage
  transistor in a series cascade may be needed to achieve the desired
  compliance range.  If only there were such a thing as an LM317 (set up in
  constant current mode) that accepted a 3 kV DC input!  NPN transistors with
  adequate voltage ratings (300 to 500 V) are somewhat more common than PNP
  types especially for higher power types.  MOSFETs with suitable ratings are
  also available and relatively low cost.  Manufacturers of HV devices include
  <A HREF="http://www.supertex.com/">Supertex</A> and
  <A HREF="http://www.zetex.com/">Zetex</A>.  There are many more.
  Universal semiconductor replacement manufacturers like
  <A HREF="http://www.nteinc.com/">NTE Electronics</A> and others
  have a few devices that are suitable but the quality and consistency of
  original name brand parts may be better, more complete specifications are
  available, and they are often cheaper as well.  (Note: As of January 2001,
  NTE has purchased the assets of ECG so the ECG parts listed below may no
  longer be available, use the NTE or SK equivalent which usually has the
  same number with the 'NTE' or 'SK' prefix.)
<p>
  Some typical part numbers are listed below.  Those rated a watt or less are

</ul>
<p>
(There are also many high power MOSFETs with Vdss ratings of 500 V or more.)
<p>
  Although all the linear regulator designs in subsequent sections of this
  chapter and in the chapter: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hsctoc">Complete HeNe
  Laser Power Supply Schematics</A> use bipolar transistors, you can substitute
  one or more high voltage MOSFETs (depending on the specific compliance range
  required) but need to take care that you NEVER violate the maximum ratings,
  particularly maximum Vgs, which is usually quite low (e.g., +/- 20 V).  This
  means protecting against voltage spikes during power on/off and starting, as
  well as being fault tolerant of even momentary shorts on the output.
  However, high voltage MOSFETs do not suffer from the second breakdown
  failure mode of bipolar transistors.  Since MOSFETs have essentially zero
  gate current, the drive circuitry is less of a problem (the voltage divider
  resistors can be very large).  However, the Vgs threshold voltage is not as
  tightly specified (and generally higher) compared to the Vbe drop for a
  bipolar transistor which will affect the design as well.  In the past,
  MOSFETs with similar voltage ratings to HV bipolar were more expensive but
  this appears no longer to be the case.  I don't know if that is the reason
  I have never seen a linear MOSFET based regulator in a HeNe laser power
  supply.
<p>
  For all but the smallest HeNe tubes, the larger (>1 W) transistors will be
  required to handle the power.  In principle, TV or monitor horizontal output
  transistors (up to 1000 V or more, high power) could be used to reduce the
  number of required devices in a cascade but they tend to have very low
  gain (less than 10) making drive more difficult.  High voltage high power
  MOSFETs could also be used in this manner but both these approaches are
  probably more expensive than using a larger number of lower voltage
  transistors.
<p>
  For other gas lasers like the carbon dioxide or helium-cadmium type requiring
  tube currents of up to 100 mA or more, the use of high power bipolar
  transistors or MOSFETs may be required if a linear regulator is to be used.
  Its basic circuit topology will be similar or identical to that used for the
  low current HeNe laser power supply but much greater attention will have to
  be paid to heat dissipation at these higher currents!
<p>
  The compliance range for a commercial power supply with a linear regulator
  is typically between about .75 and .95 Vo where Vo is the output voltage
  under load.  For example, a power supply with an output voltage of 2,000 V
  will be able to provide between 1,500 and 1,900 V.  There is no reason why a
  wider range could not be implemented - it is just a matter of cost (more
  transistors) as the maximum allowed voltage drop across the pass transistor
  or transistor cascade determines the lowest output voltage possible before
  protection kicks in (or the regulator blows up!).
<p>
  While I have seen commercial HeNe laser power supplies using these types of
  transistors without heatsinks, I consider this unwise as they can run hot.
  A heatsink represents a very small insurance premium!
<p>
<li>An alternative to a basic linear regulator is use a second transformer
  with its primary in series with the AC line or HV winding of the main power
  transformer, and its secondary attached to a feedback controlled load.  By
  varying this load based on laser tube current, the power supply's output
  voltage can be precisely adjusted to compensate for line and load changes.
<p>
  One advantage of this approach is that the regulator can be designed so that
  the control circuitry all operates at low voltage.  Therefore, no high
  voltage, likely to self destruct, solid state components or cascades are
  needed.  The regulator transformer provides the LV to HV interface via its
  turns-ratio.   Its insulation provides isolation from the high voltage side
  components.  By using thyristors with phase control or some other sort of
  chopper circuit for the load, power dissipation can be cut way down compared
  to a simple linear regulator or linearly controlled load.  Overcurrent and
  short circuit protection are easily added minimizing the chances of permanent
  damage from most fault conditions.
<p>
  Certain versions of the SP-261 exciter for the Spectra-Physics 125A
  large-frame helium-neon laser use this approach.  A current sense voltage
  is fed to a unijunction transistor/SCR phase control circuit which acts as
  a variable load on the low voltage side of a transformer whose high voltage
  winding is in series with the high voltage secondary of the transformer
  driving the main doubler/filter circuit.
<p>
<li>For inverter type power supplies, there is also the option of controlling
  the switching frequency or pulse width via a feedback circuit from secondary
  to primary - a true regulated switching power supply.
<p>
  In addition to constant current regulation, high and low limits and fault
  protection can be implemented by sensing input current and load current and
  voltage.
<p>
  With a wide compliance design, the starting voltage is within the range of
  the power supply output voltage and there is no separate starter.  Other
  designs provide a more limited compliance range and use a separate starter.
  Still others use a combination of these - a moderate compliance inverter
  and modest boost multiplier.
<p>
  These are the approaches use in most modern commercial HeNe and other laser
  power supplies.

CAUTION: If your tube is mounted with its cathode connected to a metal case,
earth ground must be tied to Tube- for safety as Tube- may be at a potential
of several hundred volts with respect to HV-.
<p>
The compliance range is about 300 V so a ballast resistor still needs to be
selected to enable the regulation to be effective.  Use the procedure described
in the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf0">Selecting the Ballast Resistor</A> to determine
an appropriate ballast resistor value for the desired tube current and a power
supply voltage 150 V less than that of your (unregulated) supply.  This
circuit should then maintain that current constant and permit some adjustment
(or modulation if desired) of the current on either side of the set-point.
<p>
For greater compliance, a cascade of high voltage transistors can be used as
outlined in the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdcre2">High Compliance Cascade
Regulator</A>.  This shows a low-side approach.  Also see the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscsp2">Spectra-Physics Model 247 HeNe Laser Power Supply
(SP-247)</A> which is a high-side version of a similar circuit.

<h3><A NAME="hpdcre2">High Compliance Cascade Regulator</A></h3>

The circuit below is suitable for providing current regulation for high power
HeNe laser power supplies.  As drawn it should be capable of about 1,000 to
1,200 V compliance at up to 10 mA.  Additional high voltage NPN transistors
and base resistors may be added to extend its range still further.

The PNP transistor (Q5) buffers the reference voltage so that the very low
current source (point Z through Rx tapped off of the main filter capacitor
string) can drive the base of the cascade.  The way to understand its
operation is to realize that Q5 implements an emitter follower with respect to
the tap on R6.  Without it, the cascade would be driven directly from the 15 V
reference point; Q5 drags down Q5's base to the value (+0.7 V) set by R6.  I
think, I hope. :)  If the reference can supply a couple of a few mA (say, from
a 50 V source through 10K (Rx), R6 can be reduced in value and the circuit
could be simplified as shown below:

<p>
The base resistors, R1 through R4 (more or less) equally distribute the
voltage between G and HV-.  The respective transistors act as emitter
followers and maintain approximately the same voltages across their C-E
terminals.  Within the compliance range, the voltage across R7+R8 will be
equal to the voltage on the wiper of R6 (give or take a diode drop depending
on whether Q5 is present).
<p>
CAUTION: Make sure that the open circuit voltage of your power supply minus
the laser tube and ballast resistor voltages cannot exceed the total breakdown
voltage of the transistor cascade (4 * Vceo in this case as bad things may
happen)!  As drawn, it is certainly suitable for a 2,200 V power supply with
almost any tube.  However, if you are using this with a 3,000 V supply and
a .5 mW tube requiring 1,100 V at 3 mA, the compliance range will be exceeded
and the transistors may blow - pop-pop-pop-pop!  Then, you get maximum current
through the ballast resistor and laser tube which will make them extremely
unhappy :-(.  A bag of 200 V zeners in series could be used to limit the
voltage across the transistor cascade.  Or, see the section:
<A HREF=laserhsc.htm#hscsp3">Spectra-Physics Model 255 Exciter (SP-255)</A>
for an example of a simple overvoltage protection circuit.
<p>
R7 sets the overall current range.  R6 adjusts the current from a minimum
determined by the maximum voltage across R1 through R4 to the limit set by R7.
However, regulation should be better when R6 is set near its maximum since
small changes in voltage/current will have correspondingly less effect than if
you are trying to regulate with just a few mV difference to play with!  The
adjustable R6 can be omitted entirely if desired (tap off the top of CR1) and
R7 used as the current adjust.  The only thing undesirable about this is that
this control is somewhat non-linear so that the high current portion is all
squashed at one end.
<p>
Rs is a current sense resistor.  Monitoring across it with a volt meter is
a convenient way of setting tube current.  Sensitivity is 1 V/mA.  A current
meter can also be put across it and will read tube current directly.  The LED
provides a 'Beam On' indication and rough measure of tube current as well.

<h3><A NAME="hpdilrc">Increasing Linear Regulator Current</A></h3>

While the regulators described above will be perfectly happy with the current
required by most internal mirror HeNe tubes (3.3 to 8 mA), there are larger
(or different types of) lasers and unusual configurations where more current
is needed.
<p>
The basic linear cascade regulator should be capable of higher current as long
as the transistors are mounted on adequate heatsinks can care is taken to
ensure they don't operate anywhere near the limits of their Safe Operating
Area (SOA).
<p>
Devices like the MJE3439T are often used without any heatsinks in commercial
designs so adding one will go a long way to preserving their lives.  What
may need to be done in addition is to reduce the value of the base resistors
so that there is adequate drive based on the transistor's Hfe specifications.
To be safe, increasing the number of stages in the cascade to compensate for
the additional current and keep the power dissipation of each transistor may
be prudent.
<p>
For dual (or multiple) tube applications or dual discharge lasers like the
Spectra-Physics model 125 (SP-125), a pair of regulators could also be used.
(Note that separate ballast resistors will be required for these.)  For the
SP-125 in particular, a common cathode at the center of the tube is fed from
separate anodes at each end.  Where a power supply is to be built (or the
original one repaired or rebuilt), the total discharge current of 35 mA can
easily be split into two currents of 17.5 mA each - easily handled with very
minor modifications to the basic design in the section:
<A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdcre2">High Compliance Cascade Regulator</A>.
See the section: <A HREF="laserhcl.htm#hclsp12x">Spectra-Physics 120, 124, and
125, HeNe Laser Specifications</A> if you are curious about the SP-125.
<p>
Another alternative is to parallel multiple cascades and just combine their
outputs.  However, with proper heatsinking, this shouldn't be necessary for
HeNe lasers.  But carbon dioxide, helium-cadmium, or other lasers requiring
greater discharge current, this and/or the use of higher power transistors
may be required.  Or better yet, the use of a more efficient high frequency
inverter instead!

<h3><A NAME="hpdcre3">Simple Shunt Regulator</A></h3>

For some types of power supplies, a shunt regulator can be added to the output
prior to the starter.  This, in effect, acts like a huge high power zener diode
across which bypasses enough current through it to keep the voltage below a
selected value.
<p>
A simple approach like this works quite well for supplies using high-droop
transformers (e.g., oil burner ignition or luminous tube/neon sign types).
The no load voltage on these can easily exceed 1.5 times the operating voltage
and the excess energy in the filter capacitors would normally be dumped into
the HeNe tube when it starts - which is hard on the tube!
<p>
A shunt regulator consisting of a stack of zener diodes (or gas tubes, remember
those?) prior to the bypass HV diode could be added to reduce this difference
by providing a substitute current path - loading down the transformer - until
the HeNe tube starts.
<p>
In this case, since the regulator is only passing significant current before
the tube starts, with careful design, the zeners or whatever don't need to
dissipate high power for too long.  That is, unless the tube fails to start or
becomes disconnected!
<p>
For high droop transformers, a dropping resistor is probably not needed at all.
However, for normal power transformers, a dropping resistor (Rd in the diagram
below) should be used to prevent the transformer from being overloaded (as well
as the regulator being smoked.  These are able to source much greater than
their rated current (at least for a short time) with little reduction in output
voltage.

</PRE>
When contemplating using this sort of approach for regulation of the operating
voltage itself, both the continuous power dissipation of the regulator
components AND power supply transformer (or inverter) must be taken into
consideration.
<ul>
<li>For this to work without meltdown, the number of zeners would have to be
 matched to the voltage setting - else a new stack of zeners might be required
 in short order. :-(  A power transistor or transistors on a good heat sink
 can be added to the basic circuit to handle the power if needed.
<p>
<li>Oil burner ignition and neon sign transformers, since they are internally
 current limited, don't mid having an load pulling down their output (though
 for some types, running into a short circuit all day will release the magic
 black goop!).  However, normal transformers may become mighty unhappy very
 quickly with a shunt regulator dragging down their output voltage (and the
 regulator may release its magic smoke since much more current may be
 available than what is listed in the transformer's specs).  As noted above,
 provide a series dropping resistor for the purpose!
</ul>
For example, to regulate at 2 kV with a maximum current of 8 mA using a power
supply with a no-load output at Y of 3 kV, you can use 20, 100 V 1 W zeners.
Rd should be about 120 K, 10 W.
<p>
We won't even talk about the efficiency of the power supply when running
continuously with a shunt regulator but you wouldn't be playing with
HeNe lasers at all if overall electrical->optical output efficiency were a
prime consideration!
<p>

400 mW zener diodes and was trying to figure out a good use for them!
<p>
(From: Kim Clay (bkc@maco.net).)
<P>
I did try the zener diode shunt regulator a few different times and it worked
quite well. I just have to set it up for each tube that I'm using AND those
little zeners can put out lots of heat when there are so many in a small area!
have a small muffin fan in the 5 kV supply & I made sure there was airflow over
them.

<h3><A NAME="hpderip">External Regulator for Inverter Power Suppl\y</A></h3>

This might also be called "Kludge #65243" to modify a fixed current
brick for variable current operation. :)
<p>
Where the internal current regulator of an inverter-type HeNe laser power
supply has failed so that there is no longer any way of controlling laser
tube current except via the DC input voltage, it's possible to add an
external regulator to do just that.
<p>
Some HeNe laser power supply bricks tend to fail in this manner, expecially
if hooked up incorrectly.
<p>
So, step 1 of the procedure to use the external DC regulator technique
would be to hook up a suitable model backwards. :)  One that is very
reliable in this regard - that is, it fails reliably and in the same way
every time - is the Laser Drive 103-23, normally rated for 21 to 31 VDC input
with a fixed output current of 3.5 mA, suitable for many 1 mW-class HeNe laser
tubes.  However, when "modified" in this manner, it can provide 7 mA or more.
There will still be a maximum continuous power rating, which for the 103 is
around 7 W.  So, that's still a limiting factor, but now the full range of
the power supply will be available.
<p>
The very simple circuit is shown in
<A HREF="hpselr1.gif">HeNe Laser PSU External Linear Regulator 1</A>.
The return for the HeNe laser tube current goes though
a resistance, variable from 1.5K to 3.5K ohms to ground.  This provides a
voltage proportional to tube current across it.  The non-grounded
side feeds the cathode of an 8.2 V zener whose anode goes to the
base of a 2N3904 transistor.  Its emitter is grounded and its collector
goes to the Adj input of an LT1084 low dropout regulator, wired for a maximum
voltage of about 10 VDC (200 ohms and 1.5K ohms for the two resistors).
(A common LM317 would also work, but would require a volt or so more
headroom.)  So, when the voltage across the variable resistance exceeds
about 8.9 V, the 2N3904 turns on and limits the output of the DC regulator.
<p>
The filter capacitor on the output of the LT1084 is required for stability
of this particular regulator.  (This large a cap is not needed with an LM317.)
But minimizing the capacitance is desirable to reduce the loop delay. and
there is also generally substantial filtering inside the brick itself anyhow.
The capacitor across the sense resistors assures loop stability.  The
residual noise and ripple at the output of the HeNe laser power supply
should be close to spec'd values. In fact for those supplies with a ripple
reducer as the final filter stage, the residual ripple is nearly undetectable.
<p>
With these component values, the adjustment range is from about 3 to 6 mA.
With a 100K ballast resistance and 1 mW HeNe laser tube, the actual
DC input to the brick is about 12 to 17 VDC.  For the 1 mW tube at 3.5 mA,
about 13 VDC is needed on the input.  For a 2 mW tube at 5 mA, about
15 VDC would be needed.  Of course, running the 103-23 continuously
would also exceed the 7 W rating of the power supply at the higher
tube voltage.
<p>
I also tried 2 other "modified" :) HeNe laser power supply bricks
(all Laser Drive!).  Actually, they both had lost regulation on their
own, cause unknown, but I didn't need to help them along!
The first was a 111-Adj-1 from an HP-5517B laser.  This worked
without modifications to the circuit at about
7 to 9 V for 3 to 6 mA into the 1 mW tube.  A much larger 380T brick, with
an output rating of 3100 V at 5 to 7 mA and an input of 22 to 26 VDC,
operated in a manner very similar to the 103-23 with the 1 mW tube.
I then connected it to a Melles Griot 05-LHR-911 laser head and that
worked fine except that I had to add additional filter capacitance
across the DC to the supply for it to remain stable over the entire
range of input voltage and tube current.  I used a 10,000 uF, 25 V
capacitor, though that was probably overkill.  I then tried a Uniphase
1125P and that worked fine as well.  I haven't yet tried it with a
high power tube, mainly because I didn't have one handly that was
still within the specs of the 380T.  It wouldn't even start an Aerotech
OEM12R or Uniphase 1145P, though these may have been hard-start and
my DC power supply didn't go above 20 V.  But if it works (or if I find
a higher power brick that's lost its regulation), this would
have the potential to be the basis for a universal HeNe laser power
supply that would not only be able to be used at the normal spec'd current
with lasers from less than 0.5 mW to over 20 mW (using a brick like a broken
380T), but also be able to drive lasers having requirements that may fall
through the cracks of major power supply manufacturers.  For example,
try to find a compatible brick for a tube that runs on 4 mA at
2.5 kV as a standard product!  Even for those that are adjustable,
the minimum current may be much too high for supplies able to
provide 2.5 kV.
<p>
The main drawback to schemes like this is that the addition of the linear
regulator adds substantial power dissipation, so one of the main benefits
of using an inverter brick is lost.  So, the DC input voltage to the
regulator should be selected so that it's only enough above the required
DC input voltage to the laser power supply to account for the voltage drop of
the regulator, and enough additional to handle variations in tube
voltage and current.  So, best would be a variable switchmode DC power
supply feeding the external linear regulator.  However, if power dissipation
is a serious issue, an only slightly more complicated switchmode regulator
could be implemented instead.
<p>
But this really does give a second life to otherwise damaged power supplies!
So, while I can't answer the question of whether laser power supplies can
have 9 lives, they can certainly have 2, at least under some conditions!
<p>
Note that it should be possible to use this approach to <i>reduce</i> the
output current of a properly functioning brick, but I haven't tested that!
This would then permit lower current tubes to be run on standard power
supplies.

<h3><A NAME="hpdcre4">Inverter Switchmode Regulator Controller</A></h3>

Inverter based HeNe (and CO2) laser power supplies generally use pulse width
modulation (PWM) to implement the regulation of operating current.  This can
be accomplished with a simple 555 timer but most modern designs use an SMPS
PWM IC like the SG3524 or UC3842.  These are inexpensive, robust, and provide
startup and protection features that may be used if desired.
<p>
The major internal functional blocks of these IC are the Sawtooth Oscillator
(ramp generator) and Voltage Comparator.  Timing components (Rt, Ct) set the
(constant) oscillator frequency.  The Voltage Comparator, subtracts the error
signal (Ve) from the instantaneous value of the sawtooth waveform.  Its output
is high only if Verr is greater than Vosc.  The pulse width is therefore a
linear function of error voltage over a fairly wide range.
<p>
The output may need to be buffered to drive the main switchmode transistor
(bipolar or MOSFET).  Until the HeNe tub starts, some means must be provided
to assure that the duty cycle is limited to prevent damage due to transformer
core saturation and excess current.

The Error Amp may actually be part of the PWM controller IC.  External sense
circuitry may consist of nothing more than a resistor in the HeNe tube return
to provide a voltage proportional to current, and F(s) may consist simply of a
RC network to control loop response.
<p>
Typical oscillator frequency is 200 kHz.  To analyze this circuit precisely
would require digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.  However, where the
loop response is limited to much less than the switching frequency, analog
techniques can be used.  Consult application notes for the PWM controller ICs
for details.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscic1">HeNe Inverter Power Supply Using PWM Controller IC (IC-HI1)</A>
for an example of a design using this approach.

<h3><A NAME="hpdhclp">HeNe Laser Power Supply Current Limit Protection</A></h3>

Having some means of shutting down the HeNe laser power should the tube
wink out repeatedly, short or arc over, or become uncooperative in some other
way, would go a long way to prevent catastrophic failure.  While the
manufacturers of modern HeNe laser power supplies claim protection from
common fault conditions, some are better than others.  And, none likely
address long term fault conditions for an unattended laser.
<p>
It's simple in principle to add under and over-current protection to any
HeNe laser power supply brick.  Setting a low current limit would protect
against a disconnected laser head, or one that decides to sputter or pulse
after it warms up.  Setting a high limit on current would protect against
arcing or a dead short, or a tube with a very low discharge voltage due to
a broken bore.
<p>
There are many ways of implementing the protection circuits but they all
need to compare the tube current against low and high limits and disconnect
input power if either limit is violated.  Different time constants for the
low and high limits allow for an occasional hiccup that would momentary
decrease the average current but would trip on any overcurrent condition.
A reset timer would disable the low limit for a predetermined time to allow
for slow-start tubes.
<p>
The brute force approach uses a pair of voltage comparators monitoring the
voltage drop on a current sense resistor.  The AND of their output drives
a relay that controls input power.  RC networks implement the reset delay
and set the low and high time constants.
<p>
An alternative if you're so inclined is to use a PIC chip with a few lines
of code to do the timing and control, with at most a pair of voltage
comparators if the PIC doesn't have at least 2 analog inputs.  One could
think of all sorts of extensions to this approach if you're so inclined.
<p>
My basic solution is to add a sensitive relay that is initially bypassed
for starting and then remains energized by the laser tube current.  A simple
crowbar circuit shuts the supply down if the current goes too high.  There
is no need to handle under-current explicitly since running a HeNe laser
tube slightly below spec'd current won't hurt anything and is an unlikely
failure mode anyhow.  If the current goes so low that the tube winks out,
then the relay turns the supply off.
<p>
The schematic for what I built into a pair of modified
Spectra-Physics 248 exciters may be found in
<A HREF="hpsprot1.gif">HeNe Laser PSU Protection Circuit 1</A>.
The Opto-22 MP240D2 is a solid state relay which is guaranteed
to turn on with less than 3 mA - low enough for virtually any
HeNe laser tube.  The AC version has "contacts" (actually
a triac) rated at up to 2 A and 240 VAC.  The DC version,
also shown, using an Opto-22 DC60MP handles loads up to 60 V
and 3 A.  (A sensitive electromagnetic relay could also be used if a
suitable one can be found.)  A momentary switch bypasses the contacts when
starting the laser.  The crowbar is a home-built SCR consisting of a 2N3904
and 2N3906 with each base connected to the collector of the other
transistor.  The SCR is across the relay input in series with a pot
to adjust the current trip set-point.  Should the current go too high,
the voltage drop across the relay input and pot will exceed the threshold
of a zener diode triggering the SCR, which bypasses input current to the
relay thus shutting off the power supply.
<p>
I have assembled and tested PCBs for both the AC and DC versions.

<h3><A NAME="hpdrrn">Reducing the Ripple and Noise in a HeNe Laser Power Supply</A></h3>

While a HeNe laser will remain lit and produce a beam with a variation
in tube current of 10 percent or more, for some applications, a true
constant current is required for optimum results.  The reason is that
any variation in tube current also results in a variation in output
power as well a optical frequency.  Critical applications include
those involving measurements based on the output power and heterodyning
of this laser with another similar laser, or with some other optical
reference.  They are usually those not involving a human observer since
the magnitude of any beam intensity variation is not likely to be
noticed by eye, and certainly not the optical frequency! :)
<p>
<ul>
<li>For output power, the maximum variation is generally under 20 percent
 over the entire range for which the discharge remains stable.  This can
 be used to advantage in amplitude modulating a HeNe laser but is
 otherwise generally either irrelevant or undesirable.
<p>
<li>For optical frequency, the maximum variation is only a few MHz out
 of 474 TeraHertz (the optical frequency corresponding to 633 nm) so
there's no way to even detect it unless comparing  with another laser!
</ul>
<p>
Most commercial HeNe laser power supplies have some type of current
regulation, so the actual effects are already well below the worst
case.  Nonetheless, if you're determined to have the cleanest
(optical-wise) laser on the block, the next two sections deal with
add-ons to linear and switchmode HeNe laser power supplies to virtually
eliminate ripple and noise in the laser tube current.

<h4><A NAME="hpdrrnl">Reducing Ripple and Noise in a HeNe Laser Power Supply with a Linear Regulator</A></h4>

When used with a compatible laser head, most commercial AC line powered
HeNe laser power supplies that include a linear regulator already have
very low ripple and noise.  So, it may not be necessary to do anything.
Such supplies are mostly older AC line powered models from companies
like Aerotech, Jodon, Metrologic, Spectra-Physics, and others.  Virtually
all modern HeNe laser power supplies use switchmode technology for both
DC input and AC line supplies.  If you have a linear supply and it has
a regulator (not all do!), then there may no need to do anything.  And,
if there is no regulator, it's probably easier to find another supply
than to add one!
<p>
So the first thing to do with a candidate supply is to check for AC
in the tube current.  This can be done by installing a 1K ohm resistor
in the cathode return and monitoring the voltage across it with an
oscilloscope.  The sensitivity is then 1 mA/V.  For a typical laser
with a nominal 6.5 mA tube current, 65 mV p-p ripple and noise would
be 1 percent which is certainly acceptable for most non-critical
applications.  0.1 percent would be readily achievable if it isn't
already that good.  If it's much worse than 1 percent, the regulator
is probably not working correctly, the tube is not compatible with
the supply, the line voltage is too low or too high (or not set
correctly), or there is no regulator!
<p>
At least, most of these supplies have accessible internal circuitry - they
are not potted like modern supplies.  The exceptions, like some of those from
Coherent and Hughes, will need to be dealt with like switchmode supplies as
discussed in the next section.  Or, find another candidate.
<p>
Assuming there is a regulator and it's working properly but you'd like
a cleaner supply, the two easiest things to do are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>For line frequency or double line frequency ripple, increase the size
 (uF) of the main filter capacitor bank or add a second filter capacitor
 bank with some resistance between them.  Since these supplies are often
 quite old, it's a good idea (or at least a good excuse!) to replace the
 dried out electrolytic capacitors anyhow.  With modern technology,
 capacitors with the same voltage rating and much higher capacitance (uF)
 will probably fit easily.  So, simply using replacements that are 3 to 5
 times higher uF value will provide an equivalent reduction in ripple.
 Just make sure the equalizing resistors have a low enough value to
 work acceptably with the larger uF capacitor.
<p>
 Alternatively (or in addition), adding a second filter capacitor bank
 separated from the first by a resistor to form an RC filter section
 cap provide a dramatic decrease in ripple.  For example, a second
 filter capacitor bank of 2 uF with a 50K ohm resistor in front of it
 will reduce the ripple by more than a factor of 10.  The down side is
 that there will be a voltage drop across the resistor, which will
 reduce compliance range of the supply.  Thus, a supply with the
 worst case spec'd leakage current of a higher voltage maximum tube
 voltage may need to be used.
<p>
 WARNING: Adding capacitance also increases the danger of electrocution
 should an unfortunate part of your anatomy come in contact with its output!
<p>
<li>For excessive pink or white noise, check the components used for the
 reference in the regulator.  It may be possible to replace the garden variety
 zener with a low noise part (e.g., 1N4109 for 15 V).  Or, it may be
 possible to add filtering across it.  CAUTION: With some designs, the
 latter will not work without additional modifications as the reference
 voltage must be stable at the instant the tube starts to assure that
 the transistor pass-bank is turned on.  Else, bad things may happen!
</ul>
<p>
I modified a pair of Spectra-Physics 248 exciters in this way to provide
ultra-low ripple and noise for driving metrology lasers.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscspc1">Converting the SP-248 into a Low Ripple
Protected HeNe Laser Power Supply</A>.

<h4><A NAME="hpdrrns">Reducing Ripple and Noise in a HeNe Laser Power Supply
 with a Switchmode Regulator</A></h4>

Most modern HeNe laser power supplies are switchmode inverters that
either run from low voltage DC or rectified/doubled AC line voltage.
Unless a special low ripple model is specified, these typically have
1 to 3 percent ripple at a typical frequency of 30 or 40 kHz.
However, it's still worth measuring the actual ripple - you may have
gotten lucky with a low ripple model!  Although in principle, monitoring
the voltage across a 1K ohm cathode return resistor, as with the
linear power supply above, should work, this may result in falsely
high values for the ripple current due to stray capacitance and
ground loops - or something!  I was unable to reliably make these
measurements electrically as even attaching the scope ground greatly
increased the apparent ripple, real or imagined!  And, adding or
changing the external filter circuit (below) didn't have the expected
or even a predictable effect.  My first solution was to pass the tube current
through an LED and measure its light output with a back-biased photodiode.
Then, the ratio of AC to DC for the photodiode voltage was a fairly
accurate indication of the amount of ripple with respect to average current.
Later, it was clear that even this approach had problems as the photodiode
was picking up high frequency interference from the brick!  So, ultimately
I used my capacitor isolated high voltage AC scope probe (20K ohms in series
with 1 nF, with an NE2 between the output and ground to limit the peak
voltage across the scope input).
<p>
Where the ripple is found to be excessive (more than 3 or 4 percent) in
a commercial switchmode HeNe laser power supply, it's
likely that the internal ripple reducer has failed and an external
circuit will be needed to restore acceptable performance.  However, as
long as the DC current regulation is still working correctly, this
should be possible.
<p>
Since virtually all of these supplies totally potted, access to anything
inside is not possible.  So, the basic approach is to add an external
circuit consisting of a pi-section filter with two HV capacitors and
a single transistor circuit that provides a high impedance to AC current
but doesn't interfere with the internal DC current regulator.  This is
similar to what is used in some commercial HeNe laser power supplies such as
the <A HREF="mg829sch.gif">Melles Griot 05-LPM-829 HeNe Laser Power Supply</A>.
The "pi" consists of C18, the circuit with Q7, and C17.
<p>
The circuit I built is functionally identical, though some part values differ
slightly.  <A HREF="smhpsrr1.gif">Switchmode HeNe Laser Power
Supply Ripple Reducer 1</A> cuts the ripple from a Laser Drive 103-23 (1,100
to 1,500 V at 3.5 mA) by a factor of at least 50, from about 2 percent p-p
to under 0.04 percent p-p.  It goes directly at the output of the power supply
- before the laser tube ballast resistor or the Alden cable of a laser head.
The very cute completed PCB is shown in
<A HREF="smhpsrr1.jpg">Photo of Switchmode HeNe Laser Power
Supply Ripple Reducer 1</A>.  It's about 1.7" x 0.7" x 0.75" (WxDxH).
The HV input is at the upper right, the HV output is at the lower right,
and HV ground is between the large HV capacitors at the left.  There's
one extra resistor at the output to limit current in the event of a,
well, unfortunate accident. :)  The only downside to using this
circuit is that it drops about 75 V (at 3.5 mA, proportionally more
at higher current), so the supply must be capable of handling the
additional output voltage.  (Though some adjustment in component values
can cut this more than in half with minimal impact on performance.)  The
input RC reduces the ripple by approximately 50 percent while the transistor
circuit looks like a resistor of under 10K ohms for DC, but
a much higher impedance for AC since C2 maintains a constant voltage
on the base of Q1 over any time scale that matters at the 25 kHz
switching frequency of the supply.  The NE2 seems to provide adequate
protection for Q1, which has survived after a rather large amount of abuse,
except when accidentally installed backwards. :( :)  I'm not sure how the
Melles Griot supply deals with the starting transient.  It looks
likes Q7 there should be obliterated the first time a tube starts.
The NE2 in my circuit always flashes at startup and sometimgs one or
more times at shutdown indicating momentary high voltage across Q1.
<p>
This circuit should work for a tube current up to at least 7 mA with one
minor change: Since the DC voltage across the circuit
may exceed 60 V (the sustaining voltage for a single NE2) for higher
current, it may be necessary to use a pair of NE2s in series.  Or,
the value of R2 can be reduced to say, 150K ohms to keep the voltage
drop below the 60 V sustaning voltage of the NE2, with a very very
slight, likely undetectable increase in ripple.  Alternatives to the
MPSU10 for Q1 include the MJE3439 and 2N3439, as well as the 2SC2271E.
The MPSU10 was handy.  Nothing is critical.  Feel free to experiment
but beware of the high voltage on the capacitors even after powering
off - discharge with 100K to 1M ohms to ground before touching anything!
(The NE2 and LED will flash to indicate discharge is proceeding.)
<p>
With the circuit installed, the capacitor isolated HV AC scope probe shows
50 mV p-p of ripple at the top of the 108K ohm ballast resistor driving
an 05-LHR-006 laser tube.  This ccorresponds to less than 1 uA of
current ripple assuming a net positive tube+ballast resistance of 50K ohms.
(The actual net ballast resistance is probably slightly higher, which means
the ripple is even lower.)  Without the ripple reducer, the voltage ripple was
3.7 V p-p for 74 uA of current ripple.
<p>
Of course, if this isn't good enough, it would be possible to use two such
circuits in series. :)

<h2>Modulation, Demodulation, Pulse Drive</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hpdmdp0">Modulation of HeNe Lasers</A></h3>

Impressing an audio or digital signal on the light beam from a HeNe laser can
be accomplished in a number of ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Electronically by varying the HeNe tube current.  However, this will not
  permit a 100 % variation from full on to full off.  Depending on the
  particular power supply/ballast resistor/HeNe tube combination, going below
  a threshold - perhaps 50% - will result in the tube going out and needind
  to be restarted.  This will depend on combination of the power supply
  voltage, ballast resistor, and tube characteristics.
<p>
  The incremental sensitivity of optical output power to changes in tube
  current is also not linear and always less than 1:1 over the useful range of
  a stable discharge.  Well below the optimal current specification, it is
  more like 1:2 to 1:5 going to 0 at the point of peak optical output (optimal
  current).  Then, the modulation response will turn negative as increasing
  the tube current actually *reduces* optical output.
<p>
  Modulating a HeNe laser beam by controlling the input to the a commercial
  power supply will probably not work due to the filtering in the power supply
  output and possible regulation against just such input voltage variations.
<p>
  However, if you have built one yourself, at least *adjusting* power level in
  this way is probably possible though any output filtering will severely limit
  frequency response.
<p>
  Usually, electronic modulation is accomplished by adding a circuit to the
  return (cathode circuit) of the HeNe tube to control tube current.  In this
  respect, regulators and modulators may be combined.
<p>
  It may also be possible to pulse the power to the HeNe tube (at least for
  low power lasers).  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdmdp8">Pulse
  Type Drive and Modulation of HeNe Tubes</A>.
<p>
<li>Mechanically by introducing a blocker into the beam path in such a way that
  the position of an actuator like a galvo, loudspeaker, or piezo element,
  affects amount of light that emerges.
<p>
<li>Electro-optically using an LCD, Kerr or Pockel's cell; or acousto-optic,
  acousto-elastic, or ferro-optic device.  Some of these devices are way too
  costly for general hobbyist use but you might have salvaged one from an old
  laser printer (one using an HeNe laser) or picked up one cheap at a research
  lab clearance sale. :-)  See the section:
  <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioimdf">Modulation and Deflection</A>.
</ul>
Electronic modulation techniques are covered in the remainder of this chapter.
They are easy to implement and inexpensive.
<p>
However, mechanical and electro-optic approaches do have their advantages
including a potentially much wider modulation intensity range (from full off
to full on, which, as noted, is not really possible with electronic techniques
controlling tube current).  They also do not require any modifications to the
HeNe laser power supply and are thus necessary if this is not possible or
desirable.

<h3><A NAME="hpdmdp1">Electronic Modulation of HeNe Lasers</A></h3>

The basic techniques are all similar and modulate optical output power by
controlling tube current.  These are often combined with the current regulator
or provided as an addition to it or used on a power supply without regulation.
(They cannot be used in addition to regulation as the modulator and regulator
will fight one-another.)
<p>
Several suggestions for implementing power supply output side modulation are
outlined below.  However, the following should be kept in mind:
<p>
<ul>
<li>There is a limited range over which HeNe tubes operate properly.  Too low
  and the discharge will go out; too high and aside from excessive heating,
  the optical output will actually *decrease*.  (Above 2 or 3 times the
  optimal current, output power will probably go to zero.)
<p>
  For example, a tube rated for 4 mA may actually only be usable within a 3 to
  4 mA range.  The low limit depends to some extent on the power supply
  voltage and ballast resistor value - a higher voltage (and ballast resistor)
  will permit the tube to be stable at a lower current.  However, there
  is still a "dropout" current for the tube below which it is impossible
  to run stably.  The high limit will be dependant on when the gain becomes
  negative - the output decreases with increasing current.
<p>
<li>The relationship between tube current and optical output power within the
  range over which the discharge is stable is not very high gain or linear.
  In other words, a large change in current will only result in a small
  change in optical output - you won't get anywhere near 100% modulation.
<p>
<li>As a result of the output power decreasing with current above optimal, the
  phase of the modulated signal will invert and driving it on either side
  of optimal current will result in a full wave rectification effect and
  serious distortion.
<p>
  Thus, the peak current provided by these circuits should be set less than
  or equal to the maximum operating current for your tube.  This involves
  selection of the ballast resistor and power supply and/or regulator current
  set-point.
<p>
<li>It may be possible to actually modulate on the high side of optimal current
  (say 4 to 8 mA resulting in 100 to 10 percent of output power in the example
  above).  Although, there will be some excessive heating of the electrodes,
  for low duty cycle modulation, this may not affect tube life very much if at
  all.  This approach is the only way to actually come anywhere near 100
  percent modulation electronically (without fancy expensive electrooptic
  components).
<p>
  However, note that the actual output power at high currents is not very
  stable (the optical gain is too low) - it will vary as the tube heats.
  Thus, unless a closed loop control scheme is implemented using optical
  feedback, this approach may not be acceptable.  There will also be
  added higher frequency optical noise.
</ul>
<p>
Where wide range (approaching 100 percent) modulation is required, external
electro optical or electro mechanical modulation may be a more effective
solution.
<p>
Depending on the type of information you would like to transmit over the beam
and its bandwidth or data rate, dual tone or some kind of frequency or phase
modulation may be better than simple amplitude modulation.
<p>
With an unregulated HeNe laser power supply, there are no issues with
fighting an active regulator by attempting to control tube current.
However, if doing this with a modern regulated HeNe laser power supply,
care must be taken to make sure the frequency range of the modulation
is beyond the loop response of the regulator or else they will be fighting
and bad things can happen.  This usually means the modulation circuit
should be AC coupled with a low frequency cutoff.  The quiescent current
should be set somewhere in the middle of the range over which the
discharge is stable..
<p>
Note: Some of the following circuits have not been fully tested and
tweaking may be necessary.

<h3><A NAME="hpdmdp2">Modulation Using an Audio or Power Transformer</A></h3>

Add a small audio transformer or low voltage power transformer (in reverse)
with its primary (high impedance/high voltage side) in the return (cathode
end) of the tube and drive its primary from an audio amp or whatever you
like.  You probably want a couple hundred volts at full amplitude.  Just
don't drive it to the point of the tube turning off.

CAUTION: If your tube is mounted with its cathode connected to a metal case
as is the case with typical commercial laser heads, earth ground must be tied
to Tube- for safety as Tube- may be at a potential of several hundred volts

this is not necessary.

<h3><A NAME="hpdmpd3">Modulation Using a High Voltage NPN Transistor</A></h3>

Put a high voltage transistor (e.g., MPSW42) in the return (cathode end)
with a pair of 120 V zener diodes in series across it to prevent the voltage
from going above 240 V.  Bias the transistor to obtain linear control of
tube current.  Then, drive the transistor from your audio signal.  This
is basically a voltage controlled current source.
<p>
The circuit below is designed for a 4 mA operating current.  With R3 set at
200 ohms, a 1 V p-p modulation input will vary the tube current from 1.5 to
6.5 mA.  However, the range of your tube may be much more restricted than this
depending on your tube, power supply voltage, and ballast resistor value.

</PRE>
CAUTION: Do not use this circuit with a tube whose metal housing is not
totally insulated from the user since the cathode will have a potential of
several hundred volts PS- (and the signal return).  For such tubes, see the
alternative circuit below and the section: <A HREF="laserhsc.htm#hscat2">Enhancements to AT-PS1</A> for some
possibilities.
<p>
The use of a transistor like an MJE3439 or MJE2360 would permit a wider
range of control but 200 V is likely to be sufficient.  One of these would
also be needed for higher current tubes since the MPSW42 is only rated at
about 1 W (100 V * 4 mA is .4 W).  A vacuum tube triode or high voltage
FET in a similar configuration could even be used.  The tube would be kind
of quaint. :-)  See the section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdmdp5">Modulation Using a Vacuum Tube</A> for
details.
<p>
The Vceo rating for such a transistor may need to be several hundred volts
depending on your HeNe tube and power supply, ballast resistor value, and
how much modulation is desired.  The voltage divider formed by R1 and R2
and emitter resistor R3 set the operating current and voltage across the
transistor with no signal.
<p>
A small HeNe tube will have perhaps 1,200 V across it and 300 V across the
ballast resistor at the recommended operating current.  The voltage across
the tube (a negative resistance discharge device), will be more or less
constant around the operating current (but may increase as the current is
reduced).  It is the 300 V that you have to play with.  If the transistor
drops 150 V, the ballast resistor will only drop 150 V and the current will
be cut in half.
<p>
The compliance range for the circuit shown is about 200 V so a ballast
resistor still needs to be selected to enable the regulation to be effective
from 0 to maximum modulation.
<p>
Use the procedure described in the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserhps.htm#hpsbrf0">Selecting the
Ballast Resistor</A> to determine an appropriate ballast resistor value for the
desired tube current and a power supply voltage 100 V less than that of your
(unregulated) supply.  This circuit should then maintain that current constant
with no audio input and permit modulation of the current on either side of the
set-point up to a change of approximately +/-100/Rb mA.

<h3><A NAME="hpdmdp5">Modulation Using a Vacuum Tube</A></h3>

Transistors like the MJE3439, MJE2360T, or even the MPSW92 or MPSW42 are
generally adequate for these tasks.  A high voltage MOSFET can also be used.
However, if you long for the warm quaint glow of a vacuum tube (valve, for
those of you on the other side of the pond!), a similar approach is easily
implemented with common (well they used to be common) miniature receiving
tubes.  In the tube's defense, it may be more difficult to fry tubes than
semiconductors!
<p>
If I recall anything about tubes (which was a long time ago) select a cathode
resistor to bias the grid negative to set the laser tube operating current
(less than its maximum) and then drive the grid from a voltage source like
the speaker output of an audio amplifier.  The voltage on the plate will then
vary resulting in an incremental current change of roughly: delta(Vin)/TC
where TC is the transconductance of the vacuum tube at its operating point.
<p>
For example, using a 12BH7A medium mu twin triode (you can use the other half
for a fabulous audio preamp!), the grid voltage will need to be in the range
-0 to -30 V for a compliance range of 400 V.  At a plate voltage of 250 V, TC
is 3,100 umhos resulting in an overall sensitivity of about 3.1 mA/V.  Thus,
this circuit would work quite nicely with line level audio signals since a
total variation of only 1 to 3 mA should be needed to modulate a typical HeNe
laser tube.
<p>
In the circuit below, R2 and R3 set the bias point depending on the current
requirements of your HeNe tube, power supply output voltage, and ballast
resistor.  C2 is the cathode bypass capacitor (low frequency roll off of
around 20 Hz at the minimum (higher current) setting of R3).

Where to find a 12BH7A?  Actually finding a new one may be difficult and
expensive (I have heard of a retail price of around $50 - wow!  In its day,
that tube probably went for $2 - and most of the difference isn't due to
inflation.)  I just selected the 12BH7A (out of the RCA Receiving Tube Manual,
1970 edition) as a triode with a suitable maximum plate voltage rating.  Many
many other tube types (likely cheaper also - the 12BH7A seems to be even more
expensive than other similar tubes for some reason - will work as well.  Or,
just go to a hamfest or electronics flea market - people are always unloading
old tubes.  Or, check out a few garage or yard sales - you can probably pick
up several old (but not yet antique) tube type radios for less than the cost
of a single new vacuum tube!

Of course, if you really want to impress your friends, use a transmitting tube
like a 6146, 1625, 811, or even an Eimac 3-1000Z - that's good for a kW!

just a single transistor circuit to change it to a voltage.  Then, output that
to an audio amp.  See the section: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioilpm1">Sam's Super Cheap and Dirty Laser Power
Meter</A> for a starting point.  The maximum modulation index is probably 15
percent or less so you will need to null out the DC offset or AC couple the
output (which the audio amp will probably do anyhow).

<h3><A NAME="hpdmdp7">Pulsing a HeNe Laser for High Power?</A></h3>

Unlike solid state (e.g., ruby, Nd:YAG) lasers which produce extremely intense
short pulses of light, HeNe lasers really are continuous wave devices.  It is
not possible to obtain high peak power from a HeNe laser by driving it harder,
Q-switching, or other exotic techniques.
<p>
A high voltage power supply that produces short pulses exceeding the tube's
starting requirements will result in output pulses of light.  With appropriate
design, pulse duration and repetition rate can be controlled.  Depending on
needs, a flyback transformer or automotive ignition coil may be suitable.  The
stability of the beam on such short times scales may be questionable and high
repetition rate pulsing may result in shortened tube life as well.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdmdp8">Pulse Type Drive and Modulation of HeNe Tubes</A>.
<p>
As with modulation, mechanical or electro-optic techniques are also possible.
A simple chopper wheel in the beam path may be perfectly adequate for your
needs and a lot less complex and costly than high tech alternatives!

<h3><A NAME="hpdmdp8">Pulse Type Drive and Modulation of HeNe Tubes</A></h3>

While you can amplitude modulate the tube directly, the index of modulation
that can be achieved in this manner is not very high.  For a typical power
supply and tube combo, you will be lucky to get a 5 or 6 percent modulation
index before the tube wants to go out.  By increasing the ballast resistor and
using a higher power supply voltage, this may be increased to perhaps 15 or 20
percent which is still pretty pathetic.  You won't talk very far using this
approach as most of the carrier power is wasted.  It is possible to modulate
on the high side of optimal current (increasing current decrease the optical
output) and achieve a high modulation index but this will reduce tube life
(it takes 2 to 3 times the optimal current to reduce optical output to zero).
<p>
HeNe tubes can be pulsed - there is no law that says DC must be used.
<p>
However, to achieve rated (or even just reasonable) tube life and output
power, discharge current must be controlled within specified limits.  This may
not be quite as trivial as suggested below - especially for larger HeNe tubes!
<p>
WARNING: The comments below apply to the low power (0.5 to 1 mW) HeNe lasers
found in bar code (UPC) scanners and similar products.  If you attempt this
with a 35 mW HeNe laser, you may blow the tube, burn out the power supply, fry
yourself (or all of the above) in the process.
<p>
(Portions of the following from: K. Sorter (w1_k_sorter@qsl.net).)
<p>
Modulation methods are a primary discussion amongst our group although many
are now converting to IR (invisible) lasers and IR sensitive PM tubes and APDs
for long range work (Mia and Rayleigh scattering/adsorption effects are much
less severe in the atmosphere at IR).
<p>
High index of amplitude modulation is not possible by smoothing varying the
input to a HeNe tube.  As soon as the the supply voltage/current is reduced
slightly, the tube winks out.  However, it was found that the HeNe tubes could
be pulsed at about 30 khz by simply removing the filter capacitors in the
small switching power supplies used with low power HeNe lasers (yes, they were
not potted!)  Presto - the units had a 100 percent index of modulation!  These
supplies and tubes are common and cheap in rejected scanner units that are
upgraded to diode lasers.
<p>
Therefore, to get the highest index of modulation (and therefore the most
miles per watt), you will need to switch the tube on and off at 20 to 50 kHz.
This means running the tube on AC or pulsating DC.  Unfortunately, there are a
couple of issues that may prevent the successful modification of surplus HeNe
power supplies:
<ul>
<li>Many power supply models are totally potted in Epoxy which is impossible to
  remove without destroying what is inside.  Thus, these are impossible to
  modify.  Some may be potted in a rubbery type material which can be (very
  laboriously) removed.  The best (for our purposes) are not potted at all
  but are simply conformal coated with a high voltage sealer.
<p>
<li>There are a variety of power supply designs in common use and not all of
  them can be modified in this way.  Problems may arise with the way starting
  and current regulation are implemented as well as with the design of the
  secondary components on the switching transformer - rectifiers, filter
  capacitors, and voltage multiplier circuitry.  In general, the simpler the
  power supply design, the more likely that modification is easy or even
  possible - a basic inverter, rectifiers, filter capacitor, and separate
  starting (multiplier) circuit.
</ul>
One user vividly recounted purchasing a bag full of decommissioned 12 VDC low
power HeNe tubes and PS units at a swap meet. These were replaced with newer
laser diode types, so the old stuff was junk, and was sold cheap.  These were
from old style supermarket scanning units!
<p>
This was followed by a brief discussion in which the question of switching the
laser on and off (a destructive process) was discussed, and it was determined
that there was a big difference between keeping the plasma lit while pulsing
the laser on and off AND turning the tube completely on and off and restriking
the plasma (as in a cold start).
<p>
Note that the tube continues to have internal plasma during the 'off periods',
but that the tubes didn't lase until the pulse came along and the input
voltage got high enough.  A photodiode placed against the tube envelope showed
constant output all the time with higher levels when the tube lased. The
output of the tube however would go completely on and off (at the output
mirror of the tube). 
<p>
IMPORTANT: In this type of operation, the starting pulse is only applied
initially to start the process-if the starting pulse was applied 30 or 40
thousand times per second, the tube would be destroyed in short order. 
<p>
Some tube manufacturers say that pulses are OK, others suggest raw AC with
appropriate current limiting resistors.  At the prices of these things (as
in: dirt cheap), experimentation is encouraged!
<p>
You can also use the laser in relaxation oscillator mode by simply putting a
capacitor across it. It will oscillate at a fairly constant frequency,
although modifying that frequency (for voice/data transmission) is not so
easy. It is useful if you need a constant monotone output.  However, whether
this will lead to significantly reduced tube life will depend on the actual
frequency of the relaxation oscillator as well as the type of starting circuit
used in the power supply.  Above a frequency of perhaps several kHz, the
discharge will restrike without requiring the normal high starting voltage
(and the power supply's starting circuit will not be activated).  If the
time constant is too long (too low a frequency), the tube would need to cold
start each time.  Repetitive application of a high energy starting pulse
may result in rapid degradation of the tube characteristics.
<p>
I (K. Sorter) used a .05 uF disk capacitor and ran my 2 mW HeNe tube in that
mode for 2 weeks constantly. The starter pulse in the power supply was
activated by a relay, so each time I would turn on the supply, it would click.
There would be no clicking while running in relaxation oscillator mode.  Thus,
the power supply thought the tube was running normally.  The purist might
believe this would lead to degraded life expectancy of the tube, but it hasn't
been proven in actual real life. 
<p>
You then FM modulate the 20 kHz frequency with your desired audio.  There are
various ways of doing this by injecting the audio signal into the frequency
determining circuitry of the pulse width regulator chip.  This specifics will,
of course, depend on the design of your particular power supplies.
<p>
The receiver is tuned to the carrier frequency and demodulates the FM signal.
This can be easily accomplished with a NE556 chip and photodiode/low noise
op-amp front-end.
<p>
The best deal in optical front ends these days is the Burr-Brown OPA210/OPA211
op amp/photodiode in a chip combo at 8 bucks! You add an appropriate external
feedback resistor (depending on the desired bandwidth), and you have the whole
front-end in a simple chip!
<p>
It should be noted that FM is a poor performer if your goal is long distance
communications!  But it certainly can have near broadcast quality audio which
is a big advantage if that's your goal.
<p>
We have many users that are using this strategy in communications everyday.

<h2>Powering Multple HeNe Tubes or Discharges, Remote Operation</h2>
<h3><A NAME="hpdpmh0">Driving Multiple HeNe Tubes (or Discharges) from a Single Power Source</A></h3>

In general, attempting to design a single power supply to drive multiple HeNe
tubes in series or parallel is more trouble than it is worth:
<ul>
<li>HeNe tubes in series: This is probably just a bad idea.  Starting voltage,
  operating voltage, and minimum ballast resistor size (to account for the
  total negative resistance) will be multiplied by the number of HeNe tubes.
  Even doing this with a pair of tiny .5 mW HeNe tubes would require a power
  supply which will be proportionately much more expensive than two smaller
  ones.
<p>
<li>HeNe tubes in parallel: For line powered units, the AC input circuitry and
  operating voltage supply can be shared.  However, separate starters and
  regulators (or some other way to balance the currents) will be needed for
  each HeNe tube connection.  This would be more difficult for regulated
  inverter type designs with primary side controllers.
</ul>
However, when driving specialized, older, or very large HeNe tubes, there are
cases where this approach may make sense.  Since you may need to construct a
custom power supply to meet the non-standard tube requirements anyhow, this
could result in a significant cost savings:

<h3><A NAME="hpdpmh1">Driving Multiple HeNe Tubes or One with a Center-Tapped Discharge Tube</A></h3>

Where there is a center-tapped discharge tube, two similar power feeds are
needed (in effect, there are two HeNe tubes in parallel probably sharing a
common cathode).  Only a single operating voltage supply with its associated
AC line circuitry is needed.  Since the characteristics of the two discharge
paths are likely very similar, further simplifications may be possible for
current balancing and/or regulation.
<p>
A typical circuit is shown below where the characteristics of the tubes are
sufficiently similar that separate current regulators are not required.

(Note that separate cathode feeds probably will not exist on a center-tapped
discharge tube.)
<p>
Rb1 and Rb2 are the ballast resistors.  Where no separate regulators are used,
one or both of these can include a suitable variable resistor and/or trimming
resistors can be added to balance the currents.  Just be sure to use a well
insulated tool or adjust with power off and capacitors confirmed to be
discharged!
<p>
This approach can easily be extended to more than two HeNe tubes.
<p>
The starter can be a voltage multiplier or inverter type.  Note that since
the HeNe tubes will not start at exactly the same time, Ri1 and Ri2 (the HV
isolating resistors) must have a high enough resistance so that the starter
supply is not loaded down excessively even when all but the last HeNe tube
has started.  It may also be possible to use a large pulse type starter
applied to points S1 and S2 via HV coupling capacitors.
<p>
It is desirable to connect the return (-) of the starter supply to HV+ to
take advantage of the additional boost provided by the operating voltage
supply.  Where the return cannot be isolated, it will have to be connected
to ground.  CR1 and CR2 are HV diodes to bypass operating current around the
starters once the discharge is initiated.

<h3><A NAME="hpdpmh2">Driving Multiple HeNe Tubes with an Exposed
 Capillary</A></h3>

Where the capillary is accessible (the gas reservoir is separate, not
surrounding the capillary as with common mass produced internal mirror HeNe
tubes), starting can be accomplished using the output of a pulse transformer
but applied to an electrode external to the tube (rather than in series with
the anode).  This is similar to triggering a xenon flash lamp.  See the
section: <A HREF="laserhpd.htm#hpdhns4">Starting Circuits Using Pulse or
Flyback Transformers</A> and the document:

<p>
If the tube cathodes can be isolated from ground, current monitoring can be
accomplished by adding sense resistors (Rs1 and Rs2) and measuring voltage at
Test1 and Test2 (1 mA/V) or with a 10 or 20 mA full scale current meter to
these.  If this is not possible, one alternative is to use a single sense
resistor (Rs) and run only one HeNe tube at a time while adjusting current
making sure that the input voltage is identical in each case.
