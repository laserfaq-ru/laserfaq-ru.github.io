<h2>System Maintenance and Adjustments</h2>
<h3><A NAME="strcln">Cleaning a Laser Rod</A></h3>

There are two issues: The sides of the rod and the (probably) AR coated ends.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The cleanliness of the sides is critical not because of any optical
 effects but any finger oils or other contamination will absorb the light
 (UV in particular) from the flashlamp resulting in hot spots and
 discoloration.  Hot spots can ultimately damage the rod and if nothing else,
 the decomposed areas will absorb some of the pump energy.  Don't touch
 any part of the rod with unprotected fingers before or after cleaning!
<p>
<li>The ends should be cleaned in the same way as other delicate optical
 surfaces using methanol or acetone and the 'drop and drag' technique.
</ul>
<p>
(From: heru_kuti@yahoo.com.)
<p>
Two words VERY GENTLY!!!!! The best way to clean laser optical surfaces is not
to dirty them. If you inevitably get it dusty blow it off with compressed dry
air. If some dirt remains it is best to clean with a piece of REAL lens tissue
and very pure acetone being very gentle on it. If you get it badly dirty, like
as if some yahoo from the machine shop touched it before washing his hands,
the only course is to really wash it. To do this, first dust off as much as
you can, next rinse in warm clean water. follow up by washing with a cotton
ball and warm detergent/water solution. (Clean water with CLEAR dish soap
works well.) Finally rinse with distilled water followed by pure acetone.

<h3><A NAME="strrmr">Laser Rod Mounting and Removal</A></h3>

The ruby, YAG, or other rods in solid state lasers are often mounted in
holders using some adhesive, probably Epoxy.
<p>
(From: Klaus Dupre (dupre@fee-io.de).)
<p>
Sometimes the rod holders are fixed with epoxy glue or other glues. Than you
may have problems removing the holders without damaging the rod and/or the
holders.   You may chip the ends and thus require regrinding, polishing and
coating.
<p>
There are two methods to remove the glue:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Heat the rod to about 250&deg;C, this will destroy the glue (or make it
 softer) and you can pull the holders from the rod. With some luck the
 end-faces will have no or only small damages, but you will have to clean
 them very carefully.
<p>
<li>Put the rod with the holders in hot acidic acid, this will destroy the
 glue, the holders and the coating, but its the best way to protect the rod.
</ol>
<p>
(From: Elliot Burke (elliot@nonamehitide.com).)
<p>
Before using aggressive means to undo an Epoxy bond, you might try methyl
bromide.  This is available as "Milsolve" from Summers Laboratories.  It
dissolves Epoxy.  If you use this stuff, be sure to obtain and read the MSDS.
Methyl bromide is much more aggressive than methylene chloride on Epoxy.
<p>
Good practice for use of solvents is to soak things in them in a covered
container.  Rags with solvent in them should be disposed of carefully.  At
least bag them before they releast all the solvent into your local air.
I leave a few windows open.
<p>
(From: Josh Halpern (vze23qvd@mail.verizon.net).)
<p>
Believe it or not many Epoxys can be "rotted off" if left overnight in
methanol, which is somewhat safer to use than methylene chloride.

<h3><A NAME="strass">Aligning a Solid State Laser</A></h3>

Many small solid state lasers do not have anything to adjust - the mirrors are
fastened to fixed mounts using indexing pins for alignment and there is no
Q-switch or other cavity components that can be moved.  So, the only required
maintenance would be to inspect and clean the optical surfaces.
<p>
Where there are adjustments, the wide bore, planar mirrors, and high gain of
the typical solid state laser make alignment quite straightforward for once. :)
The same basic principles apply as with HeNe and Ar/Kr ion laser alignment
(see the sections starting with: <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrail">External Mirror
Laser Cleaning and Alignment Techniques</A> for details) but due to the orders
of magnitude more gain, you only need to get close for the system to start
lasing.  Disks with small holes will be useful to center the alignment beam
in the cavity and for IR emitting lasers (like YAG at 1,064 nm), some means
of detecting the beam such as an IR sensitive camera and Zapit paper will be
needed.  Once the cavity is roughly aligned, the Q-switch (if present) is
installed and aligned to the beam path.  This can still take a long time -
hours - especially if you haven't done it before.
<p>
Note that Zapit paper is great for this but there are many common materials
that will behave similarly including common packaging (anything with dark
ink on a light colored cardboard base).  Even 5-1/4" diskettes (either the
envelope or the diskette itself) can be pressed into service.  Now you
have a use for those cartons of antiquated storage media.  Other magnetic
media like data and video tape may also work because they consist of a very
thin dark layer on a clear base material.  Don't toss those crinkled VHS
tapes! :)
<p>
The following applies to a typical medium-to-large ruby or YAG Q-switched
pulsed laser:
<p>
(From: Christopher R. Carlen (crcarle@sandia.gov).)
<p>
Typically to align a laser, you set up a reference beam from a HeNe laser
through the cavity.  With a solid state laser, you may want to ensure the rod
is centered on the high reflector and output coupler optics.  Then with the
OC removed, align the HR to aim the HeNe back into itself.  The same is done
with the OC.  
<p>
With a Q-switch (Q-sw), the situation is complicated.  What might be advisable
if the assembly is simple enough, is to remove the Q-sw from the cavity
and align the laser without it.  Than, if it lases, at least you know
that there is no optical problem with the rod, HR, or OC.  And you may
be able to just pop the Q-sw components back in while retaining the non
Q-switched cavity alignment.  Note, this may not be possible unless you
at least align the cavity first with the polarizer, as some translation
and perhaps off-axis pointing of the beam will result from it.  So that
means: align initially without the Pockel's cell and 1/4 wave plate, but
with the polarizer.
<p>
It is then a matter of figuring out if there is something wrong with the
Q-sw, polarizer, or 1/4 wave plate (Note all of this assumes that the
Q-sw uses this common topology).
<p>
If the Q-sw optics look OK and are clean, (DO NOT clean them unless you
really know how to clean laser optics), then reinstall the Q-sw
components.  (Also note if the Pockel's cell is filled with liquid.  It
should be.  If it is dry, it is probably no good.)  Since the HeNe beam
is of a different wavelength from the ruby laser, it may be difficult to
verify proper operation of the Q-sw using the HeNe.  However, if you
have access to a 670nm, 680nm, or ideally a 690nm laser diode, that
wavelength would be close enough to the ruby's 694nm to use the diode
laser as an alignment reference (assuming you can get a reasonably
circular and collimated beam).  Then you can align the polarizer to
Brewster's angle by orienting the polarization of the ref. beam for a
P-bounce off the polarizer.  Adjust the angle of incidence for a minimum
reflection.  At that point, with the Pockel's cell still out of the
cavity, the beam that passes through the polarizer will pass through the
1/4 wave plate, reflect off the HR, bounce back through the 1/4 wave
plate, and be reflected out of the cavity by the polarizer.  That is
because the two passes through the 1/4 wave plate caused a 90 degree
polarization rotation, resulting in a S-bounce off the polarizer, which
is a high reflectivity incident condition.
<p>
Now there are complexities to getting the Pockel's cell aligned that are
deeper than what we are into already.  But assuming you can get it
close, the situation described above should not be altered by its
presence.  However, if you can arrange to apply a constant voltage to
the Pockel's cell that is identical to the voltage applied by the power
supply to produce an output pulse, you should find that the reflection
off the polarizer (the reflection of light out of the cavity of the beam
that has bounced off the HR) no longer appears, or is effectively gone
(it will be very faint).  So that is the proper operation of the Q-sw: 
No voltage on the Pockel's cell=strong reflection of light from the
polarizer.  Voltage on Pockel's cell=minimal reflection off the polarizer.
<p>
If you can get this far, there is a good chance you can run in
Q-switched mode now.
<p>
If you can get some YAG or ruby laser manuals from other lasers with
alignment procedures, do so.  Of course, the holy grail would be the
manual for your laser.
<p>
(From: C. Bollig.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>We attach a cardboard screen to the front of the HeNe with a small
 hole for the beam to come through.
<p>
<li>We align the HeNe beam in such a way that its beam is along the
 axis we want the final laser to operate at. The Nd rod can already be
 in place but need not be as long as its faces are truly parallel. We
 either position the HeNe in such a way that the beam goes the right
 way or we use a single metal mirror to reflect the beam into the
 right direction.
<p>
<li>We position the flat mirror which is furthest away from the HeNe
 so that it reflects straight back. Once it is almost perfect, it will
 often start to interfere with the HeNe so that you can see power
 fluctuations.
<p>
<li>We do the same with the other flat mirror. We often put a piece of
 paper in between, so that the reflection from the first mirror (and
 the rod if present) is blocked.
<p>
<li>We take the paper out just to double-check that all the
 reflections go straight back. At this stage, we normally see quite
 some interference.
<p>
<li>We leave the HeNe aligned but switch it of and switch the Nd-laser
 on. Normally, it would lase straight away. If not, we wobble a bit on
 the mounts by hand to see if we are close (often a very successful
 technique). If nothing helps, we switch the Nd-pump of again and the
 HeNe on again to go through the alignment once more.
<p>
<li>At some stage we do get it lasing. The rest is optimization."
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="strhpa">Comments on High Power SS Laser Alignment</A></h3>

The following were in response to questions about misalignment of a particular
model Q-switched YAG laser but apply in general to many similar systems.
(Also see the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strdnr">Discussion About Nd:YAG
Laser Repair</A>)
<p>
<blockquote>
"Oops... it happened.  We moved into our new lab space and one of the
 Quanta-Ray DCR-11 Nd:YAG lasers got bumped."
</blockquote>
<p>
Realignment from scratch isn't a trivial job if you haven't done it before.
It involves removing everything from the optical cavity and subsequently
lining components up with the aid of a HeNe laser.  If you hare a real budget,
letting the laser manufacturer or a reputable laser service company do it may
be best since aside from the safety issues, damage to the laser crystals and
optics are quite possible if alignment isn't perfect.  But, here are some
comments and suggestions along with the risks if you want to play:
<p>
(From: David Demmer (ddemmer@physics.utoronto.ca).)
<p>
And a word of caution here: These DCR's tend to operate pretty close to the
limit of what their guts can handle. Operation anywhere near full power
with a misaligned cavity is almost guaranteed to blow up some internal
component, such as your YAG rod or Pockels cell.
<p>
If you attempt this yourself, you must remember to do all the alignment with
the laser "free-running", i.e., not Q-switched. Use some diagnostic aid like
Zapit(tm) (burn) paper or a CCD camera to look at your beam profile. Don't
Q-switch the thing until the beam profile is perfectly symmetric, and
therefore well-aligned.

<h3><A NAME="strilc">Issues of Liquid Cooling in SS Lasers</A></h3>

(From: Steve Quest (Squest@cris.com).)
<p>
Why do you think we charge so much to setup and tear down a YAG laser.
YAGs have external and internal cooling water.  The internal water is
deionized (distilled, without minerals or salts that cause ions) also
called anionic water.  Anionic water doesn't conduct electricity, so it
<b>CAN</b> come into contact with electrodes and cause no harm.  Our system
flows water across the pumping lamp, and YAG rod to cool them, then circulates
the heat-bearing water across a stainless steel heat exchanger which
couples the heat to cold tap water, and dumps the heat-bearing tap water
down the drain.  Efficient, eh?  I want to get a chiller someday.

<h2>SS Laser System Repair</h2>

<h3><A NAME="strdnr">Discussion About Nd:YAG Laser Repair</A></h3>

<blockquote>
"I and a colleague tried several things: replacing the flashlamp, tweaking the
 front and back mirrors, replacing the deionized water in the closed-cycle
 cooling system, but none of these steps improved the output."
</blockquote>

(From: Jim Cavera (jcavera@alcnet.com).)
<p>
Try checking the crystal.  Nd:YAG crystals are prone to heat-induced,
microscopic fractures.  Enough of these can drop the output energy
considerably or even extinguish lasing altogether.  CAREFULLY remove
the crystal (no dust or oil, please, or even fingerprints, and be
particularly careful of the AR coating that most crystal manufacurers
add) and put it under a good optical microscope.  What you would be 
looking for are site inclusions and fractures that cut across the axis
of the crystal.
<p>
NOTE : this is probably the last thing you would want to check.  Try
everything else first.  Nd:YAGs are simple creatures though, and it
sounds like you have everything else pretty well covered.
<p>
(From: Rick Fletcher (fletcher@news.uidaho.edu).)
<p>
Definitely the last thing!  Check the cavity condition (corrosion, algae,
etc.) before doing this.  Also, make sure you do not have a damaged optic,
like a cracked quarter wave plate, etc.
<p>
(From: Joshua Halpern (jbh@idt.net).)
<p>
One of the things that may be wrong is the Q-switch.  Turn the laser to long
pulse (Q-switch off) and see if you get full power or near. If so the Q-switch
is the problem.  The easiest thing would be if the Q-switch delay is set
incorrectly.  It's just a matter of turning a dial.
<p>
Next you need to look.  First get some exposed Polaroid film and put it in a
baggie.  Then hold it in front of the laser for one shot.  Hopefully you still
have enough power to get a burn pattern.  This should be symmetric (I forget
whether the JK had a near gaussian or a "doughnut" pattern).  If you see ugly
striations, you either have a very badly adjusted laser or some burns.
<p>
You have probably "misaligned" the laser when you tweaked the lamps.  YAGs,
expecially the oscillators are better tuned for beam shape than pulse power.
<p>
Next remove all the beam tubes and look carefully at the mirrors, rod ends,
polarizer and Q-switch for burns.  TURN THE LASER OFF FIRST.
<p>
You probably will need a dentist's mirror and a small flashlight.  Maglites
are great for this.  The best way is to hold the light at a high angle to the
perpendicular and look directly at the component, but you may have to move the
light and your head to see this.
<p>
Then put a piece of white paper behind the laser head and use the flashlight
to illuminate it, while looking through the rod with your dental mirror.  This
should give you a much better idea about what is going on.
<p>
The hint about looking at the cavity is also good.
<p>
JK was represented in the US by Lumonics, who appear to have gone out of the
scientific laser business, but they may know someone who still does servicing
(They are in Ottawa, Canada).
<p>
Finally there are lots of folks in chemistry and physics at NIST who operate
YAGs and can give you some idea of how to proceed.

<h3><A NAME="strgpr">Grinding and Polishing a Laser Rod</A></h3>

The bottom line is that unless you have no choice, refuse any offers of low
cost 'slightly chipped or otherwise damaged solid state laser rods, or those
that just need a little finishing! :)  These show up regularly on eBay and
elsewhere.  The general consensus is that they should be avoided despite the
attractive prices.
<p>
Note, also, that rods sold in this condition may have failed other preliminary
quality tests including not having the proper percentage or uniform doping or
being cut from a portion of the original crystal which had optical defects.
Presumably, the manufacturer would not have gone to the trouble to cut them
(to the rod shape) if they were total garbage but who knows?
<p>
The first comments are for ruby and the second for YAG.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Sadly, ruby is about the second hardest mineral on the planet to polish.
Most commercially available abrasives don't even scratch it and you need a
optical grade finish or the rod ends will blow off.  A less then perfect
finish greatly increases the lasing threshold.  A flat takes two lapping
rigs (one slightly spherical, one slightly concave) made of a material of
slightly less hardness then the ruby, and a lot of different sizes of
abrasives.  You could start at a local lapidary shop and have them saw the
ends, but they must be parallel to within 1/2' or so, then try to lap it
down following the instructions in an amateur telescope making book.  
<p>
By the time you go through all this, including buying a optical flat to
check the ends and a HeNe laser to measure parallelism, plus practicing
on a couple of glass rods, you could buy the whole head from say Meredith or
Midwest in working order for less cost.  Your other option is to have one of
the laser rebuild companies that do ruby and YAG, such as Kentek, repolish
it for you.
<p>
(From: L. Michael Roberts (NewsMail@laserfx.com).)
<p>
I called a friend. He makes YAG optics. I think most are smallish.  Here are
some notes for YAG in particular:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting (sawing): Regular diamond saw.
<p>
<li>Grinding: Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is slow but OK for little parts.
 Silicon carbide (SiC) (He thinks, he was away from his notes) is faster but
 more expensive.  Diamond is nice.
<p>
<li>Polishing: Phenolic lap (Like a lapidary lab?) is OK but there will be
 some roll off (I think he said that).  Ceramic lap is great and fast, etc.
 Pitch lap (very slow) for high power stuff (I think this is to avoid
 subsurface damage).  For polishing media, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
 (Linde?) is OK.  He mentioned colloidal SiO<sub>2</sub>.  He also mentioned
 diamond.
</ul>
<p>
He said to get a book on polishing YAG in a lapidary store. 
<p>
I would bet though, that normal lapidary techniques won't yield anything like
1/4 wave optics.  Perhaps the addition of keepers to normal lapidary practice
would get you into that realm.  
<p>
(From: Clive Washingtron (clive.washington@astrazeneca.com).)
<p>
A section of the jewelry/lapidary community, those who
facet gemstones, may be able to do this - and there are several thousand
such people worldwide.  Some cutters just turn out 'ordinary' stones but a
few of us aspire to high optical quality.  Do you have any idea of just how
flat the end faces need to be?  On a quarter inch facet I could easily
achieve 3 or 4 rings so perhaps it would be possible!
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Yes, I think it may be possible to achieve sufficient flatness to get it to
lase, but probably not to achieve the original performance.  By "3 or 4 rings"
I assume you mean interference fringes where flatness specs are often in 1/10
or 1/20 lambda.  However, all that is needed is a stable round trip path in the
resonator to get it to lase, but that could still result in a messed up beam and
reduced output power.  There is also the issue of applying an antireflection
or mirror coating to the rod ends.
<p>
One purpose of my strong comments is to discourage people who think they can
simply buy a cheap unpolished or damaged rod on eBay and all it will take is a
few minutes to grind it flat free-hand using 1,200 grit sandpaper and then
polish it (also free-hand) with jeweler's rouge! :)

<h3><A NAME="strskc">Salvaging the Damaged KTP Crystal in a DPSS Laser</A></h3>

A chipped or broken KTP (or other) non-linear crystal may still be fully
usable without major work if there is at least some remaining clear area
at both ends.  This is particularly applicable to intracavity frequency
doubled DPSS lasers since the beam diameter at both ends of the KTP is
generally very small compared to the actual dimensions of the KTP so there
is a lot of "spare" crystal available.  Whether this is applicable to other
types of lasers would need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
<p>
Stock KTP crystals generally have a cross-section of 2x2 or 3x3 mm, though some
commercial DPSS lasers use 1x1 mm crystals.  The typical maximum beam diameter
at the crystal faces is typically less than 200 um, possibly less than
100 um.  To minimize diffraction losses, space equal to the beam diameter
should be allowed surrounding the beam so a 100 um intracavity beam would
require a 300 um area on the crystal.  So, if there is a small undamaged
area remaining, repair may be possible using the existing KTP with minimal
rework.
<p>
The main challenges are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mounting:</b> In principle, a clear area 3 times the maximum diameter
 of the intracavity beam should be adequate but cutting it that close means
 that precise mounting becomes a real challenge.  And, depending on the phase
 matching angle, the beam may not enter and exit at the same location at both
 ends of the crystal.  One further complication is that the AR coatings may
 not extend to the edges or corners and the clear area must also be one
 that's AR coated to get any decent performance.
<p>
 Where the original holder has no adjustments but assumes the beam is
 in a particular location, it may be necessary to grind down the sides of
 the crystal so the clear area can be positioned precisely where it is needed.
 KTP is relative soft and files designed for metal actually appear to
 work reasonably well.  But make sure to protect the very delicate coated
 ends.
<p>
 Two part Epoxy or UV cure adhesive can be used to attach the crystal to
 the holder.  Depending on how many degrees of freedom are available
 for the holder, the orientation of the KTP may be critical, both in
 terms of rotation about the optical axis of the laser and the angle
 with respect to the optical axis.
<p>
<li><b>Cleaning:</b> The typical crystal will be AR coated at both ends.
 These coatings may be less robust than those on other optics.  Therefore,
 an absolute minimum of cleaning is essential.  I don't know which solvents
 are best.  Using 91% isopropyl alcohol on one piece of KTP seemed to result
 in some tendency for the coating to come off near the edges.
</ul>
<p>
I've successfully remounted the damaged KTP crystals in a couple of DPSS
lasers.  On one, the KTP crystal was chipped at one end with about half of the
face totally missing.  The entire mount had to be fabricated from scratch
as the previous owner had lost the original parts (though the mount wasn't
very good to begin with, which is perhaps why the crystal got damaged).
See the section: <A HREF="lasercds.htm#cdsrd80">Reconstruction of an 80 mW
Green DPSSFD Laser</A>.  The other was a Uniphase SLM uGreen DPSS laser where
the 3x3x3 mm KTP crystal had been shattered by threading a screw too deeply
into its mount.  Only a small area in one corner was still usable.  The KTP
had to be filed down so the good area could be centered in the beam but the
original holder then could be used.

<h3><A NAME="strqsf">Multiple Pulses From Rangefinder Laser</A></h3>

Lasers designed for time-of-flight ranging usually use a Q-switch to produce
a single intense pulse.  A failure where multiple weak pulses are generated
instead points to a problem with the Q-switch.  There are several types of
Q-switches:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Mechanical Q-switch (Hughes M-60 tank rangefinder).  Most failures would
 result in no output at all but if the motor wasn't turning and the mirror or
 prism just happened to line up, there could still be some weak or erratic
 output pulses.  However, such a failure of this type of Q-switch is highly
 unlikely.
<p>
<li>Passive Q-switch using a bleachable dye cell, Hughes M-1 rangefinder).
 Damage to the dye cell could result in it bleaching prematurely resulting in
 a series of weak pulses.  If the dye cell was broken or missing, the output
 would be similar to that of a non-Q-switched laser.
<p>
<li>Pockels or other electro-optic Q-switch (medical, scientific, and research
 lasers).  Misalignment or electrical problems could result in improper
 operation.
</ol>
</p>
Modern compact rangefinders are likely to use the passive Q-switch technique
of (2) and problems with the dye cell are common (probably just behind
flashlamp failures).  Dye cells can be replaced.  For example, the Hughes M-1
unit shown in <A HREF="ssy1a.jpg">SSY1 Laser Head Assembly</A> uses such a
dye cell attached near the end of the Nd:YAG rod.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclsy1">A Small Nd:YAG Laser - SSY1</A> for more info.

<h3><A NAME="strbqh">Problems with Beam Quality of High Energy Pulses</A></h3>

The following comments were prompted by a complaint that a particular pulsed
laser produced a TEM00 beam only when it was run well below its published
output power/energy specifications.
<p>
(From: billyfish@aol.com).)
<p>
One of my pet peeves in laser specification is the attempt to get maximum
energy out instead of maximum peak brightness (radiance). In most cases,
although not all, high brightness is preferred over gross energy. Once energy
is stored in the rod, there is only a certain amount that can feed into forming
a TEMOO mode. As the energy that can support that mode is used up, there is a
remainder that can only couple efficiently to higher order modes. The result is
more energy, but with more beam divergence and greater pulse width, ore even
multiple pulses.
<p>
Single mode performance can be achieved by using a dye Q-switch. Optical
quality of the system has to be good. Otherwise, you end up with a single mode,
but it may be a poorly shaped one.
<p>
The dye Q-switch does its magic by keeping gain slightly above threshold for a
long time. This gives the lowest order mode a chance to grow at the expense of
higher order modes that have lower gain. Finally, when the dye bleaches, that
mode grows in energy, excluding off-axis modes.
<p>
A similar effect can be achieved using electro-optical Q-switches. Use a two
step process where the first step gets you barely above threshold thereby
selecting the highest gain mode. The second step reduces resonator losses to
where the selected mode seeds the laser to produce a high energy lowest
order mode.

<h3><A NAME="strief">Inconsistent Energy from Forth Harmonic Pulses</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
How much variation is there?
<p>
Please keep in mind that you are going through two nonlinear processes to
get to the 4th harmonic. it is the least efficient process of the the other
nonlinear processes, and any instability in pulse to pulse power/energy is
magnified by the time you get to the 4th harmonic.
<p>
The easy way to tell if this is the case would be to have a dual channel
oscilloscope look at the fundamental and the 4th harmonic.  If you notice
dips in the fundamental at the same time as the dips in the harmonic, then
that's the problem.  If you are seeing very large fluctuations only in the 4th
harmonic in this case, it's probably due to improper phase matching. Try
adjusting the angle of the crystal (quadrupler) or the temperature.

<h3><A NAME="strclpi">Comments on Nd:YAG Laser Power Instability</A></h3>

The following discussion was prompted by the question below on the USENET
newsgroup alt.lasers:
<p>
<blockquote>
"There is a 15% power instability when the laser is working CW, single
 transverse mode and polarized.  The crystal is new, and so are the mirrors
 and polarizer plate.  The power level is OK (13 Watts) but stability is
 terrible.  This is so even without the Q-switch and mode-locker
 acousto-optics modulators in the cavity."
<p>
 I measured the optical power variation of the pump lamp.  Its instability is
 well below 1%, with frequency components of 60 Hz and harmonics, as expected.
 It is a new EG&G lamp, clean, and properly installed with correct
 polarization.  The problem is not there."
</blockquote>
<p>
(From: David Demmer (ddemmer@physics.utoronto.ca).)
<p>
My best advice: lasers are simple machines so don't panic, approach it
systematically and it will work. Finicky: simple and finicky.
<p>
There's only going to be three sources of instability: electronic, optical,
and mechanical.  Rule out the easy ones - get your 
electronics shop to have a look at the current to the lamps. If it is steady
and the lamp is not in backwards you are OK. If the optical and other 
mounts are steady, you are OK - they almost certainly are, even if they
have crummy adjustments they won't go anywhere unless the system
is vibrating.
<p>
Optical problems. These usually arise in YAG because it has strong thermal
lensing and there are always small fluctuations in the cooling water
flow. The trick is make sure that the flow is as laminar as possible
and that the intracavity beam is centered in the rod and not too large.
<p>
Check the flow tubes around the lamp and/or rod: Are they in good 
condition? no cracks? held firmly in place? Cracks are hard to see when
the tubes are wet. 
<p>
Are the ends of the rod clean? Sometimes leaks around
the rod end seals cause mineral deposits on the faces. This is 
very tough to check properly without disassembling the lamp/rod housing,
but here is a quick-and-dirty.
<p>
With the lamps off (!!!) shine a flashlight through the rod while looking 
through it along the laser axis using a small dental mirror. It should look
PERFECT, absolutely NO indication that there is something there. ANY flaw,
haze, or whatever which is visible under these conditions will kill you.
<p>
Is the rod aligned? Make small (1 to 2 mm aperture) alignment apertures
that you can place on the cavity mirrors, and align the laser so that
the beam is centered on them. Make similar, though smaller (0.5 to 1 mm)
apertures that you can place on the "pot", i.e. the assembly that holds 
the rod. You must make absolutely sure that the beam is centered on the 
laser rod. The laser may stop lasing with these in place: this would be 
a good sign, since it should not if the rod really is centered.
<p>
If necessary you will need to do a HeNe alignment of the whole works: 
mirrors and rod. Don't be afraid to move the pot around to align the 
laser: it is the only way, and with a HeNe you can always recover from 
any alignment disaster.
<p>
If the beam really is centered and there are still problems, try restricting
the size of the intracavity beam: it may be "trying" to go multimode and
need a bit of help to keep it TEM00. You may need to reduce the power
by 20 or 30% to get it stable, but use the largest you can. Also, if the 
lamps are driving too hard the thermal lens may be just too strong and
the cavity may be getting close to an unstable resonator configuration.
Try backing off the lamp current. I know of one laser (Coherent 
Antares) that will actually stop lasing with too much lamp current.
<p>
Above all, there is no point in putting in the mode locker etc. until the
laser works really well as an unpolarized cw laser.
<p>
(From: Roland A. Smith (see@www.lsr.ph.ic.ac.uk).)
<p>
We found cooling water fluctuations to have BIG effect on the system.
It originally had the mode locker cooled from the flashlamp supply
(ugly) and running a separate small cooler on the mode locker helped
quite a lot.  In addition we added our own control electronics to the
existing temp control.  We actually stuck a central heating system
heater in the main water bath coupled to a programmable differential
controller.  This adds heat as necessary to keep things more stable.  Do
you hear the cooling water controller go "thump .... clunk woosh....
wait .... repeat.  If so you're going to have problems. 
<p>
The water circulation to the mode locker is currently removed.  We do have
this "thump .... clunk woosh...." system.  (Very nice sound effect :) ) 
However, by changing the secondary water pressure I can have it run almost
continuously (only woosh).  There doesn't seem to be a correlation between
the CW Nd:YAG noise (1 kHz range) and the water temperature control system.=
<p>
These systems can be a real bitch.  Ours now provides useful service as a door
stop. :)  Believe NOTHING they tell you.
<p>
(From: Mattias Pierrou (mp@optics.kth.se).)
<p>
Since your laser components are all new, I suggest that you take a look at
the flashlamp and/or your power supply. Some time ago we had stability
problems with one of our high power lasers (different kind though - Ar+)
and we tracked it down to the old, worn power supply.
<p>
(From: Ralph Page (Ralph.Page@Prodigy.net).)
<p>
Reading these comments brings back some pretty horrifying experiences from my
past.  I am not sure I saw the original post but all of the suggestions you
noted were consistent with my thoughts.  I am really suspicious of the water
flow within the pump chamber.  Is it possible for you to alter the flow
rate/pressure of your cooling source?  If you have an alternate to the
existing water source or you can alter it simply (flow rate pressure, etc.)
you may get a hint about minimizing the instability.

<h2>Repair of DPSS Laser Pointers</h2>

The following applies to laser pointers based on Diode Pumped Solid State
(DPSS) laser technology.  The most common by far is the green variety.
However, a few very expensive blue DPSS laser pointers do exist.  For common
red pointers, see the section: <A HREF="laserdio.htm#diordlp">Repair of Diode
Laser Pointers</A>.   And, for older style helium-neon laser based laser
pointers, see the chapter: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrtoc">HeNe Laser Testing,
Adjustment, Repair</A>.
<p>
With prices as low as $1.00, serious troubleshooting and repair of a cheap red
laser pointer probably isn't worth the effort, time, and expense.  However,
with the average price of a green DPSS laser pointer still over $150, there
could be significant motivation if the warranty has run out, is void due to
damage or abuse, or never really existed in the first place. :(  But, if there
is still a useful warranty, I highly recommend that you take advantage of it!
<p>
From the <A HREF="lptrcmp1.gif">Comparison of Red and Green Laser Pointer
Complexity</A>, it is quite obvious that there is a lot more "stuff" inside
a green pointer, though not all models are quite this complex.  However,
even the new generation of green pointers using Multiple Crystal Assemblies
(MCAs) rather than discrete crystals and optics, still have 2 or 3 times the
number of parts and the need for very precise alignment.
<p>
Fortunately, the most common problems are probably still
external to the DPSS laser module itself.  Better hope so - doing anything
inside there is at best a royal pain and probably justified only by its
educational experience or laser parts salvage value.
<p>
The following photos and diagrams apply to the two typical approaches:
<p>
<ul>

 Laser Pointer</A> for a photo of the gross anatomy of one using discrete
 crystals and optics.

 for a photo of the gross anatomy of one using an MCA.
<li><A HREF="glpmca1.gif">Typical Green DPSS Laser Pointer Using MCA</A> for
 a diagram of the construction details.
</ul>
<p>
The detailed disassembly procedure will depend on the exact model.
A combination of screw, press-fit, and glue holding things together
is likely.  Non-destructive disassembly may not be possible for some
components.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strdgp1">Disassembly and Reassembly/Alignment of
the Edmunds L54-101 Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>
for the detailed procedure for the L54-101 model and
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strdgp2">Disassembly and Reassembly/Alignment of an
MCA-Based Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>.  Lower cost models will be more along
the lines of the second type, but may be even more difficult to disassemble
if it's possible at all.  And, as regulatory agencies discover the potential
dangers of boosting the power of green laser pointers, manufacturers may be
required to assure that they can't be disassembled non-destructively!
<p>
Here are the most common adjustments/repairs:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Focus adjustment:</b> Where there is no external focus adjustment, it
 may be possible to remove the front bezel and then access an internal focus
 ring.  With luck, it can be turned with a flat blade screwdriver, unbent
 paper clip, or other suitable tool to tweak for best focus.  Don't force
 anything and take care not to scratch the lens.  If what you see is a blue
 or green IR filter, the lens may be behind it or the entire assembly may be
 adjustable.  However, it may be necessary to remove a bit of glue locking it
 in place.  If the entire lens assembly is glued - no threaded barrel -
 adjustment may not be possible.
<p>
<li><b>Water damage:</b> If the pointer got seriously wet, <b>immediately</b>
 remove the batteries and get as much liquid out as possible.  If the liquid
 was just plain water, waiting long enough for it to completely dry (perhaps
 with modest assistance from a heat gun or blow dryer on the low setting)
 before replacing the batteries may be all it needs if nothing got on the
 inside of the optics or into the DPSS module itself.  However, if the liquid
 was something other than plain water, particularly a corrosive substance like
 salt water, complete disassembly and cleaning will be required - at least to
 the level of the battery compartment, laser diode driver, and DPSS module.
<p>
 If anything actually got inside the DPSS module, or its components are not
 even partially sealed, repair may be hopeless since any contamination will
 likely render it totally inoperable and may result in permanent damage even
 if cleaning can be performed quickly.  In any case, total disassembly of
 all the crystals and optics would be needed.  This will necessitate partial
 or total realignment of the laser diode, crystals, and optics.  In the
 unlikely event that the laser diode is in a hermetically sealed package (not
 many, if any, models do it this way due to cost), a total cleaning using
 proper laser mirror cleaning techniques - followed by realignment - may
 permit the pointer to be salvaged.  However, with most or all units using
 bare laser diodes, any contamination that reaches the laser diode chip may
 be bad news indeed.  In the latter case, very careful cleaning with pure
 alcohol or acetone may save it but this has to be done before attempting
 to power the diode - anything on the facet while powered may be terminal.
 For pointers using composite vanadate/KTP crystals, much less alignment is
 needed but access to parts will still be a challenge.
<p>
<li><b>Dirt of debris inside:</b> This isn't likely unless the pointer
 was disassembled but even a tiny spec of dust on an internal optic or
 a hair in the beam path can result in a really messed up beam.
<p>
<li><b>Physical damage:</b> Where parts are actually broken, replacement may
 be the only option.  Some of the optics in DPSS laser pointers may not be
 standard so at best, some improvisation or substitution could be needed if
 the manufacturer doesn't sell replacements.
</ul>
<p>
Here are possible problem areas for a pointer that is weak or dead and
hasn't been run over by a Sherman Tank:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Battery:</b> Test under load or replace.  Make sure the individual
 cells are correctly oriented - in most cases this is with the positive
 terminals pointing <i>away</i> from the driver, opposite of a flashlight.
 Check for dirty or corroded contacts and clean if necessary.  Since DPSS
 laser pointers have significantly higher current requirements than the red
 variety, battery health is much more critical.  Even if the battery seems
 like it should be healthy, try a fresh one to be sure.  I once had a set of
 fresh AAA Alkaline cells in a green pointer die for no apparent reason.
 I can only guess that the cover of the beautiful oiled polished hand carved
 wood case accidentally pressed the switch causing it to be stuck on.
<p>
 Of course, if not using the pointer for a few days, remove the battery.
 Leakproof batteries have been known to leak!
<p>
<li><b>Switch:</b> Using an ohmmeter, check for reliable operation of the
 push button switch.  The switch is a common failure item due to the higher
 current requirements of these compared to red pointers.  Some manufacturers
 used the same switches for both which resulted in early failure.  Replacement
 switches may be obtained from a service parts supplier (they are often
 similar to those used on VCRs and other consumer electronic equipment).
 However, make sure the replacement switch can handle the current - usually
 between 150 and 500 mA.
<p>
<li><b>Battery continuity through case:</b> The connection from one terminal
 of the battery (usually the positive facing out the back) is likely through
 the metal case to the DPSS laser module and then to the driver board possibly
 via the laser diode can or mount.  Since there are several joints involved
 and most are mechanical (not soldered) bad or intermittent connections are
 likely.  Check for any looseness in the joints and measure resistance with
 a DMM (NOT an analog VOM which might produce too much voltage on the ohms
 ranges that can damage the laser diode) while tapping and wiggling the various
 parts.  If a problem is found, note that the output beam collimation and
 alignment may be affected by any changes to the the module joints.  Don't
 just tighten them without taking care to maintain the original positions.
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode driver:</b> Look for cracked solder connections,
 particularly at the switch and where the laser diode attaches to the
 driver board - these get abused.  If there is a power adjust pot, mark
 its exact location and then turn it back and forth a couple times to
 clean its track.  (Increase the power output setting at your own risk!)
 Test any diodes and transistors for shorts and opens.  If there is an IC
 and it has a part number that can be identified, search out the datasheet.
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode:</b> If the laser diode is inside the sealed DPSS laser
 module, even if you can get to it, total realignment will very
 likely be needed upon reassembly.
 These are moderate power 808 nm laser diodes, probably 150 to 500 mW max.
 See the sections starting with: <A HREF="laserdio.htm#diodct">Determining
 Characteristics and Testing of Laser Diodes</A> to determine if the laser
 diode is still good.  It may be possible to replace a bad laser diode but
 the operating current and emitter width specs would need to match fairly
 closely.  The cost of these diodes in single quantities could easily exceed
 the total replacement cost of the green pointer!
</ul>
<p>
Finally, although the typical green pointer is very well constructed with
remarkably precise machining and the use of generous amounts of adhesive,
they are still susceptible to shock and impact.  And, as the technology
matures and costs come down, corners may be cut as well.
<p>
I was given one unit that was totally dead after falling onto a hard floor
(material not known).  The pump diode was butt-coupled (almost touching with
no relay lens) to what looks like a CASIX DPM0102 composite crystal, which
was secured in place with RTV silicone (essentially bathtub caulk).  What
must have happened is that the inertia of the crystal and mount at the
time of the fall caused the crystal to move ever so slightly,
impacting the diode and breaking it into two pieces, the larger of which
was still attached to the two bonding wires hanging in mid-air.
<p>
If not totally ruined by mechanical shock, alignment may be affected
resulting in decreased output power and degradation in beam quality.
<p>
So, as preventive maintenance, dump the fancy wooden box that so many
of these green laser pointers arrive in and use a well padded case instead.
In addition, it might be wise to fasten a lanyard to the pointer so it can
be attached to a belt and won't fall on the floor when you bend over.
Your pointer will thank you. :)

<h3><A NAME="strdgp1">Disassembly and Reassembly/Alignment of the Edmunds
 L54-101 Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A></h3>

Here is the complete step-by-step procedure for non-destructively
disassembling the <A HREF="http://www.edsci.com/">Edmund Scientific</A>
L54-101 green DPSS laser pointer.  The reassembly/alignment procedure
then follows.  These should also apply, with minor
modifications, to several other models that use the same DPSS module
using discrete optics (not an MCA).  Compare this to the simplicity of a
<A HREF="lsrptr1.gif">Typical Red Laser Pointer</A>!)  For a description
of this unit, see the section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#ssleslp">The Edmund
Scientific Model L54-101 Green Laser Pointer</A>.  (Other green pointers
such as the one shown in <A HREF="grnptr1.jpg">Components of Typical Green
DPSS Laser Pointer</A> will possibly require a very different procedure.
See the next section.)
<p>
The construction details are shown in <A HREF="l54-101.gif">Edmund Scientific
L54-101 Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A>.  This should help make sense of the
procedure below.
<p>
The L54-101 uses the same DPSS module as the unit disassembled somewhat
destructively in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment
Gallery</A> (Version 1.74 or higher) under "Dissection of Green Laser
Pointer" and probably many other models. See <A HREF="grnorg1.jpg">Internal
Organs of Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A> for an annotated photo of the major
components.
<p>
Here is a detailed procedure that should provide access to everything inside
with at least the possibility of reassembly, though putting everything back
together with any chance of getting back to a working state with good beam
quality will require quite a bit of care, determination, and the prolific use
of selected four letter words (see below). :) It would probably be a good idea
to have the sequence of photos in front of you while embarking on this
adventure.  A warning to the squeamish: some of these pics are a bit gory
and you may want to send any working green pointers you own to another room
for the duration. ;)  The case and laser diode driver of the L54-101 are
different than those shown in the dissection but all the actual DPSS laser
parts are absolutely identical.
<p>
The first set of steps deals with basic disassembly of the case:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unscrew the battery retainer cap and remove the lithium cell.
<p>
<li>Gently, bend and twist the two chrome sections back and forth at the
 gold plated ring until the longer section enclosing the battery compartment
 and laser diode driver can be removed.  Don't lose the rubber push button
 pusher.
<p>
<li>Wrap a fine wire around the two terminals of the laser diode (to protect
 against ESD, etc.) and unsolder the driver board.  Then solder a jumper
 across the two terminals.  Make a note that the driver terminal marked LD+
 goes to the <b>grounded</b> terminal if you ever intend to put this thing
 back together!!!
</ol>
<p>
Note: There is no need to actually remove the driver board if you aren't
going to go inside the cavity itself and will only be dealing with the
front optics but if there is a need to remove the inner brass barrel of
the DPSS module, it's easier without the bulky circuit board in the way.
<p>
The next set of steps deals with removing the "rear cavity" components
including the pump laser diode, vanadate (Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, and KTP:
<p>
<ol start=4>
<li>Make some scribe marks on the inner brass barrel or use some other
 means so you will know the <i>exact</i> orientation of the copper disk/LD
 terminals.  This is critical in achieving proper alignment if all you do is
 remove and replace the rear cavity components and expect the pointer to have
 any chance of working properly without a lot of risky fiddling.  The reason
 is that since as a result of normal manufacturing tolerances, the pump diode
 isn't perfectly centered and the vanadate isn't perfectly perpendicular to
 the optical axis, the original orientation must restored to match up with
 the alignment of the OC Mirror, Expanding Lens, and Collimating lens.  Even
 then, a bit of lateral jiggling will be needed. :)
<p>
<li>Using a pointed tool (Xacto knife, dental pick, tiny screwdriver, etc.),
 scrape all the visible dabs of adhesive from the joint between the aluminum
 retaining ring and the brass barrel, and between the ring and the copper
 plate (which is the back of the laser diode mount).
<p>
<li>Firmly grasp the case in one hand and with a suitable retaining ring
 adjustment tool, attempt to turn the retaining ring counter-clockwise <b>just
 the smallest amount</b>.  (My custom retaining ring adjustment tool is a
 piece of thin sheet steel with a pair of projections filed to fit the
 slots in the ring with a cutout to clear the LD terminal posts.  Other
 possible "tools" for this and the other retaining rings include reworked
 oversize paper clips and hose clamps.)  It is best if the copper plate
 <b>not</b> rotate with the ring.  Thus, as soon as the ring can be turned,
 attempt to break it free of the plate and prevent the plate from rotating
 as you unscrew the ring all the way.  As the ring is removed (don't lose
 it!), keep the case upright as this will expose a few loose parts.
<p>
<li>The copper plate on which the laser diode is mounted can now be pulled
 free.  If the diode is still good, store this assembly in an antistatic bag.
<p>
<li>With a soft lint-free cloth or preferably, some lens tissue, turn the
 case over.  The following parts should fall out one by one.  Make a note
 of the orientation (top/bottom) of the vanadate and KTP assemblies:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Aluminum spacer ring.
 <li>Copper plate with the 2 x 3 x 0.5 mm vanadate crystal.
 <li>Three-quarter round brass disk with 2 x 2 x 3 mm KTP crystal.
 <li>Indexing pin.
 </ul>
<p>
 Note that the indexing pin goes through the hole in the vanadate plate that's
 closer to the outer edge and into the center of the three holes in the KTP
 plate.  The outer end of the indexing pin also fits into the laser diode
 mounting plate so all three components remain more or less aligned (though
 there is a lot of slop).
</ol>
<p>
At this point, if the problem (if any) was with the rear cavity components
(and not the OC mirror), then there is no need to go further and reassembly
may be possible without complete realignment - but probably only if all you do
is look at the parts!  Any replacement or even just regluing of vanadate, for
example, will almost certainly result in a large enough change that this won't
be possible.
<p>
The next set of steps deals with removing the OC mirror and front optics:
<p>
<ol start=9>
<li>Unscrew the front gold plated bezel.
<p>
<li>It is best to remove the inner brass barrel at this point.  This is done
 using a press (e.g., a drill press but not for drilling) and suitable scrap
 wood or aluminum.  Force needs to be applied between the very outer brass
 casing (there should be two visible - one is part of the casing and can
 stay in place) at the cavity end and the inner aluminum cylinder (the one
 with the collimating lens glued to it) at the output end.  It shouldn't
 require very much force and the entire assembly will slide out.  Take care
 that no force is applied to the collimating lens.
<p>
<li>Unscrew the long aluminum cylinder holding the collimating lens revealing
 the green IR filter.  If desired, scrape off the bits of glue and remove the
 disk on which the lens is glued.
<p>
<li>Similarly, unscrew the aluminum assembly which contains the IR filter and
 expanding lens.
<p>
<li>Using a large flat blade screwdriver, remove the retaining ring securing
 the OC mirror.  Take care not to scratch the mirror!
<p>
<li>Finally, use a tiny flat blade screwdriver to slightly loosen the set
 screws holding the OC mirror and remove it.
</ol>
<p>
That's everything!  Admire your pile of green laser pointer parts. :)
<p>
CAUTION: If both the rear cavity components and OC Mirror are moved, a
complete realignment will probably be required as described below.  However,
if only the rear cavity components or the OC Mirror are moved (but not both),
then only they would need to be realigned.
<p>
The procedure for reassembly (or original assembly at the factory) and
alignment would be something along the lines of the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Install KTP, Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, spacer ring, indexing pin, and Pump Laser
 Diode assembly.  Tighten the retaining ring securely.  Some dabs of Epoxy
 at strategic locations would probably be advisable to prevent any movement
 due to stress from the driver board connections.
<p>
<li>Solder temporary wires to the pins of the laser diode and attach them to
 the correct terminals of the driver PCB.  Double check your connections!
 Arrange to power the driver PCB using a 3 V battery or regulated DC power
 supply.
<p>
<li>Install the OC Mirror and its retaining ring loosely.
<p>
<li>Power the Laser Diode and adjust OC Mirror radial position until cleanest
 and strongest TEM00 beam is obtained.  Carefully tighten the 3 set-screws
 (only 1 is shown) and retaining ring to lock OC in position.  This may need
 to be done in small steps to maintain optimal beam quality.  Since this is
 not exactly precision machining, go slow and assume each adjustment affects
 everything else!
<p>
<li>Install Expanding Lens/IR Filter mount.  Adjust lens position to center
 output beam and add dabs of glue to lock it in place.  The mount may press
 on the OC mirror retaining ring so some tweaking of OC position may be
 requireed after this step.
<p>
<li>Install Collimating Lens mount.  Adjust Collimating Lens radial position
 to center output beam.  Add dabs of glue to lock it in place.
<p>
<li>Adjust Collimating Lens axial position for desired focus in far field and
 add dabs of glue to lock it in place.
<p>
<li>Remove the temporary wires and solder the driver PCB to the laser diode
 pins.  Double check connections and position to permit the DPSS module and
 driver PCB to slide into the case without binding.
<p>
<li>Install the power button in its hole in the case.  Securing it loosely with
 a strip of thin tape inside the case will prevent it from falling out even if
 the pointer is disassembled multiple times.  Install completed DPSS module
 in laser pointer body.
</ol>
<p>
Since it is unlikely I can find a replacement pump diode unless from a similar
pointer that died for some other reason, I put everything back
together, aligned the DPSS module for maximum output (what of it there is!)
and a clean TEM00 beam, but didn't touch the alignment of the output optics,
which appeared to be close enough.  So now I have perhaps the World's weakest
green DPSS laser pointer producing about 0.2 mW on a good day.  Not knowing
the ratings of the pump diode, I don't dare increase the current beyond the
400 mA peak produced by the driver at the original setting of the pot (about
200 mA average current at the 50 percent duty cycle).  Even at 0.25 mW, the
pointer is quite usable since 0.25 mW of 532 nm green has about the same
brightness as 2 mW at the typical 650 nm red pointer wavelength.  And, it's
guaranteed eye-safe. :)

<h3><A NAME="strdgp2">Disassembly and Reassembly/Alignment of an MCA-Based
 Green DPSS Laser Pointer</A></h3>

Here is the complete step-by-step procedure for non-destructively
disassembling the typical green laser pointer using a Multiple Crystal
Assembly (MCA) in its DPSS module.  These types of pointers are described
in the section: <A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslailp">Anatomy of an Inexpensive
Green Laser Pointer</A>.  The reassembly/alignment procedure then follows.
These should also apply, with minor
modifications, to several other models that use an MCA in the DPSS module
(not discrete optics).
<p>
A detailed diagram of the internal construction of a typical MCA-based
pointer is shown in
<A HREF="glpmca1.gif">Typical Green DPSS Laser Pointer Using MCA</A>.
The procedures below are based on this pointer.
<p>
The first set of steps deals with basic disassembly of the case:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unscrew the battery retainer cap and remove the 2 AAA cells.
<p>
<li>Clamp the front output cap in a vice with some pieces of paper or
 cloth to prevent marring of the chrome finish.  Gently rock the pointer
 back and forth and the guts should come free.  Set the brass/gold plated
 ring and button aside in a safe place.
<p>
<li>Wrap a fine wire around the three terminals of the laser diode (to protect
 against ESD, etc.) and unsolder the driver board.  Then solder a jumper
 across the two terminals.
</ol>
<p>
Note: There is no need to actually detach the driver board if you aren't
going to remove the laser diode but there is less risk of damaging the
diode's leads while working if there is no bulky PCB hanging off of it.
<p>
The next set of steps deals with removing the pump diode:
<p>
<ol start=4>
<li>Carefully scrape away any visible glue securing the pump diode retaining
 ring.
<p>
<li>Use a flat blade screwdriver or similar tool to remove the retaining
 ring, turning counterclockwise.
<p>
<li>Remove the pump diode and immediately install it in an antistatic
 bag taking care not to touch the exposed diode chip or bonding wires.
<p>
 A spacer and the pump focusing lens may come out as well.  There may be an
 orientation (front-to-back) of the focusing lens.  On the pointer in the
 diagram, the aspherical side was facing the diode.
</ol>
<p>
The next set of steps deals with removing the output optics and MCA.
For the following which require unscrewing three pieces, it may be
necessary to use a vice and pliers, or two pairs of pliers to get enough
torque to break the glue bond locking them in place.  As above, use some
soft material to prevent damage to the brass and don't squeeze too hard!
I found that pieces of rubber from a bicycle inner tube worked well as
cushions.
<p>
<ol start=7>
<li>Unscrew the front output cap from the threaded cylinder.  The IR-blocking
 filter will fall out as they come free.  Set it aside.
<p>
<li>Unscrew the threaded cylinder with the collimating lens from the
 expanding lens mount.  The collimating lens is held in place by a pressed-in
 brass ring.  It's probably not wise to attempt to remove it unless it is
 already damaged.
<p>
<li>Unscrew the expanding lens mount from the pump and MCA mount.  The
 expanding lens is in a brass holder, which may be carefully pryed off
 of the mount.  Clean off the glue debris.
<p>
<li>At this point, the output mirror of the MCA is exposed.  First note
 the orientation.  For the CASIX DPM, there is an arrow on one side.
 Upon reassembly, this side should face the same way with respect to the
 pump diode facet (and pins) for maximum pump absorption.  The difference
 in output power if incorrect can be a factor of 10:1 or worse.  (Of course,
 it's also easy to determine this by trial and error - just be aware that
 incorrect orientation might be the cause if you only get 50 microwatts
 out upon reassembly!)  The MCA
 may be removed by carefully scraping away the glue holding it in place with a
 single edge razor or Xacto blade  Take care as it is quite fragile,
 especially the mirror surfaces.  Make sure it can't drop on the floor or
 go pling off to a location never to be found again!
<p>
 CAUTION: The mirror coatings on the MCA are very fragile and will peel off
 if given the slightest excuse.  It is really best to leave the MCA in its
 holder with the expanding lens mount screwed in place.
<p>
 <li>Remove the MCA mount by scraping away the glue around the edge.
</ol>
<p>
At this point you have a box of green pointer parts. :)  However, if the
disassembly operation was done with reasonable care, it should be possible
to restore the patient to perfect health.  A new diode (5.6 mm can with
cover would work) or replacement MCA can be installed if needed.  Here is
the procedure for reassembly and alignment - confirmed to work.  A means
of powering the pointer guts outside the case will be needed.  This can be
a battery holder for the 2 AAA cells or a regulated 3 V power supply.
<p>
WARNING: Without the IR-blocking filter in place, there can be enough IR
leakage at both 808 nm and 1,064 nm to be a vision hazard.  This is
most significant for the 1,064 nm which is both invisible and collimated
like the 532 nm green.  The use of proper laser safety goggles is highly
recommended especially for those procedures like the expanding lens
alignment requiring the beam to be pointing vertically and where it's
direction can change suddenly while adjusting the lens position.
<p>
<b>Pump diode installation:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Install the pump focusing lens and spacer ring (if removed), and pump
 diode into the pump focusing lens housing.  Thread in the retaining ring
 and tighten securely.  Put a dab of 5 minute Epoxy or UV cure adhesive
 on the ring and body to secure it.
<p>
 Note that while the original pump diode may have been a 5.6 mm type without
 a cover, it should be possible to use a commercial 150 to 500 mW 5.6 mm can
 diode with a cover in its place.
 <A HREF="http://www.roithner-laser.com/">Roithner</A> has one that might
 be suitable.
<p>
<li>Position the driver PCB and solder it to the pump diode.  Note that
 to fit in the case, the PCB may actually mount a mm or so offset from the
 centerline and the diode leads will have to be positioned accordingly
 BEFORE soldering.  Set the pot on the driver PCB to about half way if
 unsure of where it was.
<p>
<li>Temporarily attach a fine wire after the pushbutton switch so power can
 be applied without having to hold the button in while testing.  Or, figure
 out a way to hold the button in. :)  The negative lead of your power source
 goes to switch.  The positive lead goes to the brass cylinder in which the
 pump diode is mounted.
</ol>
<p>
There are now two possible procedures for aligning the MCA with respect to
the pump diode and optical axis.  The first doesn't require fancy equipment
but may not result in best performance.  It may also result in maximum
frustration.  The second requires a 5-axis micropositioner (X, Y, Z, yaw,
pitch) with some sort of gripper to hold the MCA mount but should result
in maximum power and nearly perfect beam pointing direction.  A laser power
is desirable when peaking output power.  (It can just be a photodiode and
multimeter on its mA range.)
<p>
<b>Basic MCA alignment procedure:</b>
<p>
<ol start=4>
<li>Use small dabs of adhesive to attach the MCA mount to the pump diode
 module.  The MCA mount should be centered and the bottom of the slot
 should be aligned with the facet of the pump diode, or more easily, the
 PCB should be fairly close.  This may be temporary so don't use gobs of glue.
<p>
<li>Gently clamp the pump diode and pump focusing lens module horizontally
 in a vice so the MCA can be positioned without glue.
<p>
<li>Very carefully, place the MCA in its slot in the MCA mount with the
 vanadate (the blue tinted crystal) toward the pump focusing lens.  For the
 CASIX DPM, the side with the tiny arrow should be toward the edge of the
 driver PCB.   If unsure, you will have to try both possibilities and pick
 the one that produces the most green light.
<p>
<li>Power up the driver.  Unless the MCA is within about 0.2 mm of the
 correct distance from the pump focusing lens, there may be no green output.
 Use a toothpick or other soft fine pointed tool to gently push it back an
 forth to find the location of maximum green light.  This step is the most
 critical in maximizing output power.  A laser power meter might be useful
 but not essential.
<p>
<li>Check the direction of the beam.  It doesn't need to be perfectly aligned
 with the optical axis but should be close since this will affect the alignment
 of the output beam with respect to the pointer body.  If it isn't make sure
 the surfaces of the MCA and the slot are clean and that the MCA is against
 one side of the slot.  There really isn't any easy way to adjust it using
 this simplified procedure in any case except by poking at it as the glue
 cures.
<p>
<li>If possible, adjust the diode current for the desired output power
 to confirm that there are no instabilities.  Sometimes, the best MCA
 location will depend on the operating conditions.  Try the MCA on either
 side of the optimal point determined above to confirm that it is still
 best.  Turn power off for a few minutes and back on to see how it behaves
 from a cold start.  With no temperature control, there may be wild power
 fluctuations when cold that aren't present after warmup or vice-versa.
<p>
<li>Use a tiny bit of adhesive near the middle of the MCA to secure it.  To
 keep the MCA from shifting position, a sliver of wood or something similar
 can be gently wedged in between the MCA and one side of the slot.  Or, use
 something to hold the MCA in place since it will try to stick to whatever
 is used to apply the glue.  Readjust for maximum power while the glue cures.
 On the pointer in the diagram, about 0.5 mm of the MCA poked out from the
 mount (output side).
<p>
<li>Check the location of the beam spot on the output face of the MCA.
 It doesn't need to be perfectly centered but shouldn't be too close to
 any edge.  If the spot is in the central 2/3rds of the surface, it may
 be best to leave it alone and just add some additional glue to secure
 the MCA mount permamently.  However, if it's hugging an edge or corner,
 you'll have to break the MCA mount free of its dabs of glue and reposition
 it to center the beam spot.  Also, these MCAs often have a preferred
 "sweet spot".  Adjusting the MCA mount may identify a better spot
 location.  It will probably be necessary to orient the pump diode mount facing
 vertically so that the MCA mount can be positioned without it falling
 on the floor.  Then add enough glue to secure the MCA mount permanently.
</ol>
<p>
<b>MCA alignment procedure using micropositioner:</b>
<p>
<ol start=4>
<li>Very carefully, place the MCA in its slot in the MCA mount with the
 vanadate (the blue tinted crystal) toward the pump focusing lens.  For
 the CASIX DPM, the side with the tiny arrow should be toward the edge
 of the driver PCB.  If unsure, you will have to try both possibilities
 and pick the one that produces the most green light.
<p>
<li>Position the MCA so the pump-side surface of the vanadate is almost flush
 with the MCA mount.  For the pointer on which this procedure is based,
 this should allow enough adjustment range in both axial position and
 orientation.  However, it may differ depending on model.  Use the tiniest
 dab of adhesive near the center of the MCA to secure it.  To keep it from
 shifting position, a sliver of wood or something similar can be gently
 wedged in between the MCA and one side of the slot.
<p>
<li>Place the MCA mount in the gripper of your micropositioner set up to be
 almost flush and parallel with the pump diode cylinder.
<p>
<li>Power up the driver.  Unless the MCA is within about 0.2 mm of the
 correct distance from the pump focusing lens, there may be no green output.
 Adjust the micropositioner for at least some green light.
<p>
<li>Adjust the orientation (yaw and pitch) so the beam is aligned with the
 optical axis of the pointer.
<p>
<li>Adjust the position in X, Y, and Z for highest power and best stability
 with the beam spot well away from any edge of the MCA.  Center it if the
 power doesn't change very much based on position.  Take your time.  If
 you rush at this point, you'll never sleep again worrying
 whether the best job was done. :)
<p>
<li>If possible, adjust the diode current for the desired output power
 to confirm that there are no instabilities.  Sometimes, the best MCA
 location will depend on the operating conditions.  Try the MCA on either
 side of the optimal point determined above to confirm that it is still
 best.  In addition, these MCAs often have a preferred "sweet spot".
 Adjusting the position in X and Y as well as Z may identify an even
 better set of coordinates.  Turn power off for a few minutes and back
 on to see how it behaves from a cold start.  With no temperature control,
 there may be wild power fluctuations when cold that aren't present after
 warmup or vice-versa.
<p>
<li>Use 3 dabs of adhesive to secure the MCA mount to the pump diode cylinder.
 Place the adhesive at the 2, 6, 10 oclock positions to avoid dripping any
 inside.  Confirm that the output power doesn't decline as the glue sets and
 fine tune if needed.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Output optics installation and alignment:</b>
<p>
<ol start=12>
<li>Power down and reorient the entire assembly to vertical so the expanding
 lens can be placed in position and adjusted.  Install the expanding lens
 mount securely.  (Fixing it with glue isn't needed at this point but may be
 desirable once everything works.)  Note that it isn't symmetrical - the deep
 threaded side goes toward the pump.  Apply power.
<p>
<li>Check the centering of the beam with respect to the crystal output
 mirror.  It doesn't need to be perfect but should be at least 0.2 mm
 from the sides.  If it is way off center, break the glue bond, center
 it, and add glue to hold it in place.  If it is acceptably well centered,
 add some glue if needed to fix it permanently.
<p>
<li>Put the expanding lens (in its holder) on the mount above the hole and
 use a toothpick to push it around until the beam shoots perfectly vertical
 aligned with the optical axis.  Apply three dabs of adhesive and confirm that
 the alignment hasn't changed before the adhesive cures or is cured.  Readjust
 as needed.  Temporarily screw in the threaded cylinder with the collimating
 lens to make sure the beam goes through the center of the lens.  Adjust the
 expanding position as needed.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Final assembly:</b>
<p>
<ol start=15>
<li>Install the collimating lens cylinder, IR-blocking filter, and output
 cap.
<p>
<li>Install the power button in its hole in the case.  Securing it loosely with
 a strip of thin tape inside the case will prevent it from falling out even if
 the pointer is disassembled multiple times.
<p>
<li>Remove the temporary wires (if used).  Align the switch with the power
 button and then carefully slide the laser assembly into the case.  Install
 the AAA cells and rear end-cap and enjoy!
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="strrgp">Partially Reviving an Inexpensive Green DPSS Laser
 Pointer</A></h3>

I have now more or less completely rebuilt an inexpensive MCA based
green laser pointer.  While, the time and effort involved were an order
of magnitude more than it could ever be worth, the entire exercise
demonstrates that so far at least, this type is built in such a way that
it can be repaired.
<p>
I was given a very dead green laser pointer to analysis, autopsy, or anything
else I pleased.  It is described in the section:
<A HREF="laserssl.htm#sslailp">Anatomy of an Inexpensive Green Laser
Pointer</A>.  A detailed diagram of the internal construction of a typical
MCA-based pointer is shown in <A HREF="glpmca1.gif">Typical Green DPSS Laser
Pointer Using MCA</A>.  I used the basic procedure I developed for this type
of pointer (see the previous section) to nearly completely disassemble and
reassemble it.  However, there was a very significant complication in that
the pump diode was severely mangled and was definitely beyond life support.
<p>
The original owner had decided that the beam shape wasn't perfect or fuzzy
or something (you'll see why shortly) and the beam was erratic so he removed
the driver PCB and DPSS module from the case for inspection and cleaning
of the switch.  Being unable to find any obvious cause of the poor beam
shape, he attempted to reassemble the pointer but the driver PCB caught on
the power button or something along these lines causing one of the
feed-through leads of the naked 5.6 mm can pump diode to be yanked
loose.  A similar diode is shown in <A HREF="ldwnc1.jpg">Laser Diode With
No Cover</A>.  The post to which the feedthrough lead was attached
(the far one in the photo) ripped the bonding wires from the
top of the laser diode chip resulting in a certifiably dead laser diode.
But this represented an irresistible challenge as the diode appeared
undamaged otherwise.  So, here's what I did:
<p>
The first thing was to stabilize the diode lead so the same thing wouldn't
happen while working on the pointer.  So, I positioned the damaged lead in
approximately the correct position and used slow curing Epoxy to secure
it in place.
<p>
Had the bond wires been ripped from the post rather than the diode chip,
it might have been possible to reattach them to the post either with solder
or silver Epoxy.  Unfortunately they ripped from the top of the chip.  So
on to Plan B.  I installed the diode package in an IC socket along with
another pin which had a single strand of #36 wire soldered to it.  This
was then positioned so it could be soldered to the post with its end just
touching the top of the 0.5x0.5mm laser diode chip.
<p>
At first, I positioned the tip of the wire expecting to use a dab of silver
Epoxy to attach it to the diode chip.  But my first attempt resulted in a
mess and a totally shorted diode.  So, after wiping away the mess and
soaking the diode in acetone, I applied the tiniest amount of silver Epoxy
to the tip of the wire and then pressed it down so the blob of silver Epoxy
just contacted the diode chip.  This appeared to work and the diode lased
at low current so I let it sit overnight.
<p>
Note that in addition to the original trauma, this diode has been dropped
more than once, stepped on, fingered, covered in silver Epoxy and cleaned
off, and still survived at least somewhat.  Some laser diodes are tough. :)
<p>
(For more photos and other approaches to this sort of miracle repair,
see <A HREF="http://www.designerinlight.com/holo/dld.htm">Colin Kaminski's
808 nm Laser Diode Dissection Page</A>.)
<p>
Next day, I soldered some thin hookup wires between the diode and driver so it
could be tested without applying excessive stress to the diode leads, which
despite the Epoxy were still not that sturdy.  Even with the Epoxy securing
them, it's still not the same as the original glass to metal seal!
<p>
For initial testing, the diode was installed loosely with its retaining ring
so it could be positioned for optimal orientation (recall that vanadate is
polarization sensitive).  Applying power, there was immediate green light,
though no where near the power it should have been.  Adjusting orientation
helped some but it was obvious that during manufacture, alignment must have
been done on the output optics only after the diode was secured.  Adjusting
the diode position - just given the tolerances of the machining - resulted
in the beam going all over the place and there was no way of doing this
precisely.  Even if a good setting was found, tightening the retaining ring
messed it up.  But even if accurate positioning was possible, it wouldn't
have helped.  When the brightness was best, the beam was way off to one
side with a bad shape.  This was probably how the pointer was shipped.
Great quality control!  When centered, it was barely visible.
<p>
At least the diode was working so I reinstalled the driver board,
added some additional Epoxy to stabilize it with respect to the diode, and
reinstalled and aligned the output optics.  I had to increase the current
to around 300 mA to get the output to settle down.  At 260 mA, it was
erratic until the DPSS module warmed up, from use or body heat.  The beam
wasn't too bad but the expanding lens had to be way off center to get
the beam through the output aperture, and then it shot off at a 5 degree
or so angle to the pointer.  This was unacceptable!
<p>
Further disassembly - unscrewing and removing the brass cylinder with the
expanding lens - revealed the underlying cause: The MCA had been glued into
its holder at a significant angle so the raw beam was shooting at an angle
rather than parallel to the optical axis.  To compensate for this, the
expanding lens had to be offset so far that the beam became distorted, and
this was probably the cause of the original messed up beam shape.  The MCA
(which appears to be seomthing between a CASIX DPM0101 and DPM0102 (what
might be called a DPM0101.5 if there were such a thing as a standard product)
held in place with some white RTV silicone (bathtub caulk!) so it was easily
pried out.  Reinstalling with some 5 minute Epoxy resulted in a somewhat
better aligned beam, though the power was still very low (maybe 0.2 mW).
So, perhaps the MCA wasn't quite positioned correctly.
<p>
I wasn't yet happy so I totally redid the alignment one more time.  This time
I removed everything after the pump focusing lens including the MCA and
MCA mount.  First, the MCA mount was glued in place aligned with
the pump diode facet so that the crystal could be correctly oriented for
optimum pump absorption.  Then the MCA was carefully placed in the
mount, and with power applied, carefully positioned for maximum green
light while confirming that the beam was reasonably well aligned with
the optical axis.  Then, with the pointer clamped in a vice pointing
up, the mount for the expanding lens was installed and the expanding
lens was pushed around until the beam shot out perfectly straight up,
and glued in place with 5 minute Epoxy.  While the Epoxy was curing,
the collimating lens assembly (essentially, the rest of the pointer)
was screwed in place to confirm that the beam was fairly well centered
in the output aperture.
<p>
While the power is still low but adequate (maybe 1 mW), the beam shape is now
quite good and the output lines up well with the pointer optical axis.
A bit of instability is back but the increased power and better beam
shape makes up for that. :)
<p>
The only major casualty was the IR-blocking filter which got crunched when it
popped out and landed on the floor. :(  If anyone has a spare kicking around,

<h2>Laserscope Doubled YAG Maintenance</h2>

<h3><A NAME="strlsde">Laserscope Description</A></h3>

If you've never seen one of these up close and personal, check out the
<A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A> (Version 1.78 or
higher) under "Laserscope Green YAG Laser Systems" for the inside story.
<p>
(From: Steve J. Quest (Squest@cris.com).)
<p>
The Laserscope is a frequency doubled Nd:YAG - 532 nm (green) quasi-CW at
about 57 <b>watts</b> maximum <i>average</i> power (kick ass power, eh?).  It
is a Q-switched, krypton arc lamp pumped, deionized water cooled system.  Arc
lamp pumping energy is about 4.5 kW average.  It sucks 30 A of 208 V 3-phase.
It uses a KTP doubling crystal.
<p>
My major application is commercial advertising.  "Just follow the
green laser beam in the sky to the XXYY company".  When we take it to cities
that have never had an outdoor laser operate there before, it causes GREAT
excitement!  The collimated static beam is visible literally for hundreds
of miles!  The worlds largest bug zapper, mosquitoes are attracted to the
beam, and are instantly dessicated for at least the first few hundred feet
of beam length I'm aware of, possibly farther.  :)  Very buggy areas it
literally rains dry/dead mosquitoes for a time when it first comes on.
<p>
For $53,000 you too can own a Laserscope.  They've come way down
in price. :)  The lowest you can get one for (non-working, severely in
need of repair) is about $5,000.

<h3><A NAME="strlsse">Laserscope Service Information</A></h3>

<A HREF="http://www.allen.dj/laserscope">Allen Analian's Laserscope 800
Series Information & Parts For Sale! Page</A> has a service manual, error
codes, pinouts, schematics, and more.
<p>
The KTP oven wiring is also below:
<p>
(From: Sonicguru (cgraber@fwi.com).)
<p>
The Laserscope KTP oven pin-out is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Pin 1: Top side TEC (-).
Pin 2: Bottom side TEC (-).
Pin 3: Top side TEC (+).
Pin 4: Bottom side TEC (+).
Pin 5: Common jumpered to pin 2.
Pin 6: Three wire thermister yellow wire.
Pin 7: Three wire thermister red wire + common jumpered to pin 3.
Pin 8: Three wire thermister green wire.
</ul>
<p>
Most Laserscopes are not wired for both TEC operation.  They usually use
only the top TEC and the thermister is on the bottom TEC for temp feedback.
One unit had a TEC get damaged and switched the leads to lower TEC to allow
for continued operation with no apparent issues.  It is still smoking
the skies somewhere in Asia. (-;
<p>
To replace the original controller, use an Oven Industries 5C7-350 driver
and follow their wiring and set-up instructions included.  The  driver was
$80.00 or so last time I ordered any.

<h3><A NAME="strlspc">Laserscope Cleaning and Alignment</A></h3>

(Mostly from: Bob.)   
<p>
There is nothing special to be done during cleaning.  If you are familiar
with laser optics, the standard once over swipe method works fine.  The only
problem is the KTP - the crystal is so small, it's a real pain to clean.
Also, when taking the KTP out, be very careful when putting it back in the
mount as it is very easy to put too much torque on the mounting screws to
damage the crystal.  A rule of thumb: When you see the spring loaded screws
get tight, turn them no more than an addition 1/4 to 1/2 turn, then pick up
the mount, and turn it on it's side over a soft clean surface (optic gloves
are best) and lightly tap the mount to make sure the KTP doesn't move around
(the last thing you want is the KTP to work free of the mount and end up loose
on the base plate - I have seen this happen to a laser before!).
<p>
In all honesty i think an amateur may be better suited to align a
Laserscope than a someone who has been working on argon ion or other
non-SHG lasers for a few years.  Most guys who know lasers, but don't
know Laserscopes, go to tweak everything they can for most green out.
This is DEFINITELY NOT the way you want to do things.  The IR laser
must be adjusted for maximum performance and the doubling crystal must
be adjusted for maximum conversion into the green.  These are two
separate fundamental systems, and need to be treated as such.  There
is, of course, interaction.  But the two objectives must be kept in
mind throughout the entire process.
<p>
To perform a complete alignment from scratch, take out the KTP and Q-switch.
If you have an alignment optic, things will be made much easier on you.  A
typical optic is a 5 to 10% OC.  If you have one, put it in place of the
mirror closest to the Q-switch (hence forth referred to as mirror 'A') and
walk the laser to provides the most output using the adjustments on mirror 'A',
and the other back mirror (mirror 'B').
<p>
At this point, install the Q-switch and turn on its voltage but not the gate
pulse.  This will put the laser in hold off mode. Dip the Q-switch as usual to
get minimum output from the optic after this is done, I'll normally go back
and readjust the mirrors a bit with power (24 V) turned off to the Q-switch,
as some are manufactured with no parallel/perpendicular faces, causing the
beam to distort some.
<p>
Next, you replace the output coupler mirror with the normal flat HR.
It is convenient to have a second power meter for the rest of the alignment.
Leave one power meter behind optic A and place a second one in front of the
green output coupler.  Once the KTP crystal is in place you will not adjust any
optic mount other than the KTP crystal and the 'B' optic. I normally turn back
the angle alignment screws on the KTP most of the way, then use my hand to
physically move the mount till I see a flash of strong green light (at about
28 amps of lamp current, and NO Q-switch), then use my other hand to drive
the screws in till the mount stays stable.  At this point you should double
check the beam's position on the KTP by looking in the small orange filter
glass on the mount, center the beam as necessary. The alignment procedure is
similar to walking in an laser, a movement you make on the 'B' optic will
require a complementary move on the KTP angle adjustment mount.  Before you
adjust the 'B' optic, adjust the KTP as you have just put it in the laser for
max green out of the green OC adjust one axis of the 'B' mirror mount for max
IR from the power meter behind mirror 'A'.  Go back and make a complimentary
move on the KTP looking for max green from the green OC.  Repeat till no more
gains can be made in green power, then move to the second axis.  Repeat this
overall process two or three times.
<p>
if you would like to REALLY tune in the laser, it is permissible to make
small adjustments to the 'A' mirror after this initial alignment is
complete, but in no case should you turn the optic adjustment more than
about 1/4 turn (on the 'A' mount) - otherwise you may hit the side of the
KTP, causing thermal fracture.
<p>
Keep in mind that when ever you move a cavity optic you are always looking
for gains in IR, when you adjust the KTP you look for gains in the green
output.
<p>
Next step would be determining the fold back point, in Z-folds this may be
as high as 40 something amps, keep in mind than you can go this high, but it
will obviously decrease the life time of the lamps, and optics (not
catastrophicly, but none the less, a reduction in life will be seen) the
power supply on these lasers is capable of 6 kW continuous, as long as this
is not exceeded (and it shouldn't be) you should not have any problems.
Normally, after maxing out the current, I'll go back and do a quick
realignment.
<p>
The only other adjustment that are left at this point are the crystal
temperature and Q-switch.  Use a multimeter to monitor the crystal temperature
(the test points read in ohms).  It should be around 700 to 800 ohms, but I
have seen some lasers that are hundreds of ohms off.  Turn the trim pot on
the crystal temperature controller in small increments while monitoring the
power.
<p>
At this point it is safe to turn the Q-switch on: Apply 24 volts, and enable
the gate pulse generator.  on the systems with the external gate pulse
generator, RA3 controls the RF power, this may need to be adjusted up
slightly if the laser is putting out a lot more power than it did originally,
RA2 controls the repetition rate.  With doubled YAGs (or any other Q-switched
laser) there is a definite sweet spot where maximum average power will be
reached at a certain Q-switch repetition rate.  This is normally arounds 20 to
25 kHz.  However most laser light show guys turn this pot all the way up to
get maximum repetition rate, so that the beam looks that much more
continuous when scanned at high speeds.  This will cause a reduction of no
more than about 10% of average power.

<h3><A NAME="strclgu">Conversion of Medical Laserscope to General Use</A></h3>

With its former life likely spent in a hospital, the Laserscope will usually
have "features" that simply get in the way of useful work. :)
<p>
(From: Kevin Criqui (usenet@kce.com).)
<p>
I've been collecting information about what is required to modify a 
Laserscope KTP/532 for show use.  What I have so far is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the isolation transformer.
<p>
<li>Remove the original computer board and CRT/front panel.
<p>
<li>Remove and bypass the big contactor that switches power to the pump,
 ALE power supply, etc.
<p>
<li>Remove the unnecessary optics (HeNe laser, polarizer/attenuator, most 
 rotary solenoids).
<p>
<li>Replace the heater driver for the KTP oven.  See the section below.
 What should the KTP temperature be set to?  I assume it would be a good
 idea not to run the lamp before the KTP is at temperature?
<p>
<li>Build a control panel for the ALE power supply.
<p>
<li>Hot-wire the Q-switch driver.  I have the information but haven't yet 
 tested this.  Is there a way to change the Q-switch rate or is it just 
 running or not?
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="strlsmc">Medical Conversion Laserscope Adjustments</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
All Z-folds are capable of putting out far more than what they are rated
for.  They should put out at least 30 W, and a decent one should do around
40 W.  I have personally seen one that was really smoke'n - doing 55 or
56 W.
<p>
These lasers are adjusted for medical use so that their output is just enough
to achieve rated power, although all of the components are capable of much
more.  Basically, all you do is turn the current up on the lamp until you
don't notice any significant increase in optical power (you need a power
meter for this, you can't do it visually). this is called the fold back
point, and it is safe to run your laser at this threshold.  This normally
happens at around 36 to 40 amps for a Z-fold (a few amps lower for an L-fold).
Generally, these lasers are set at 28 to 32 amps at the hospital.  If you use
a multimeter to look at the voltage on the two test points on the lamp power
supply (it unbolts and swings out to you, the test points are normally blue
and red, and on the same side of the supply as the lamps cable, power in and
all that good stuff) if memory serves me correctly 100 mV is 1 A of lamp
current. If your unit is putting out, say, 6 W, it should be doing in the ball
park of 30 W when Q-switched.  And, if your laser came straight from a
hospital and hasn't been adjusted for maximum power, it should do a fair
bit more than that when cranked up...
<p>
The Q-switch module does all the first pulse suppression.  Its control input
only tells the Q-switch driver circuitry to supply gate pulses, and allow the
laser to turn on.
<p>
CAUTION: On the Laserscope or any Q-switched high power YAG (or other SS
laser), don't think you can get away with blanking it (as you might want
to do for laser show applications) by using the gate to the Q-switch.  Some
people have tried and quickly found out that it's the quickest way to destroy
your optics.  If you blank very quickly with your Q-switch, there is no way to
get effective first pulse suppression, and you end up with giant first
pulses drilling all your optics, starting with the most expensive ones. :(
Use other means for blanking like an external galvo.
<p>
The first pulse suppression on the early mods of the Laserscope Q-switch
drivers (the units with the gate pulse circuitry mounted on a board
exterior to the RF section) is kinda iffy.  If you are thinking of using it
for blanking, don't do it very fast (i.e., don't use it for blanking during
a show, but turning the beam on and and off during a show, or for alignment,
etc., is OK).  The newer Q-switch modules have far better first pulse
suppression, and I have been told by the manufacturer that you can blank up
to a few hundred hertz with the Q-switch enable input, but I have not done
this personally in a Laserscope type system.
<p>
There is a heavy transformer in the bottom of the unit which is an isolation
transformer to keep electrical noise from the laser and power supply from
getting into the hospitals electrical system. I have seen many of these fail,
and they are about 140 pounds of dead weight. First thing I normally do after
bypassing the computer on a Laserscope is tearing out that tranny.  It's not
needed unless you plan on doing laser light shows in a hospital surgery. :)
<p>
The schematic for modifying the Laserscope DPSS medical laser to run without
the use of the built in computer can be found on
<A HREF="http://www.skywise711.com/lasers/reference.html">Skywise's
Laser Reference Page</A>.
<p>
(From: Spankey Lee (spankey@eece.unm.edu).)
<blockquote>
"Here is the wiring cheat sheet for the ALE power supply originally drawn
 by some cool guy but redrawn by me so it is easier to read. I built this
 from my drawing and it works except I added a bunch of led's to mine to
 show the states of the switches.  See
 <A HREF="alecp1.gif">Control Panel 1 for Laserscope ALE Power Supply</A>.
</blockquote>
<p>
A WORD OF CAUTION!!!!!!!!!: DO NOT adjust this laser when it is operation.
Major adjustments while the KTP is in the cavity can damage optical
components, even if the Q-switch is off. Adjusting the cavity while the
Q-switch is on is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with your KTP and
optics!!!!! I have seen many a system damaged by such actions, especially
by someone who is new to lasers, or new to frequency doubled YAGs.
<p>
FYI there isn't much reason to look for a manual for this beasts, as they were
all designed for hospital technicians. no real info that is of any use.
The service manual did have some information about changing optics, etc., but
someone with some familiarity of laser shouldn't really need this.  There was
also some info on the working of the recirculator, and other items, but
again, nothing to write home about.  The laserscopes are designed fairly
well, you should basically just be able to 'turn em on' after they have been
in storage for a while.

<h3><A NAME="strlsls">Selecting a Laserscope</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
As a general rule of thumb, L-folds are capable of around 30 W max, maybe a
small bit more if you get a good one.  Z-folds are capable of as much as maybe
65 W, but to be realistic expect 40 W or so max.  Air-cooled units can NOT be
run in all locations continuously (obviously this is dependent on your ambient
temperature - January in upstate NY on an outdoor gig is obviously a much
easier environment to dissipate heat than a rave in an un air-conditioned
warehouse in Florida during August.
<p>
L-folds have about 40% lower divergence than Z-folds.  If you buy an older
unit (before 1988) make sure it has an ALE power supply in it.  (It's quite
obviously marked, and it's at the end of a 10 foot long 1/2" diameter piece
of RG8-U that goes to the head).  If you can't find an ALE, but rather what
looks like an OEM power supply covered with Plexiglas, BEWARE: Those are
ihouse built switchers and they not only fail left and right, but you have
to be able to fix them yourself - they can't be sent out for repair.
<p>
Also you should NOT really pay attention to high power outputs.  There isn't
a lot of difference between 60 W and 24 W in most venus.  There was a time when
I figured 'hell yeah, crank it up till she can't do no more', and as a general
rule of thumb optics do NOT last long when run like that.  A 20 W'er will be
a lot cheaper than a 60 W'er, and a unit run at 'spec' powers will last a lot
longer than one cranking out max power.  That might not mean much if you're
going $50 kilobuck gigs and want as many photons as you can get, but if you
aren't doing big shows, $1,200 for KTP and $600 for a mirror adds up pretty
quick.

<h2>Cooper/Lasersonics YAG Laser Notes</h2>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Cooper has been out of business for years.
<p>
Once you've seen one Lasersonics YAG laser, you've seen them all. If you pop
the top cover you'll find a sticker for who really made the laser head for
Cooper under contract, but most of those companies have been bought
out and died by now.
<p>
The best you can do is pop the side door and find the nameplate on
the 19" rack arc lamp PSU, and try and get a manual from that company,
usually its ALE. Unless for some odd reason you have one made with a
external igniter module not built into the PSU, once you master the
small terminal strip on the side of the PSU you have the laser under
control.
<p>
Here is the typical rundown on an older Trimedine or Cooper YAG laser:
<p>
The YAG rod is kept at optimal temperature without cavity corrosion by a 
deionized (DI) water system flowing through a heat exchanger. The cooling
water flow to the heat exchanger on the hospital side of the loop is
regulated by an on/off solenoid to keep the cavity at about 90 &deg;F
to 95 &deg;F.  It has one arc lamp pumping a very short short extremely
multimode high divergence cavity, usually with a intracavity Risley prism
to ensure mode control. The cavity is not Q-switched and is too short to do
anything useful with except produce unbelievable amounts of highly
dangerous 1,064 nm CW power, often at levels up to double what its
rated for by the manufacturer.  It gets launched into a 300 micron or
larger diameter fiber.
<p>
The lamp current is from 1 A to maybe 35 A at about 165 volts.
<p>
Make sure you buy a pair of OD9 or better goggles designed for surgery
use at 1,064 nm and use them whenever you have this beast energized
watch out for the lamp ignite pulse, its on the order of 35 kV at
couple of amps.  I cannot stress enough how major a eye hazard a yag laser is!
<p>
Keep the DI cooling loop and flow and cover interlocks, they are there
for good reasons, just using tap water will ruin a rod and pump 
cavity faster then you think, often on the order of a few seconds.
<p>
For God's sake if you do not have previous experience with high power
1,064 nm light at these power levels, get some guidance and professional help.
<p>
A big medical service company like Laserlabs or East Coast might be
able to sell you a manual, but expect to pay dearly for it.  Lamps and
some parts might come from Kentek lasers or another similar YAG parts
specialist.

<h2>Aligning the Hughes Ruby Laser</h2>

This applies specifically to the Hughes M-60 ruby laser assembly found on
the surplus market and described in the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclhrl">Hughes Rangefinder Ruby Laser Assembly</A>.
However, the same general methods can be applied to other similar solid
state or other wide bore lasers.
<p>
Here are two approaches assuming that a small HeNe laser (the A-Laser) is
available.  The first one uses the ruby rod exit holes as the initial
alignment axis and then reference everything else to those but requires the
removal of the HR prism and aiming the A-Laser in from each end.  The second
can be done without removing any optics or moving the A-Laser but aligning to
the ruby rod may be more difficult.
<p>
Both require a means of aiming the A-Laser precisely through the RLA optics.
Usually, this would mean bolting or clamping the A-Laser to your lab bench and
mounting the RLA on a three-screw lab jack or something similar so that its
height, side-to-side position, and pitch angle can be adjusted.  A basic
design can be found in the section: <A HREF="laserhtr.htm#htrmir4">Simple
Adjustable Optics Platform</A>.  The distance between the A-Laser and closest
end of the RLA should be no less than 12" so that the alignment of the
reflected spot from the HR/OC can be accurately set.

<h3><A NAME="strhrls">Sam's Method</A></h3>

<ol>
<li>Drill some 1 mm holes in a couple of pieces of opaque cardboard and tape
 them to the ends of the ruby cavity with the holes precisely centered to
 act as a bore sight for aligning the A-Laser to the optical axis of the
 assembly. Prepare another piece of cardboard with a 1 mm hole which is
 taped to the OC mount precisely centered.
<p>
<li>Remove the HR prism reflector.
<p>
<li>Using whatever means you have at your disposal to mount the Ruby Laser
 Assembly (RLA) and A-Laser, aim the A-Laser beam in through the HR
 mount so that its beam passes cleanly through the holes in the bore sight
 (and thus down the axis of the ruby rod) and reflects off the 45 degree
 mirror to the Q-switch prism.
<p>
<li>Rotate/adjust the Q-switch prism so that the A-Laser beam passes through
 the exact center of the OC or its mount.  Adjust the OC alignment so that
 the reflected beam returns along the same path back to the A-Laser's
 aperture.
<p>
<li>Aim the A-Laser in from the OC end so its beam passes cleanly through
 all three pieces of cardboard.  Install the HR prism and adjust it so
 that the reflection returns along exactly the same path to the A-Laser's
 aperture.
</ol>

<h3><A NAME="strhrlw">Wes's Method</A></h3>

The following is based on discussions with Wes Ellison
(<a href="mailto:erl@sunflower.com">erl@sunflower.com</a>).

<ol>
<li>Drill some 1 mm holes in a couple of pieces of opaque cardboard and tape
 them to the ends of the ruby cavity with the holes precisely centered to
 act as a bore sight for aligning the A-Laser to the optical axis of the
 assembly. Prepare another piece of cardboard with a 1 mm hole which is
 taped to the OC mount precisely centered.
<p>
<li>Using whatever means you have at your disposal to mount the Ruby Laser
 Assembly (RLA) and A-Laser, aim the A-Laser beam in through the hole in
 the cardboard on the OC mount so that it reflects off of the Q-switch prism
 and 45" mirror to the bore sight on the ruby rod.
<p>
<li>Rotate/adjust the Q-switch prism, 45 degree mirror, and A-Laser so that
 the A-Laser beam passes through the exact center of at both ends of the
 bore sight to the HR prism.
<p>
<li>Adjust the HR prism so that the beam reflects back to the center of the
 A-Lasers' aperture (ignoring the reflection from the OC).
<p>
<li>Adjust the OC so that its reflection is also centered in the A-Laser's
 aperture.

To set up the Q-switch without powering the flashlamp, proceed as follows:
This requires a high speed photodetector circuit and dual trace oscilloscope.
A suitable circuit would use a silicon photodiode and trans-impedance preamp to
channel A, the pulse from the magnetic pickup to channel B.

<ol start=6>
<li>Install a beamsplitter (e.g., microscope slide at 45 degrees) in the
 HeNe beam so that some of the reflected beam can be diverted to the
 photodetector.
<p>
<li>With the Q-switch motor running at the proper speed, adjust the angular
 orientation of the Q-switch platform/magnetic pickup so that you have the
 desired delay between channels A and B.

<h2>Coherent Compass-M Green DPSS Lasers</h2>

The Coherent Compass-M laser systems consist of a compact laser head, the
"Analog Controller", an optional "Digital Controller", and a DC power
supply.  For information on using these lasers, see the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsm">Coherent Compass-M Green DPSS Lasers</A>.

Should you acquire a C315M (or C215M) without the controller module (which
itself goes for something like $2,000 new, $500 surplus) and want to power it,
here is some info on the wiring as determined during the dissection.

<p>
Note: The C215M laser head is very similar to that of the C315M but lacks the
RES TEC (pins 18 and 19) and the upper LD TEC (pins 12 and 13).
The RES thermistor is also not present but its pin (pin 8) is connected to
the LD thermistor (pin 5) internally.  The P3 pot and associated components
for the RES temperature set-point (pin 7) are also missing on some samples,
though the PCB pads are there.
<p>
Versions of the C315M made after some time in 1997 have what is almost
certainly a digital running time meter consisting of a PIC12C508,
24C021 EEPROM, and (32,768 Hz probably) crystal.  Info on the PIC and
related parts can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.jdm.homepage.dk/newpic.htm">PIC Programmer 2, 16C84,
12C508, etc. Page</A>.  Older versions are functionally identical in other
respects but lack the time meter.  The PIC and EEPROM keep track of how
much time the laser diode is actually driven.  A continuously repeating
serial bit stream with the time code is output via an IR LED when the
laser diode is off.  The present challenge is to decode this 8 to 10
character data!  It doesn't appear to be standard RS232.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315b">Deciphering the C315M Laser Head Serial
Datastream</A>.
<p>
<A HREF="315cct1.pdf">Schematic of C315M Laser Head PCB (Common Wiring)</A>
shows the circuitry associated with laser operation and
<A HREF="315cct2.pdf">Schematic of C315M Digital Running Time Meter</A>
shows the circuitry only present on newer versions of the PCB.  The two
PCBs are shown in <A HREF="315pcb1.jpg">Older Version C315M Laser Head PCB</A>
(Note: PCB in photo is rotated 180 degrees from normal orientation) and
<A HREF="315pcb2.jpg">Newer Version C315M Laser Head PCB</A>.  There may be
minor differences in component values depending on PCB revision.
It wouldn't surprise me if some resistors are select-on-test.  It would be
useful to compare values on a few units.  The letters on the presets seem
mostly fairly obvious but some may be German as Germany is where these are
manufactured:
<p>
<ul>
<li>P1 ILD: Laser diode current limit.
<li>P2 TL: Laser diode temperature set-point.
<li>P3 RES: Resonator (cavity) temperature search center point.
<li>P4 KTP: KTP temperature search center point.
<li>P5 D-KTP: Something to do with KTP TEC search speed.
<li>P6 PD: Optical monitor photodiode set-point for maximum output power.
</ul>
<p>
The wiper on P1 represents the LD current set by the controller with
a calibration of 1 V/A.  But the controller doesn't drive it directly.
Rather, it provides a voltage between 0 and about 4.7 V to pin 1.  As a result
of the resistance network on the head PCB of which P1 is a part, 0 V from the
controller results in some small current to the diode while 4.7 V from the
controller results in the current limit for the diode.
<p>
Note that the settings for P3 and P4 are not the actual values used once
the laser stabilizes but only the <i>center values</i> for the
operating point search routine of the Coherent Analog Controller.  However,
unless they have been changed from their factory settings, the reference
voltage and sensor voltage corresponding to these pot settings will
probably be fairly close once the laser stabilizes.  DO NOT touch the settings
of any pot other than P6 unless you know for sure someone has already
messed with them!!!
<p>
The LD, KTP, and RES temperature sensor pullups are on the PCB.  It is almost
certain that the set-points are where the output voltage of each
temperature sensor with pullup is equal to the output voltage of the
corresponding adjustment.  So, if we know the behavior of the thermistors,
we can predict the correct temperatures for each components.  Even if we
don't, the settings will enable the correct temperatures to be maintained
either manually by comparing the adjustment and sensor output, or with a
closed-loop controller.  Based on experience with the Coherent 532, the
temperature for the sense or set-point will be approximately:
20*(2.5-V)+25 &deg;C.
<p>
Pads U and O - may be "Under" and "Over" for KTP temp - adapting to cases
where the optimal KTP temperature is outside the standard range?

<h3><A NAME="strcpsmp">Troubleshooting Compass-M Laser System Problems</A></h3>

What follows is a general troubleshooting procedure for problems with a
complete C315M laser system consisting of a C315M laser head, Coherent
C315M Analog Controller, control panel or autostart adapter, and DC power
supply.  This procedure is much more complete than what is in the
Coherent Compass 315M user manual.
<p>
It should also be applicable to C215M and C415M systems
(including running the C215M laser head on a C315M controller) subject to the
differences in their DC input power requirements and laser head wiring.  The
user interfaces are the same.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsmc">Differences Between the C215M, C315M, and
C415M</A>.
<p>
It is assumed that a suitable startup sequence is used including
a delay between Power On and Laser On, and pulsing of the Power Set line.
If all you have is a gooped reset widget with a pushbutton, build or
otherwise acquire a proper control panel or autostart adapter.  Though
no damage is likely to result, behavior can be somewhat random and
strange without proper startup sequencing.
<p>
A multimeter and/or monitoring PCBs are desirable to be able to check some
of the voltage levels on the User Interface Connector and laser head, though
most tests can be performed without electronic test equipment.  However, a
laser power meter capable of handling at least 125 percent of the maximum
output of the laser is highly desirable if there is an issue with the
power level and stability.  It should be set for 532 nm if wavelength
sensitive.  As an example, with the Coherent LaserCheck, make sure the
attenuator is in place (1 W range) and hold the wand about 1 foot (0.3 meter)
from the laser output oriented so the small reflection of the beam back to
the laser just misses the output window.  Press the button for several
seconds to get an accurate reading.
<p>
Of course, a complete Compass Diagnostic Unit (CDU) would make
troubleshooting much easier.  The most important things to monitor
would be the TTL status signals on the User Interface Connector,
the laser diode control voltage and current signals on the
laser head, and the laser output power.  The LEDs will instantly identify
any fault conditions and the laser diode signals enable the health of the
laser head to be easily determined.  See the info near
the end of the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsmx">Compass-M Laser
Control Panels</A>.  If all you have to test is a single laser head and
controller, such luxury may be excessive, but if you're testing multiple
lasers, the benefits of a CDU are self evident.
<p>
Here are a list of the common symptoms, more or less in the order in which
they may occur, with possible causes and solutions:
<p>
<b>Initial power up problems:</b> When DC power is applied to the controller,
 it should immediately generate +5 VDC available at pin 11 of the DB15 User
 Interface Connector and pin 25 of the laser head connector (either end of
 the cable).  (For the laser head, pins are numbered starting at the far
 right.)  The interlock (pin 1 of the Interface connector (a relay
 on most C315M and C415M controllers) is normally wired to run off
 of this source but could also use an external source of +5 VDC with
 its return to pin 9 of the Interface connector or pin 23 of the laser head
 connector.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>No power to user interface connector:</b> There should be +5 VDC
 available almost as soon DC input power is turned on.
<p>
 Remove anything attached to the DB15 User Interface Connector and check for +5
 VDC between pin 11 (+5 VDC) and pin 9 (Digital Ground).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If +5 VDC is present, check for a short on the +5 VDC lines of your
  control panel, autostart adapter, or whatever was connected to the DB15.
<p>
 <li>If +5 VDC is not present, check the DC input power.
  The voltage must be between 12 and 28 VDC (for the C315M
  controller) without significant dips at any time.  If the voltage drops
  below 12 V, the laser may shut down.
<p>
 <li>If DC power input is present, inspect and/or test the plug-in fuse next
  to DC power connector.
<p>
 <li>If there is DC input power and the fuse is good but there is no +5 VDC
  with no shorts present, the controller may be defective.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>No interlock click:</b> The interlock relay should engage as soon as
 both DC power is present and the interlock circuit is complete (whichever
 comes last).  This can be heard as a distinct "click" from the controller
 box.  Note: Some very old C315M controllers and all C215M controllers lack
 an interlock relay, in which case there will be no click.  If the laser
 operates normally, then this isn't a problem. :)
<p>
 Check for +5 VDC between pin 1 (Interlock) and pin 9 (Digital Ground)
 of the Interface connector.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the voltage is close to +5 V but no click, the interlock relay
  may be defective or there may be bad solder connections inside the
  controller.  Bad connections are usually straightforward to locate and
  repair.  If the relay is defective, it will have to be replaced, which is
  still doable but considerably more involved.
<p>
 <li>If there is no voltage on pin 1 or it is very low, confirm that there
  is a solid source of 5 VDC (either the controller or an external supply).
  Then check for interlock continuity to pin 11.  The relay requires
  approximately 100 mA at 5 VDC so it cannot be driven by a low current
  logic signal.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Yellow LED on laser head does not come on:</b> This LED should come on
 within a second or so of both Power On (pin 3) and Laser On (pin 2) being
 asserted.  If the sequence of these signals is wrong, the LED may not
 come on and the laser will then not operate.  The proper sequence (or at
 least one that is known to work) is Interlock and Power On (may be
 simultaneous), followed by pulsing Power Set, followed by Laser On.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Confirm that Power On Status (pin 6) and Laser On Status (pin 4)
  on the DB15 are both high.  If the sequencing of Power On and Laser On was
  incorrect, Laser ON Status may not be asserted.
<p>
 <li>Check pin 5 (Laser Diode Overcurrent), pin 7 (Overtemperature), and pin
  12 (Heat Sink Overtemperature).  If any of these are high, the laser won't
  come on or has shut off.  The only thing you have direct control of is
  the temperature of the heatsink, so make sure it is at most slightly warm.
  If pin 7 is high, there is a problem with the pump diode (might be open
  despite the name of the error!), its drive circuit, or wiring.
 </ul>
<p>
  It's conceivable that pin 7 could be high without pin 12 being high and
  correcting any cooling problems will take care of that.  Power cycling
  the laser should then result in correct operation once it has cooled
  sufficiently.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Lasing problems:</b>  There should be green output shortly after the yellow
 LED on the laser head comes on, and then gradually increase to approximately
 50 percent of the selected output power within another 30 seconds to 1 minute.
 Then, power will fluctuate as the controller goes through its seach routine.
 After another 2 or 3 minutes, the power will drop back to a lower level and
 then gradually ramp up to somewhat above the selected power with the
 Ready LED/signal coming on.  Finally, during the next 30 seconds or so,
 the output power is fine tuned and should stabilize at the selected power
 to within 1 or 2 percent.  Ready may flicker a bit before the power fully
 stabilizes.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>No output beam at all:</b> There should be a green output beam within
 typically 10 seconds of the yellow laser head LED coming on, but certainly
 after no more than 30 seconds to 1 minute.
<p>
 No green output at all is usually bad news.  The controller should attempt
 to ramp up pump current until it sees about 50 percent of the specified
 output power or hits the current limit, whichever comes sooner.
<p>
 Look for a green glow *inside* the laser head via the output window.
 (Turn the lights out if necessary.)
<p>
 WARNING: Do this from an oblique angle to prevent the possibility of being
 hit in the eye with the beam should it decide to come on suddenly or if
 there is invisible IR emission.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If there is a green glow, some component in the output beam path has
  fallen off and the laser head will need to be opened and repaired.  There
  will probably be a distinct rattle of the loose part if the laser head
  is shaken (but don't do this more than necessary to confirm loose parts
  to avoid additional damage).  Depending on what fell off, the controller
  may actually go through the complete initialization.  If the Ready LED
  comes on after a few minutes (at most 6 minutes), then repair will likely
  require regluing the Second Turning Mirror and/or other optics in the output
  beam path.  If the Ready LED doesn't come on and/or the controller shuts
  down, then the Beam Sampler and/or the First Turning Mirror and/or
  Stop 2 have fallen off.  However, with green light, any damage is external
  to the laser cavity and repair should be possible, though it may not be
  very much fun.
 </u>
<p>
 <li>If there is no green glow, the controller will probably shut down
  after a minute or so and the yellow LED at the front of the laser head
  will go out.  The following tests must be done with great
  care to minimize the possibility of damage to the laser head or controller.
  It is best to change connections including multimeter probes to prevent
  transients or accidental shorts that might affect the pump diode.  If
  using the stock laser head cable (rainbow colored flat cable), fine wires
  may need to be attached to the relevant laser head pins and carefully
  routed to provide access with the cable installed.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>CAREFULLY check the voltage between pin 1 and pin 23 of the laser head.
   This is the pump diode control voltage.  If it increases to around 4.7 V,
   the controller is attempting to drive the pump diode to the current limit.
<p>
  <li>CAREFULLY check the voltage between pin 2 and pin 23 of the laser head.
   This is the pump diode current drive with a calibration of 1 A/V.  If it
   reads 2 V or more, the laser diode is likely running at its current limit.
   To confirm, power down and put a current meter in series with the pin 3 of
   the laser head to monitor the actual pump diode current.  If the result is
   the same and there is absolutely no output beam at this point, the pump
   diode is dead or the laser cavity is damaged.  This is usually a terminal
   condition for the laser head.  If there is no measured pump diode
   current or it is very low, the controller is faulty.
  </ul>
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Output power never reaches 50 percent level:</b>  Within a minute or
 so of power up, the green output power should have increased to about 50
 percent of the selected output power in preparation for the search phase of
 the controller's initialization procedure.  If the pump diode current
 limit is reached before the output power hits at least 50 percent, the
 controller may go to the search phase anyhow, though ultimate stabilization
 is unlikely.  Most of the troubleshooting in this case is similar to
 inadequate or unstable final output as discussed below.  However,
 Once the output power has stopped increaseing after initial ramp up,
 CAREFULLY check the voltage between pin 1 and pin 23 of the laser head.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the voltage is around 4.7 V, the laser diode is at its current limit
  and the controller will probably proceed assuming that before optimization,
  even 50 the percent level can't be achieved.  This may be normal.
<p>
 <li>If the voltage is less tha 4.7 V, the controller is in the search phase
  and should go to final ramp-up in 2 or 3 minutes.  If it does not, there
  may be a problem with the controller firmware.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Output power never stabilizes:</b>  After at most 6 minutes, the
 controller should have gone through the entire initialization procedure
 with the Ready LED coming on.  After 30 seconds or so following Ready,
 the output power should be close to what was selected and stable to within
 1 or 2 percent.  The actual output power is determined by a combination of the
 setting of the power level control on the control panel or autostart,
 the setting of the P6 pot on the laser head, the effective reflectance
 of the beam sampling plate inside the laser head, and the sensitivity
 of the monitor photodiode inside the laser head.  Most problems with
 power stability are due to an inability to reach the selected power level
 in which case the controller ends up in an infinite loop attempting to
 get there.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the average power after 10 minutes is less than or similar to the
  selected power but it is still fluctuating and Ready never comes on,
  the controller is probably unable to achieve at least 110 percent of
  the selected power since the diode is at its current limit.  This is
  likely due to a weak pump diode, damaged optics, or problems with
  thermal control (probably the LD TEC), or improper settings of the
  head PCB set-point pots or a problem with their circuitry.  A wrong
  initial temperature setting could result in only 10 mW of output
  instead of 150 mW at the diode current limit!
<p>
 <li>Set the control panel or autostart pot to about 10 percent of its range
  and press the Power Set button.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>If the power eventually stabilizes (give it 10 minutes), increase the
   pot setting by about 10 percent and press the Power set button again.
   Repair this until either the desired power is reached, or the laser no
   longer stabilizes.  The output power achieved on the previous iteration
   is probably near the maximum possible with this laser head.  If it is
   lower than the spec'd power (e.g., 100 mW for a C315M-100), then the
   laser head could have internal problems.
<p>
  <li>If the power still doesn't stabilize even at the 10 percent setting,
   the laser head is nearly dead, or there is something wrong with the
   the photodiode signal or the controller.
  </ul>
<p>
 <li>If the average power after 10 minutes is higher than the selected power,
  the monitor photodiode feedback signal is too low or missing.  If someone
  before you attempted to adjust P6 on the laser head, it is probably set
  way too high.  Increasing P6 to its max in an attempt to get more power
  will not work!  If it's fully counterclockwise, the feedback signal will
  be totally absent.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Where the Locktite(tm) seal has been broken, mark the
   present position of P6 and put it in the middle of its range for now.
   Then, power up again and see if the laser stabilizes at some intermediate
   power level.  If it does, see the section:
   <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclamclp">Adjusting Maximum Compass-M Laser Head
   Power</A>.
<p>
  <li>Where the Locktite(tm) seal is intact, set the pot on the control panel
   or autostart adapter to about 10 percent and see if the laser will stabilize
   there.  If so, it's still likely a problem with P6 and adjustment will
   solve the problem.  If the power still does not stabilize and is just as
   bright as ever, the monitor photodiode signal is missing due to a bad diode
   or a short circuit on the laser head PCB or inside the laser head, or
   an open connection between the laser head and controller.
  </ul>
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Laser becomes unstable sometime after stabilizing:</b>  Once the
 Ready signal (pin 15) has been on for 30 seconds, it should remain on solid
 and the output power should remain stable until the laser is turned off
 or the power level is changed.  If the laser periodically causes Ready
 to go low with associated instability in the
 output power, this usually means the efficiency of the laser is changing
 likely due to problems with the laser diode cooling.  This could be due
 to insufficient cooling of the laser head (though it's likely the laser
 will shut down due to overtemperature in this case) or one of the LD TECs
 being defective (there are 2 for the C315M).
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Make sure the laser baseplate is no more than just warm to the touch.  Add
  an additional heatsink and/or cooling if necessary.
<p>
 <li>Where this isn't the problem or doesn't help, power down the laser,
  remove the head cable, and check for continuity between pins 9 and 10,
  and separately between pins 12 and 13 of the laser head.  The measured
  resistance should be no more than a few ohms once the head has cooled
  and the temperature of internal components has equalized.  A resistance
  of more than 50 ohms may indicate a damaged TEC in which case the laser
  cannot be run on the Coherent controller at full power, but may still be
  run at reduced power, or on a home-built or third party controller, also
  possibly at reduced power.  Complete repair is not possible.
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Laser shuts down:</b> Normal shutdown is accomplished by disabling (low,
0 V) Laser On or Power On, or removing DC input power.  If the laser goes off
on its own, there is a problem with the setup, less commonly with the laser
head or controller.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser shuts down a few seconds after powering on:</b> Shutdown as
 soon as the controller attempts to turn on the pump diode indicates either
 a DC power supply problem, an open pump diode, wiring to it, or an internal
 controller problem, possibly a flakey interlock relay or connections.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Monitor DC power to the controller.  It should not fluctuate too much
  and never go below 12 VDC (for the C315M controller) while powering the
  laser.  Check for loose or inadequate wiring and bad connections if the
  power supply itself isn't defective or overloaded.
<p>
 <li>Check the laser head cable for damage, particularly to the wiring for
  pins 3 and 4 (pump diode).  An open (or possibly shorted) cable may result
  in this behavior.
<p>
 <li>Try another laser head if one is available.  Even a weak or dead laser
  head will be suitable as long as its pump diode is electrically intact.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>If the substitute head runs normally (for it) consistently - try it a
   few times to be sure - then the pump diode in the original laser head is
   probably open.  It could be bad bonding wires to the laser head connector
   inside the head, or a bad solder connection inside the laser diode package
   itself.  Bonding wires can be jumpered, the latter is usually terminal.
<p>
  <li>If the substitute head behaves the same way, the controller or cable is
   probably faulty.
  </ul>
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Laser shuts down during initialization but before stabilizing:</b>
 The only conditions that may cause the laser to actually shut off after
 it has started (Power and/or Laser Status signals go low, yellow laser
 head LED goes off) are an open interlock, serious power supply dip, thermal
 problems, or pump diode problems.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Monitor the DC power supply while the laser is initializing.  The
  voltage should not fluctuate very much and should definitely not go below
  12 VDC (for the C315M controller) at any time.
<p>
 <li>Check the integrity of the interlock wiring and temperature of the
  baseplate.  The most likely cause is excessive baseplate temperature.
  Where the cause isn't immediately obvious, measure the voltages on the
  Status signals of the User Interface Connector after the laser shuts down:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Pin 6 (Power Status): This will be low for an interlock failure but will
   probably be high if one or more of the other error conditions is present.
<p>
  <li>Pin 4 (Laser Status): This will probably be low after shutdown as the
   controller has shut off the laser.
<p>
  <li>Pin 7 (Overtemperature Status): If this signal is high, it means one
   of the internal temperatures is too high, most likely the laser
   diode since it generates the most heat.  Assuming the heatsink is cool
   enough, this could be due to a bad connection between the laser head and
   controller, or a defective laser head or controller.
<p>
  <li>Pin 12 (Heat Sink Overtemperature): Assuming the heatsink is cool to
   the touch, a high here could be due to a bad connection in the laser
   head cable or on the head PCB, or an open temperature sensor inside the
   laser head.
<p>
  <li>Pin 5 (Laser Diode Overcurrent): A high on this pin means that the
   controller is unable to properly drive the pump diode and generally
   means either the controller or laser head is defective.  However, bad
   connections could also be the cause.  If the laser diode circuit is
   open, this signal may go high despite its name.
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Beam quality problems:</b> The normal appearance of the
beam from a C315M laser is a nice Gaussian TEM00 with a very faint ghost beam
usually roughly above it at a 1 or 2 degree angle probably due to reflection
from the AR coatings of the output window.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Output beam has excessive scatter:</b> Scatter is generally caused
 by a dirty window and normal optics cleaning procedures will cure it.  It's
 better to do this with the laser off or at low power as the power density
 at the window can bake on or decompose any contaminants in the cleaning
 agent.  It would be unusual to find an internal optic causing the scatter
 unless the laser head cover was removed.
<p>
<li><b>Hole in output beam:</b>  Such a defect in the beam with a confirmed
 clean window is probably due to a speck of dust or debris on one of the
 internal optics outside the laser cavity but inside the laser head.  It
 will have to be opened and inspected.  The intense beam tends to attract
 debris and even though the laser head is supposed to be hermetically sealed,
 some may find its way to precisely the wrong places.  As such, these
 heads also tend to have other problems like low maximum power.
<p>
<li><b>Multiple spatial mode beam:</b> The beam profile of a Compass-M laser
 should always be a nice TEM00 and nearly perfectly circular.  The only likely
 cause for a beam which has multiple lobes or is seriously mishapened is damage
 to or a change in alignment of the internal optics.  There is no easy cure.
 Note that in addition to the ugly beam, the laser will likely no longer
 be single frequency, but this may only show up as ghosts or fuzzyness in
 a hologram, on a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer, or the like.
<p>
<li><b>Excessive noise/power fluctuations in beam:</b> A healthy Compass-M
 laser should produce a very clean output.  From DC to the limit of your
 oscilloscope, it should probably show less than a percent or so p-p
 amplitude variation once stabilized.  High frequency fluctuations may
 show up in conjunction with the next problem.  But, slow variations
 may indicate a controlller or thermal problem, or that the laser has
 never stabilized (Ready LED/signal not on).
<p>
<li><b>Ghost modes and oscillation:</b> In rare cases, a C215M or C315M
 may not be single frequency (not Single Longitudinal Mode or SLM).  Sometimes,
 just changing the power setting will cure this.  But, where there is an
 internal optics problem, it may have spurious modes at any power level,
 or only at higher power, or only at lower power.  When these ghost modes
 are present, there will probably be high level oscillations in the output
 power at modest frequencies (a few kHz or MHz).  There may also be multiple
 spatial (non-TEM00) modes with such a laser.  Non-SLM operation will be very
 obvious using either a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer
 (spurious modes), or simply a photodiode with a 10K ohm load and
 oscilloscope (oscillations in the output power).
<p>
 According to someone at Coherent, high frequency near 100% amplitude
 oscillation is what they call "spiking" and is a very common failure mode for
 the C215M and C315M laser heads after many (i.e., 20,000+) hours of operation.
 So, laser heads with earlier manufacturing dates are more likely to suffer
 from this malady, but of course newer ones that were run continuously
 could as well.  The cause may be KTP damage (gray tracking) or something
 else in the intracavity optics.  In any case, there's not much that can be
 done other than possibly running the laser at a power level where it isn't
 present.  On some heads this means lower power, on others it's higher power,
 or it may simply mean fine tuning the power level to keep the lasing mode
 in the sweet part of the gain curve.  I've seen occurrences of oscillations
 on several C315M laser heads for brief periods as the controller was changing
 the TEC and RES temperatures during initialization.  But these lasers always
 stabilized single frequency at any power level I tried.  Possibly, they only
 occurred near the tails of the gain curve and the laser would normally not
 settle there.  So, a laser head that produces occasional oscillations during
 initialization may not need to be assigned to flashlight duty if it
 behaves after it has stabilized.
<p>
<li><b>Low level additional longitudinal modes:</b> Some C215M and C315M
 lasers may also have a second (or possibly more) very low level modes
 at some or all power levels, some or all of the time.  I've only seen this
 once but have only recently been checking every C315M laser head for
 non-single frequency behavior.  This head seems to have a very low level
 second mode with an amplitude that varies somewhat depending on the specific
 power cycle (and thus optimized location on the gain curve) but is
 always less than 2 percent of the main mode and a few GHz away.  The
 relative location usually remains relatively fixed regardless of
 output power.  Such a low level mode would probably not cause
 problems except for the most demanding applications.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="strcpsmt">Testing of Compass-M Lasers</A></h3>

The following sections deal with techniques for determining functionality
and optimal lasing parameters without using the Coherent Analog Controller.
For general system operation, see the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsmu">Using the Coherent Analog Controller</A>.

<h4><A NAME="strc315t1">Powering the C315M for Testing 1</A></h4>

It should be possible to safely power the C315M laser head an approach optimal
conditions but everything will be done manually.  While there may be little
correlation among samples of the C315M particularly for pump diode and KTP
temperature, starting with the values listed in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315c">Coherent 315M Internal Connector Pinout</A>
won't hurt.  Just realize that differences can be quite large - even the
difference between heating and cooling of the pump diode or KTP.
<p>
This procedure may take awhile to converge but doesn't require knowing the
original factory settings on the laser head PCB (which doesn't even need to
be present).  A faster procedure which takes advantage of this information is
provided in the next section.  However, don't expect anything in the way
of long term stability or near optimal efficiency.  And without individual
temperature regulation, each of the 3 TEC settings affects the other 2 so
adjustments will be far from intuitive.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find a nice large heatsink, wipe some thermal grease on your C315M laser
 head, and smush the C315M onto the heatsink.  A fan is desirable to maintain
 heatsink temperature as constant as possible.
<p>
<li>Hook up 4 adjustable power supplies - 1 each for the upper and lower pump
 TECs, the KTP TEC, and the cavity (RES) TEC.  The upper and lower pump TECs
 can be wired in series and driven from a single power supply.  Put enough
 resistance in series with the KTP TEC to limit maximum current to about
 100 mA.
<p>
<li>Output power can be monitored with a laser power meter or by using the
 head's optical feedback photodiode using a uA meter.  The sensitivity is
 around 600 mA for 100 mW of output power.
<p>
<li>Fire up (not literally!) the pump diode using a proper laser diode driver
 and increase current until there is some green light but not to more than
 1.5 A.  DOUBLE CHECK polarity before applying power to the pump diode!!!
 Although there is a reverse protection diode on the head PCB, don't count
 on it saving you.  There is no reverse polarity protection if the head
 PCB is not present.
<p>
 Two samples of the C315M I checked had thresholds (without doing anything
 to the TECs) initially (laser at ambient conditions) of about 600 and 700 mA,
 respectively, and produced more than 10 mW at an Amp or so.  Of course,
 without TEC drive, power was very unstable and it wouldn't be advisable to
 run them for any length of time without active cooling of the pump diode.
 Temperature tuning of the pump diode using its TEC reduced the threshold
 by about 30 to 50 mA for both lasers.  A third sample - possibly damaged -
 had a threshold over 1.3 A under similar conditions and no amount of fiddling
 with all of the TEC currents would bring it down substantially.  However,
 I've heard that this could be normal and acceptable behavior without active
 temperature control and locating the "sweet" spot by random fiddling may
 be imposible where the optimal conditions aren't close to those at ambient
 temperature.  (However, I've since declared that particular head beyond hope.)
<p>
<li>Slowly increase current to the upper and lower diode TECs in the cooling
 direction (positive to the right-hand pins).  Increments of 100 mA are
 probably reasonable.  Or, start at 0.929 V and 2.268 V across the respective
 TEC and let it stabilize for several minutes.  Then, adjust from there.
 Wait a minute or two between each increment for the temperature to stabilize.
 If the intensity of the green light decreases, you're probably cooling when
 you should be heating or vice-versa.  Locate the point where green is maximum.
<p>
 There should be an optimal TEC current setting for maximum output but without
 feedback, this will depend on diode current.  However, this setting
 should be fairly independent of the KTP and cavity TECs.
<p>
<li>Set the voltage on the RES (cavity) TEC to around 1.165 VDC which is the
 value Dave found for the unit he tested.  (Don't worry about being exact.)
 This will interact with the KTP TEC setting since the KTP TEC sits on the
 cavity substrate and is the center point for the search.  Or, use a current which
 keeps the cavity substrate at around ambient temperature.
<p>
<li>Do the same with the KTP TEC either starting from 0 V or using the intial
 value of about 200 mV.  CAUTION: It's possible to destroy this TEC along with
 the KTP crystal and any hope of ever getting the laser operational again,
 especially with excessive heat.  Limit voltage to 200 mV or current
 to 100 mA to be safe.  As above, adjust for maximum green light.  If the
 intensity of the green light decreases, you're probably cooling when you
 should be heating or vice-versa.  The KTP TEC thermal response should be
 quite rapid.  As the KTP temperature changes, output power will go through
 minima and maxima.  However, not all maxima are created equal so don't
 assume that the first one you find is best - check out the entire range.
 The desired peaks will be near the center of a broad roughly bell shaped
 curve of output power (for a fixed pump diode current).  There will probably
 be several that appear strongest that aren't adjacent.  And even then, none
 of those may in fact be THE one once the cavity temperature is set correctly!
 However, given this cobbled together setup, selecting one of those will
 probably be good enough.
<p>
<li>Increase pump diode current to produce more green light if desired but
 don't exceed about 2 A through the diode since we don't know what the diode's
 maximum ratings are.  However, the maximum current specs for the diodes I've
 seen (in C315M heads opened for one reason or another) were in the 2.4 to
 2.6 A range.  Note: While Dave insists on that reading of 2.8 V for
 1.8 A, I measured a more normal 2 V or so on the unit I tested so I would 
 recommend going by current, not voltage.
<p>
<li>Then go back and re-tweak the diode, KTP, and RES TECs.  After
 increasing diode current, the best operating point may have jumped by
 a few KTP peaks so check out a few in the neighborhood.  You will need
 to keep re-tweaking everything for maximum green and to keep the diode safe.
<p>
<li>CAUTION: KEEP AN EYE on diode current if running this without automatic
 control (but hopefully, you are using a diode driver that will do this for
 you!).
</ol>
<p>
If this hasn't been totally confusing, the one conclusion that should be
drawn is that doing the adjustments based on the factory settings will be
a whole lot easier especially where the optimal KTP and cavity TEC settings
aren't near room temperature!  There is so much interaction that making any
sense of what's going on is a true challenge.
<p>
Be happy if this procedure results in 75 percent of rated power at 1.75
to 2 A. The precision needed for optimal performance has to maintain all three
TECs to within less than 0.01 &deg;C!  There is no way to achieve this
without most excellent temperature regulation.  But at least it will have
proven that the laser head is reasonably healthy and obtaining or constructin
a suitable controller will be worthwhile.

<h4><A NAME="strc315t2">Powering the C315M for Testing 2</A></h4> 

The following procedure should converge on the proper operating conditions
quite quickly because it uses the factory settings for
the temperatures of the pump diode, KTP, and cavity.  However, the laser head
PCB must be present with all adjustments at their original factory settings.
However, don't expect anything in the way of long term stability or near
optimal efficiency.  And without individual temperature regulation, each of
the 3 TEC settings affects the other 2 so adjustments will be far from
intuitive.
<p>
In addition to a proper laser diode driver, three adjustable power supplies
for the TECs: 0 to 3 VDC at 1 A or so for the diode and cavity (RES) TECs; 0
to 200 mV at 100 mA MAX for the KTP TEC and a low current 5 VDC supply for the
laser head PCB will be required.
<p>
A DMM or VOM will be needed to check factory settings and monitor temperature
sensors and laser diode current.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Wire up a cable for the laser head.  Connections will be required for
 the pump diode (2 wires), all the TECs (8 wires), temperature sensors (3
 wires), the photodiode output voltage (1 wire), and the +5 and common (2
 wires).  Including power to the LED with its return connected to common is
 also a good idea so the LED will come on whenever the system is powered.
 Also including connections for each of the set-point pots (5 wires) and the
 LD Current Control (1 wire) will make taking measurements easier.  The
 output of the light feedback photodiode can be fed to an oscilloscope or
 fast responding voltmeter to monitor output power.
<p>
<li>Apply +5 VDC between pins 25 (+5) and 23 (Common) and measure the outputs
 of each of the temperature set-point pots with respect to pin 23.  Record
 these values.  A voltage greater than 2.5 V means that the specified
 component needs to be cooled relative to 25 &deg;C (positive current
 into/voltage on the TEC+ pin); a voltage less than 2.5 V means it needs
 to be heated (negative current into/voltage on the TEC+ pin).  Based on
 the thermistors used in the Coherent 532 laser, the temperature sensitivity
 of the Temp Sense outputs would be about -50 mV/&deg;C near 2.5 V (but these
 things aren't perfectly linear!).  Thus, a decrease of 100 mV represents
 a change of +2 &deg;C.  However, I do not know for sure that the same
 thermistors are used for the C315M.
<p>
<li>Find a nice large heatsink, wipe some thermal grease on your C315M laser
 head, and screw the C315M to the heatsink.  A fan is desirable to maintain
 heatsink temperature as constant as possible.  Although some of the photos
 show a heatsink the same size as the laser head, one that is much larger
 will be better especially if airflow is limited.
<p>
<li>Attach an adjustable power supply to the pump diode TECs (suggest 0 to
 5 V, 1 A max).  The polarity of the power supply is determined by the set-point
 value as described above.  The upper and lower diode TECs
 can be connected in series - I've done this for testing and it appears to
 work well.  This is the most critical of the TECs since it needs to
 keep the pump diode happy as well as wavelength tuning to around 808 nm to
 maximize absorption by the YAG crystal which will want the wavelength as
 close to the peak between 808 and 809 nm as possible.
<p>
<li>Attach an adjustable power supply to the KTP TEC (suggest 0 to 200 mV,
 100 mA max or more easily, 0 to 5 V with a 50 ohm, 2 W current limiting
 resistor in series).  CAUTION: Excessive current into the KTP TEC,
 particularly in the heating direction, can ruin it.  Don't neglect the
 current limiting!
<p>
<li>Attach an adjustable power supply to the RES (cavity) TEC (suggest 0 to
 5 V, 1 A max).
<p>
<li>While monitoring the voltage between the LD Temp Sense and LD Temp
 Set-Point pins, very slowly increase voltage to the LD TECs.  As the LD
 heats or cools as appropriate, the voltage difference should decrease if your
 polarity is correct.  "Very slowly" means perhaps 100 mV, wait 2 minutes,
 then 200 mV, wait another 2 minutes, and so forth.  There is a significant
 amount of thermal inertia in the LD TECs - be patient.  Once the voltage
 difference between the sense and set-point pins is fairly small (perhaps 10
 mV), continue on with the procedure.
<p>
<li>Using your proper laser diode driver, power up the pump diode until there
 is some green light but not to more than 1.5 A for now.  DOUBLE CHECK polarity
 before applying power to the pump diode!!!!  If there is no green
 output even at 1.5 A, don't panic yet.  Go back to the previous step and
 readjust the LD TEC voltage - the additional power dissipation of the pump
 diode will have changed its required setting.  Even if there is still no
 green output when you get back to this step, there is still no need to panic,
 at least not seriously, as the KTP temperature may be way off.  However,
 all samples of healthy C315Ms I've tested had a threshold of between 0.6
 and 0.7 A with no drive to the TECs.
<p>
<li>While monitoring the voltage between the RES Temp Sense and RES Temp
 Set-Point pins, very slowly increase voltage to the RES TECs.  As the cavity
 heats or cools as appropriate, the voltage difference should decrease if your
 polarity is correct.  "Very slowly" means perhaps 100 mV, wait 2 minutes,
 then 200 mV, wait another 2 minutes, and so forth.  There is a significant
 amount of thermal inertia in the RES TECs - be patient.  Once the voltage
 difference between the sense and set-point pins is fairly small (perhaps 10
 mV), continue on with the procedure.
<p>
<li>While monitoring the voltage between the KTP Temp Sense and the KTP Temp
 Set-Point pins, slowly increase voltage to the KTP TEC.  As the KTP
 heats or cools as appropriate, the voltage difference should decrease if your
 polarity is correct.  "Slowly" means perhaps 10 mV, wait 10 seconds,
 then 20 mV, wait another 10 seconds, and so forth.  There is some
 amount of thermal inertia in the KTP TEC but not nearly as much as the
 LD.  Once the voltage difference between the sense and set-point pins is
 fairly small (perhaps 10 mV), continue on with the procedure.
<p>
<li>There should definitely be some green light at this point.  If there isn't
 even at 1.5 A of laser diode drive current, something is wrong - power down
 and determine what it is.  It may be time to panic if no problems can be
 found.
<p>
<li>Now go back and tweak each of the three TEC voltages to reduce the
 difference between the associated sense and set-point voltages.  Once the
 LD and KTP temperatures have stabilized close to these values, conditions
 should be near optimal.  The RES temperature isn't nearly as critical but
 will interact with the other two.  Whenever the LD current is changed,
 its TEC will need to be adjusted but if the laser head is on a large
 hetasink, there should be minimal interaction with the other TECs.
</ol>
<p>
The next set of steps will attempt to maximize output power within safe limits.
<p>
<ol start=13>
<li>With +5 VDC applied to the PCB, also apply +4.7 VDC to the LD Current
 Control (pin 1).  (Using +4.7 VDC for both pins 1 and 25 should be close
 enough or generate the +4.7 VDC with a voltage divider consisting of a 300
 ohm and 4.7K ohm resistor.)  Measure the voltage on pin 2.  This value
 is the pump diode current limit setting.  It will probably be in the 2 to 2.5
 V range meaning 2 to 2.5 A.  DO NOT EXCEED THIS VALUE of current to the pump
 diode under any circumstances, even for 1 nanosecond!  In fact, I would not
 recommend exceeding 2 A on any unit unless you know what a safe current is
 for the pump diode.  Use at your own risk! Even 2 A may be above the
 diode current limit - I've seen a few units which were slightly lower.
<p>
<li>Measure the voltage on the Photodiode Anode (pin 24, Vpd).  The actual
 output power in mW is equal to (Vpd/2.5)*100 assuming the PD pot (P6) is
 at the original factory setting.  However, note that some surplus units will
 have a Vpd that is high by up to 25 percent or more possibly due to
 contamination on the beam sampler plate increasing the light seen by the
 photodiode.  All of the units I've seen like this would operate normally
 with an adjustment to P6.
<p>
<li>After confirming that the three TECs are maintaining their temperatures
 near the optimum values, *slowly* increase pump diode current while measuring
 Vpd.  On a typical C315M, the rated output occurs at around 1.8 to 2 A of pump
 diode current.  If your laser achieves this, congratulations!  If it isn't
 even close, go back and attempt to figure out what's wrong.  Realize that some
 of these are used lasers and may not be able to achieve rated output under
 any conditions.  Even if your laser is able to run at full power, there is
 nothing wrong with running it at reduced power as this will greatly extend
 pump diode life.  However, the factory temperature set-points will no longer
 be quite correct.
</ol>
<p>
Be happy if this procedure results in 75 percent of rated power at 1.75 to
2 A.  The precision needed for optimal performance has to maintain all three
TECs to within less than 0.01 &deg;C!  There is no way to achieve this
without most excellent temperature regulation.  But at least it will have
proven that the laser head is reasonably healthy and obtaining or constructin
a suitable controller will be worthwhile.

<h4><A NAME="strc315l">Description and Measurements for each of the C315M
 Laser Head Signals</A></h4>

Voltages in [] correspond to measured values after 10 minute warmup for a
C315M that meets specs in an ambient temperature of about 68 &deg;F with a
small fan keeping the heatsink cool (24 V mini fan running at 12 V).  Voltages
may be quite erratic during warmup.  All voltages are positive with respect
to pin 23 (Common) unless otherwise noted (for individual components).
Everything is isolated from the metal chassis.  Note that these values only
apply to a specific C315M head.  Most values for another head or even this
one run at some other output power may not be at all similar.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pin 1 - Laser Diode (LD) Current Control:</b> This is an input from
 the controller that varies LD current based on the ILD (P1) pot setting on the
 head PCB.  Its range is from 0 to about 4.7 V in about 100 steps from a D/A
 in the controller.  4.7 V will result in an LD current at its current limit.
 Most C315M-100 pump diodes have a current limit of 1.9 to 2.6 A.
 [3.121 V.]
<p>
 Initial turn on: 0.599 V.  Climbed up to 1.8 V smoothly within 5 seconds.
 Held at 1.941 V for about 1 minute.  Then slow climb to a stable 3.121 V and
 holding.
<p>
 Note: If pin 1 is not connected, the Analog Controller will appear to start
 through its search routine but will get stuck in an infinite loop with
 output power varying at 1 or 2 Hz and there will be no response to the
 power set command.  However, no damage appears to result to either the
 controller or laser head.  When the laser diode is off, the voltage on
 this pin will be slightly lower than whatever previous value it had.
<p>
<li><b>Pin 2 - Laser Diode (LD) Current/Limit:</b> Wiper of ILD (P1) pot will
 equal the LD current during operation with the sensitivity of 1 A/V.  It will
 represent the LD current limit when Pin 1 is at about 4.7 VDC.  [1.851 V
 after power stabilized corresponding to 1.851 A through the diode.]
<p>
 Depending on the setting of P1, For a diode with the smallest Imax of 1 A
 (P1 fully CCW), the LD current can vary between about 0.29 and 1 A; for for
 a diode with the highest Imax of 2.95 A (P1 fully CW), from 0.86 to 2.9 A.
 The smallest increment of current change (1 D/A step) for any particular
 laser head will be around 1/100th of the difference between the lowest
 current and Imax for the particular diode.
<p>
 Values during warmup not measured but should be predictable from
 <A HREF="315cct1.pdf">Schematic of C315M Laser Head PCB (Common Wiring)</A>.
 With the laser diode off, this pin measures 0 V regardless of the voltage
 on Pin 1 so it must be actively shorted to the Common inside the controller.
<p>
<li><b>Pin 3 - Laser Diode Anode (LD+)</b> Attached to the metal frame
 and case of the LD (but NOT of the laser head since the diode sits on its
 own platform which is insulated from everything else).  There is a 100 ohm
 resistor on the LD itself and a reverse protection diode and 0.1 uF
 capacitor on the head PCB across LD+ and LD-.  [Not measured directly.]
<p>
<li><b>Pin 4 - Laser Diode Cathode (LD-, isolated)</b> [Not measured directly.]
<p>
 <b>Laser diode:</b> Pin 3 (+) to pin 4 (-).  Initial turn on: 1.1 V smoothly
 climbing to 2.529 V within 5 seconds, then slow creep over 10 minutes to
 a rock solid 2.805 V.  Current with DMM in series with pin 3: 1.825 A.
 Note that since the actual laser diode doesn't drop more than about 2 V,
 the remainder is due to the resistance of the internal wiring, mostly from the
 traces on the ceramic substrate and a bit from the bonding wires.  Another
 unit showed 2.64 V between pins 3 and 4 but only 1.95 V at the diode itself.
<p>
 Based on my measurements of more than 50 C315M laser heads at around 100 mW
 output power, the current reading of 1.825 A probably means the diode is
 quite healthy.  It is toward the lower end of the range of operating currents
 for those tested.  Typical diode specs (engraved on diode) for one of these
 laser heads are: 0.70 A lasing threshold for green output, 1.75 A operating
 current at rated power, and 2.43 maximum (probably current limit setting).
 See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315i">Typical C315M Pump Diode
 Current</A>.
<p>
<li><b>Pin 5 - Laser Diode Temperature Sensor Thermistor</b>.  This is an NTC
 thermistor with a nominal resistance of 10K ohms at 25 &deg;C.  (Actual
 measured value of 10.4K ohms at about 20 &deg;C.)  The required 10K ohm

<ul>
<li>TEC polarity specified based on which direction which cools selected
 component.  The TEC resistance measurements don't really mean very much
 since the I/V response of a TEC is quite non-linear, especially at the low
 voltage/current used by a DMM.  In fact, while these produced apparently
 valid resistance readings in one direction, reversing the leads of the
 DMM resulted in a reading of exactly 0.00 ohms!  This is due to the slight
 voltage produced by the TEC junctions when a temperature difference is
 present totally confusing the microbrain of the DMM.  Furthermore, making
 the same measurements with a VOM resulted in much lower resistance readings.
 Conclusion: About all that can really be tested is that the TEC is not open
 or shorted.

<h4><A NAME="strc315i">Typical C315M Pump Diode Current</A></h4>

There are usually three numbers engraved on the top of the laser diode case
*inside* each C315M laser head.  So, this information isn't really accessible
to the user.  (And, even if the head is opened, the scribed numbers are often
illegible and sometimes not even visible, being on the <i>bottom</i> of the
laser diode package!)  I believe these are the threshold current (for green
lasing), operating current (at rated output), and maximum current (safe for
the diode).  The current limit for the Coherent Analog Controller is set by
the P1 (ILD) pot on the head PCB.  (I do not know if the scribed value and
P1 pot settings match or if the latter is a slightly more conservative value.
On one unit, the scribed current limit was 2.43 A while the measured maximum
current was 2.40 A but this discrepancy is within the test equipment and power
tolerances.)
<p>
Thus, it's possible to determine a safe current limit without opening the
case assuming the head PCB is intact and the P1 (ILD) pot hasn't been touched.
Apply +5 VDC to pin 25, +4.7 VDC to pin 1, and the return to pin 23.  (Using
+4.7 VDC for both pins 1 and 25 should be close enough or generate the
+4.7 VDC with a voltage divider consisting of a 300 ohm and 4.7K ohm
resistor.)  Measure the voltage between pin 2 and pin 23.  This will be
the diode current limit with 1 A/V calibration.  For example, if you
measure 2.40 V, then the maximum current is 2.40 A.
<p>
If using the Coherent Analog Controller, the current limit can also be
determined by measuring the voltages on pins 1 and 2 once the laser has
stabilized.  For heads where the resistances in the P1 pot circuit
match the <A HREF="315cct1.pdf">Schematic of C315M Laser Head PCB (Common
Wiring)</A>, Imax will be equal to:
<p>
<PRE>
                               1 + (0.4802 * 4.7)
        Imax = V(Pin 2) * [-------------------------]
                            1 + (0.4802 * V(Pin 1))
</PRE>
<p>
And the percent of Imax will then be: Iop/Imax*100.  This is probably the
most useful single parameter in determining the diode's health and life
expectancy.
<p>
This equation has been accurate with nearly all of the C315M heads for
which I've taken data, almost 100 at this point.  It failed with only
a single C315M-100 and a single C315M-150 so it's possible that some
heads - have different resistance values in the P1 pot circuit.  For those
units, R8 was 20K instead of 75K so the 0.4802 in the equation above needs
to change to about 1.65.  I discovered this discrepancy because I have an
Excel spreadsheet that automatically calculates Imax based on both
the search current (Is) and operating current (Io) of each laser tested.
Is and Io usually differ significantly but the calculated values of Imax
should of course be the same.  Most of the time, they match to within
better than 1 percent.  However, for ID# 150-3, the error was almost 8
percent.  I then used an ohmmeter to check resistance values on the
head PCB and found the rogue R8.  Later, I found another head, 150-4, with
a similar value for R8.  I rather suspect that the C315M-100 with the
20K R8 was really destined to be a C315M-150 but didn't quite make
it in the output power versus diode current department.  And, the
lone C215M-20 that I actually checked behaves still differently.  For
that head, the magic parameter needed to be set to 0.236.  R8 was the
standard 75K but R9 was around 1.1K.
<p>
I have constructed a breakout box with a switch to select between pin 1 and
pin 2, along with a pair of jacks for meter probes so that I can monitor
the LD control control and resulting current on any C315M lasers I test.
This is part of my custom C315M controller-to-head cable assembly that also
allows adjustment of the output power (P6) pot without removing the head
connector.  Although I'm currently just using a switch with some 1K ohm
isolation resistors, it would be best to add a high impedance op-amp
buffer to each input with the switch selecting between the two op-amp
outputs.  This would reduce loading and prevent any possibility of
switching transients affecting the laser diode current control.
<p>
Once pin 1 and pin 2 voltages has been measured, it's a simple matter to
plug then into the equation above to determine the diode current limit.
<p>
From various units that were opened *and* where the scribed vales were visible
and legible, here are some typical values:

The Head ID#s are arbitrary except for 100-1 and 100-24 which are the same
units that appear in the table of measurements, below.  The order started out
being by increasing operating current but after X8, I decided to just add
them at the end. :)  I was able to test several diodes removed from the laser heads
but still in their case with GRIN lens:

</PRE>
<p>
The measured threshold current may be lower than the labeled value since
this is the threshold for the diode, not for green lasing (if that's what
the markings on the diode really mean).
There may also be a +/-10 percent measurement error.  When my LaserCheck
starts smoking due to the high power, I tend not to leave it in the
beam too long. :)  Those values marked with "*" were estimated.
I wasn't sure that these diodes were healthy but
based on the thresholds being close to the marked values and the
slop efficiency of about 0.9 W/A for both, my conclusions
are that they are.  (I had been using them to test a C315M that
was weak.  Its case had been cleanly cut off using a Dremel rotary
tool so the diodes could be replaced easily.  However, I have to
assume now that there is indeed something wrong with the laser
cavity or optics, not the diodes.)
<p>
In fact, thea relatively high thresholds for all these diodes suggests that
they are capable of a lot more than the 1 W or so that corresponds to the
marked maximum current.  A threshold of 0.7 A is more typical of a
2 W diode with a 200 um stripe.
<p>
And one that had its cover removed so there was no GRIN lens, just the raw
diode:

</PRE>
<p>
There were no markings on this particular diode.  I don't know whether the
lower slope efficiency is due to a tired worn diode or whether it is not
the same type of diode as the others.  Powers marked with "*" were
estimated.
<p>
When new, many samples of the C315M-100 can probably produce 150 mW or
more without exceeding the maximum current rating of the diode.
(At least one unit I was testing did so when I accidentally set
the P6 output power pot too high!)  As they are run, the pump diode
gradually degrades so that over several thousand hours at
rated power, the required current will creep up towards the
maximum value.  When it exceeds the maximum value, the
controller will be unable to achieve full output power.
<p>
However, from what I've seen testing many surplus C315M lasers, very weak
pump diodes are relatively rare.  So causes for low output power may be more
likely due to contamination on the optics resulting in either lower power
out of the laser cavity or stabilizing at a lower power level due to
increased scatter from the beam pickoff to the photosensor.
<p>
The following table shows the measured pump diode current for a
batch of surplus C315M heads.  Except for head ID#s 100-Y1 and 100-Y2, they
were all run on the same Coherent Analog Controller.  (There can be a slight
variation in output power set-point - perhaps a few percent - using
different controllers even though they should have identical specs.
There can also be a similar variation from run to run as slightly
different "optimal" settings are found by the controller.)
<p>
Head ID# 100-Y1 was missing the head PCB and had to be tested on an
ILX Lightwave LDC-3900 laser diode controller rather than with the Coherent
Analog Controller.  Thus, there is no value for Is.  Head ID# 100-Y2 was
also tested in this manner because it's lower LD TEC was open and had to
be bypassed, so I was afraid the Coherent Analog Controller might be
unhappy.  See the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclccilx">Powering the C315M
with the ILX Lightwave Model LDC-3900</A>.
<p>
All heads were set for an output power of between 100 and 105 mW (except the
50-1 which was set at 52 mW and the 150-1 which was set at 162 mW).  Setting
the power more precisely than 5 percent is difficult with the small somewhat
difficult to access P6 pot.
<p>
The current was monitored by installing a 0.1 ohm precision
resistor in series with the laser diode anode (pin 3) of the
head connector and reading the voltage across it.  Thus, the
conversion would be 10 A/V.  A pair of 1K ohm resistors isolated
the sense resistor leads from the DMM to prevent damage to the
pump diode or controller due to accidental shorts or bad
connections.

The ID#s are arbitrary and their order does not mean anything.  But in
general, it does appear that heads with earlier manufacturing dates (which
I didn't record unfortunately) tend to have slightly higher operating current
(Iop), but it's not that much on average.  This might be expected to be due
to a harder and longer life but it turns out that other factors may be
more important.  My assumption was that a lower operating current implied
more headroom on the pump diode but it turns out that the actual current
limit for each diode can vary from slightly under 2.0 A to over 2.6 A
depending on the particular sample of the C315M.  There is more on this
below.
<p>
Head ID# 100-1 had to be opened
because the second stop (just after the OC mirror) had fallen off
and was blocking the beam path.  It now works fine, minus this stop,
and can produce at least 120 mW.  So, it is now my demo unit with a
Plexiglas cover.  Although the operating current has increased by almost
500 mA compared to the original value, it's still way below the maximum.
(Actually, the increase isn't as bad as it appears since the measured
current was at 106 mW for this laser.)
I assume the increase is due to age and use but whatever trauma caused
the stop to fall off could also have been at least partially responsible.
(I have another C315M-100 head that had both the first turning mirror and
output lens fall off but appears healthy otherwise.  There is a lot of
green but it doesn't go anywhere including the monitor photodiode.  This
will require a 6-axis positioner to remount the mirror at least as it is
difficult to access and the movement of the beam is counterintuitive due
to the double reflection.  So regluing by hand isn't an option - I tried!)
<p>
Head ID# 100-24 also had to be opened, in its case because the second
turning mirror had fallen off.  It's now reglued with 5 minute Epoxy
(positioned by hand to shoot the beam cleanly through the output stop)
while the laser was powered) and works fine.  It's operating current
has increased by less than 150 mA from the original value (at 100 mW,
current above was measured at 105 mW).
<p>
What can be inferred from the data above is that the search
current isn't necessarily a good indication of a head's health.
In other words, a head with a high search current can still have
a relatively low operating current.  But a low search current
relative to the operating current would imply that optimal LD, KTP,
and RES are probably close to ambient.  And there is even one where
both currents are identical - it's just a coincidence.  Really! :)
From a cold start, the search current seems to be almost identical
if a head is powered up at different times.  However, it can vary
significantly if restarted when warm.  This isn't surprising given
that the search current is determined by being set so the output
power is between about 40 and 50 percent of the set-point based
on the power monitor voltage.  Operating current may also differ
somewhat depending on initial conditions.  And, if the output power
is adjusted via the P6 pot, the Iop may differ substantially next time
the laser is powered up.
<p>
Note the similarity between the C315M-50 and C315M-100 currents.  This
suggests that that not surprisingly, the -50 doesn't have different
construction but is probably just a derated -100, though possibly one that
would be marginal or have insufficient headroom at 100 mW, though they may
have a lower power pump diode.  Or units that
just have the power turned down or a different value resistor installed
to limit the maximum power setting. :)  Similarly, this appears to
also be the case (in reverse) for the C315M-150 - that these
are simply very lively -100s selected for their high power.  I've seen a
sample of a C315M-100 easily do 150 mW and that unit wasn't notable in any
particular respect other than that it was one of the lower current units
listed above.  The one true -150 actually produces 162 mW at the 1.93 A
current listed above.  This current is lower than for many of the -100ss
at 100 to 106 mW.
<p>
Here is another batch of Compass-M laser heads
tested with more complete data that includes the voltage
on Pin 1 after the laser stabilizes.  Imax was then computed via an
Excel spreadsheet based on the equation given above.  All were tested
on C315M controllers except for the C215Ms where Is is not specified,
though not necessarily the same one.

So, a more accurate estimate of health might be to say that anything
under 4 V on Pin 1 is in good shape and those close to or under 3 V
are in really superb condition.  Or by Percent Current Limit, roughly 90% and
75%, respectively.  Note that the output power values are
NOT the maximums but what the P6 pot was set at.  So, if all the heads
were set at exactly 100 mW, the currents would have to be adjusted
downward by between 10 and 20 mA per 1 mW of the excess.  And 100-164
was set really high at 132 mW by the user, so its health is a lot better
than it appears based on %Imax.
<p>
150-1 looks like it could run at 200 mW well
below its diode current limit, but I don't know if the optics would survive.
Also, since the LD TEC setting is optimized for the rated power, it might
need to be changed to provide the proper cooling at the higher diode current.
So I am not going to try!  Confirming previous suspicions, the diode current
limit, while at the high end compared to the typical C315M-100, isn't so high
as to suggest that it's a different model diode (though it might have
been specially selected).

150-2 is running quite close to its diode current limit, which <i>is</i> a bit
higher than the current limit of any of the C315M-100s I've tested.  It outputs
approximately 180 mW at the current limit.  However, while it passes all
the basic tests, this laser was later found to have a severe mode problem and
in particular, does not run single frequency at all, ever, and exhibits wild
high frequency output power fluctuations.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcc3mp">Coherent C315M Laser Heads - Mode Problems</A>.
I later found a C315M-100 that had a similar malady.
<p>
150-6, which has plenty of headroom on the diode, was subsequently found
to have a problem with "ringing" - the output power would often not stabilize
at all, or not stabilize in a reasonable amount of time.  This problem was
missed originally.  See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcc3ns">Coherent
C315M Laser Head - Does Not Reliably Stabilize</A>.
<p>
And, as with the other C315M-50, the values are very similar to those of the
typical C315M-100.  I had to open this one to repair the bonding wires as
the diode was electrically open.  Not surprisingly, the construction was
identical to that of a C315M-100 of similar vintage.  Taken together, these
further confirm that C315M-50s are probably just mediocre C315M-100s, though
possibly with a lower power (possibly also specially selected) pump diode.
<p>
And, no, that's not a typo.  The C215M-75 is physically similar to a C315M
except that some or all are in a higher quality case and lack the RES TEC and its
associated set-point pot (though the RES temperature sensor is present) and
upper LD TEC.  It will still run on the Coherent C315M Analog Controller
though I don't know if the efficiency and stability are equal to what they
would be with the proper controller).
This particular sample of a C215M-75 could also pass as either a
tired but still healthy C315M-100 or a very lively C315M-50.
<p>
There were also a few weak heads:

<p>
I had originally thought these all probably had weak pump diodes or
some other internal problem.  But I have now determined that the problem
with 100-W2 and 100-W8 was a defective resistor on the head PCB.  On, 100-W2,
R10 has been replaced and this laser head now easily achieves full power.
100-W8 was originally very weak (power not recorded) and then run with an
external pot and 120K ohm resistor providing the same voltage as would
be provided by P2, which is where the current and power numbers, above,
came from.  R10 on this laser head has now been replaced and it too operates
well.  See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcc3wl1">Coherent
C315M Laser Heads - Weak Lasing 1</A>.  Possibly 100-W1 has a similar
problem but I no longer have access to it for testing.
<p>
100-W4, 100-W5, and 100-W7 behave more normally but just appear weak.
So, they may indeed have tired pump diodes or slightly contaminated
optics.
<p>
100-W3 is included here because although it can produce over 100 mW
with optimal conditions at the current limit, it will not reliably
stabilize at or above 100 mW using the Coherent Analog Controller.
There would probably be no problem on the LDC-3900 but I no longer
have access to this head either.
<p>
100-W6 had an interesting beam profile in that the center was missing!
This was traced to contamination on the first turn mirror.
Indeed, the <i>inside</i> surface of the output window also had excessive
scatter.  Perhaps hermetic seals aren't all they're cracked up to be. :)
<p>
100-W9 was behaving somewhat like it had an open R10 but this was
not the case.  It appeared as though the setting of the TL pot (P2)
was not quite correct but even when adjusted slightly, the laser would
not stabilize in the 100 to 106 mW range, jumping over it and confusing
the Coherent Analog Controller algorithm.  Here is some data after
adjusting P2:

</PRE>
<p>
While the 103 mW output power could be obtained under some conditions, it
wasn't consistent.  From full power off, output power would usually jump
from below 100 mW to over 110 mW suddenly, thus confusing the controller
algorithm and resulting in an infinite loop.  So I have left P6 set for
110 mW where it seems to be happy, at least for now.
<p>
Head 75-W1 actually produced more than 100 mW at times but will not stabilize
at any power level on a C215M controller, and only sporadically on a C315M
controller.  But when run on the LDC-3900, it would easily do more
than 75 mW at 1.5 A in a stable manner with no indication of any abnormal
behavior.  There was a lack of solder on one end of the
surface mount 120K ohm resistor to the P2 (LD temperature) pot.  When
that was repaired, its health was restored and is now labled 75-102, above.

<h4><A NAME="strc315m">Measurements of Compass-M TEC I/V Characterstics</A></h4>

The following tests were done with a bench supply and are very
approximate since the I/V relationship may change by 10 percent or
more depending on actual TEC temperature and this changes while
attempting to take readings!  The first set if for the C315M laser head:
<p>
<PRE>
    C315M TEC   - Pins +   0.25 A   0.5 A    1.0 A    1.5 A    2.0 A
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cavity (RES)  18 to 19      3 V   4.7 V      8 V     10 V      -
      KTP       15 to 17    0.6 V   1.2 V      -        -        -
    Upper LD    12 to 13      -     1.2 V    2.5 V    3.5 V      5 V
    Lower LD     9 to 10    2.8 V   4.7 V    7.5 V     12 V
</PRE>
<p>
Next, is the only measurement done on the C215M laser head's single LD TEC:
<p>
<PRE>
    C215M TEC   - Pins +   0.25 A   0.5 A    1.0 A    1.5 A    2.0 A
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
       LD       9 to 10       -       -        -        -      2.5 V
</PRE>
<p>
There's only one entry because I only did a test at a single input
voltage just to see if there would be any problem driving both of the
C315M LD TECs in parallel from the C215M controller. :)  I would assume
that the KTP TEC characteristics should be similar.  The C215M laser
has no RES TEC.
<p>
In all cases, heating the specified item was accomplished with the polarity
shown because it was easier to check for cooling on the bottom plate.
(I couldn't confirm polarity for the KTP - too small - but based on the
arrangement of pads on the TEC, should be the same.  This has since been
confirmed by connecting the TECs to a commercial driver and verifying correct
closed loop behavior.)  The fact that some
voltages are equal at the same current is just a coincidence.
<p>
Note that I have removed any reference to measured TEC resistance as this
is not a reliable indication of TEC health.  This is due to the generated
voltage confusing the reading if there is any temperature difference between
the two sides of the TEC.  Suffice it to say that the measured resistance
for the C315M TECs in at least one direction should be very
low, probably under 1 ohm.  I've seen two cases where the lower LD TEC
was defective and reading between 30 and 200 ohms, resulting in an "Open
TEC" error when attempting to drive it on the LDC-3900.  Bypassing that
TEC would allow the system to run on the LDC-3900, but only if on a really
good forced air-cooled heatsink since heat had to flow by conduction through
the dead lower TEC.  However, I do not know how such a condition could
arise other than due to a random failure, possibly exacerbated by running
the laser under extreme environmental conditions.  The LD and RES TECs should
be capable of handling several amps without damage, more than could be
applied by either the Coherent Analog Controller or LDC-3900.

<h4><A NAME="strc315ta">Test Adapters for the Coherent Analog
 Controller</A></h4>

In addition to the various control panels described in the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsmx">Compass-M Laser Control Panels</A>, I have
constructed a pair of adapters for the DB15 user interface and the DB25
laser head cables.  I have a limited number of bare (unpopulated) printed
circuit boards available for both of these.
<p>
<b>Coherent Compass-M User Interface Signal Monitor</b>: This PCB has a DB15F
and DB15M and goes in-line between the Analog Controller User Interface
connector and the control panel cable as shown in
<A HREF="ccsmp1.jpg">Photo of Coherent Compass-M User Interface Signal
Monitor</A>.  It has 10 LEDs which show 5 VDC,
Interlock, Power On (input), Laser On (input), Power On (status), Laser On
(status), Ready, Heat Sink Overtemp (status), Overtemp (status), and
Overcurrent (status).  Except for the 5 VDC and Interlock, all signals are
buffered with a 74HCT240.  (A 74LS240 may also work on some controllers
as long as the Power On and Laser On inputs have less than 1K ohms to GND
in the off state.  However, on one controller, the Ready LED came on
prematurely with a level of 1.1 V so perhaps the drive on that signal at least
really is whimpy.)  The LEDs have internal current limiting resistors
so there isn't much on the PCB!  For normal operation, this widget doesn't do
much other than confirm what you probably already know.  So other than being
able to say your system has a light display, it isn't a "must have" but comes
in handy for diagnosis if the system doesn't start reliably or the controller
shuts down unexpectedly.
<p>
<b>C315M Laser Head Signal Breakout Adapter:</b> This PCB has a DB25F and DB25M
and goes in-line between the Analog Controller laser head connector and the

attaching a DMM or oscilloscope to monitor most of the drive and sensor
signals on the C315M laser head.  There are separate headers for LD drive
signals; LD, KTP, and RES temperature signals; and power monitoring signals.
LEDs confirm the presense of DC input and 5 VDC.  Jumper plugs may be removed
to install a meter to monitor the current to the LD or any of the TECs.
(Change connections with power off ONLY!)

<h4><A NAME="strc315dp">C315M Laser Diagnostic Control Panel</A></h4>

This unit will go between the Coherent Analog Controller or home-built or
third party laser diode controller and the C315M laser head.  It would also
attach to the DB15 user interface connector and include all control panel

the C215M and C415M lasers.  Here are the tentative specifications:

<h4><A NAME="strc315du">Simplified C315M Laser Diagnostic Unit</A></h4>

I have built a subset of the C315M Laser Diagnostic Control Panel which
I call the "C315M Diagnostic Unit" or CDU.  It provides the functionality
needed to evaluate C315M laser performance and is what I routinely use for
testing and troubleshooting of complete C315M systems, laser heads, and
controllers.  The CDU is a combination of "C315M Control Panel 1" and
"C315M Laser Diode/Output Power Monitor" (see the
section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclcpsmx">Compass-M Laser Control Panels</A>),
along with "Coherent Compass-M User Interface Signal Monitor" (see the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315ta">Test Adapters for the Coherent Analog
Controller</A>).  See <A HREF="315mdus1.jpg">Photo of C315M Diagnostic
Unit Setup</A>.  The signal monitor shows all green lights (no errors) and
the output power readout is 104.2 mW from one of my "visible" (Plexiglas
top) C315M-100 laser heads. :)  The DC power supply that I generally use
puts out 12 VDC at 6.6 A max.  This has proven to be quite adequate for all
C315M laser heads, even C315M-150s.  For extended operation, a small fan is
used to cool the laser head heatsink.
<p>
The CDU provides for:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Control:</b> Power On, Laser On, Power Level, and Power Set.  (C315M
 Control Panel 1 in the black plastic box.)
<p>
<li><b>User interface status:</b> LEDs for logic levels that confirm
 whether the controller has accepted the Laser On and Power On commands,
 indicate error conditions, and signal Ready.  (Coherent Compass-M User
 Interface Signal Monitor in-line with control panel cable.)
<p>
<li><b>Laser diode signal monitor:</b> LCD Digital Panel Meter (DPM) powered
 from the C315M laser head for displaying pump diode control voltage
 (0 to 5.00 V) and pump diode current (two ranges, 0 to 1.999 A, and
 0 to 2.00+ A).  The connections between the laser head and display are
 well isolated so it may be plugged or unplugged live without worrying
 about transients.   By monitoring both the laser
 diode current and laser diode control voltage, the health of the pump diode
 can be easily determined (by a simple calculation) without additional
 measurements.
<p>
<li><b>Laser output power monitor:</b> Readout (same DPM) for laser
 output power (0 to 199.9 mW) with its own dedicated sensor (silicon
 photodiode with ND2 attenuation filter).  Yes, its case is made from
 the end-caps of a defunct HeNe laser head. :)  Since the photo was taken,
 I have also added a switch to select the internal monitor photodiode
 output so that the percent of output power compared to the P6 pot setting
 can be displayed as well as well as the measured output power (0 to 199.9
 percent).
</ul>
<p>
The laser head connector on the custom wiring harness allows for adjustment
of the P6 laser head pot while the laser is powered so that maximum output
power can be easily and quickly adjusted.
<p>
The C315M Laser Head Signal Breakout Adapter could also be installed
in-line with the laser head connector, but its added features would only be
required for really advanced troubleshooting.

<h4><A NAME="strcpsmx">Compass-M Laser Test Procedure</A></h4>

Here are the tests that I suggest for certifying the health of C215M and
C315M laser heads.  If mating one of these laser heads with a specific
Coherent Analog Controller, there may be some benefit to using that
controller for the tests, but it probably doesn't matter all that much.
C215M laser heads can be tested on a C315M controller for determining
their health.  Similar tests would apply to C415M lasers but since they
aren't even claimed to be single frequency (single mode), those tests
are not needed.
<p>
For the basic tests of pump diode health, a DMM will be required with access
to pins 1 (pump diode control voltage), pin 2 (Pump Diode Current, 1 A/V), and
Pin 23 (Common).  A permanent setup with isolation resistors (for protection)
is recommended.
<p>
For the dynamic stability tests, both a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer
(SFPI) and medium to high speed photodiode connected to an oscilloscope are
desirable.  However, either one of these would likely catch most instances of
non-single mode operation or output oscillation.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Power up the laser at the maximum (rated) power setting.
<p>
<li>Check the beam for excessive scatter.  There should be very little.
 If there is noticeable scatter, the output window probably needs cleaning.
 Blow off dust, then use a drop of alcohol and a new piece of lens tissue
 <b>with the laser off or at low power</b>.  At high power, contamination
 may be burnt onto the window!
<p>
<li>Check that the output power is around 50 percent of the rated power during
 initial search.  If not, adjust P6 to put it there.  (I'm not sure P6 will
 reduce power.  If it is too high, turn P6 slightly clockwise, turn off power,
 and start over.)
<p>
<li>While the controller is doing its initial search, measure the pump diode
 control voltage and pump diode current (on pins 1 and 2 of the laser head).
<p>
<li>Once the laser stabilizes (assuming it does stabilize), measure the
 output power.  If it is not between 101 and 106 percent of the rated
 power, adjust P6 to make it so.  Then turn the laser completely off
 using the Power On and Laser On logic signals or remove input power to force
 a complete initialization cycle.
<p>
 If the laser will not stabilize at full power, label it for further
 testing but the maximum power may need to be derated.
<p>
<li>Power the laser back up and measure the pump diode control voltage and
 pump diode current once the laser has stabilized.
<p>
<li>Using the equations found in the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc315i">Typical C315M Pump Diode Current</A>,
 compute Imax and %Imax using both the operating parameters and the
 search parameters (as a check).  They should agree to within 1 or 2
 percent.  If not, R8 or R9 on the laser head PCB is not the usual
 value as described in that section.  Adjust the Imax equation accordingly.
<p>
 Any laser head which runs with %Imax of greater than 90 percent when set
 to 101% of rated power (a bit more if set higher than this) may be
 considered unsuitable for certification as a full power laser.
<p>
<li>Direct the beam to a screen across the room so it's large enough to
 examine closely.  The spot should be nearly perfectly round with a nice
 Gaussian profile.  There should be no lumps. :)  Or use a laser beam
 profiler if you have one available.  Any evidence of multiple (transverse)
 modes will mean the laser is not single frequency, and may be an indication
 of internal problems.
<p>
 Most of these lasers have a low intensity ghost spot, usually above the
 main beam due offset by a few degrees, most likely to the not quite
 perfect AR coating on the output window.  This is normal.
<p>
<li>Direct the (attenuated) beam to the Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer
 (SFPI) and press the Power Set button to initiate a new final ramp-up to full
 power.  Observe the SFPI scope trace <i>for the entire duration of final
 ramp-up</i>.  There should be NO sustained periods of non-single mode
 operation, though some very brief transients may be present as the KTP
 temperature slews back and forth.
<p>
 Constant or nearly continuous spurious modes will mean that the laser is
 essentially useless where a single frequency output is required.
<p>
 Occasional evidence of spurious (ghost) modes at certain power
 levels may not necessarily mean the laser is useless, but could drastically
 limit the allowable power settings and may also mean that the probability of
 stabilizing with a single frequency output may be low enough to be
 annoying, at the very least.
<p>
 If an SFPI is not available, the next test is probably sufficient to catch
 most instances of non-single frequency operation, except for very low level
 additional longitudinal modes, which are generally of little consequence
 except for the most demanding applications.
<p>
<li>Direct the (attenuated) beam to the photodiode.  Observe the scope
 trace <i>for the entire duration of final ramp-up</i>.  There should be
 NO sustained periods of high level oscillation in the 10 Hz to 100 MHz
 frequency range.
<p>
 Occasional evidence of high level oscillation at certain power
 levels may not necessarily mean the laser is useless, but could drastically
 limit the allowable power settings and may also mean that the probability of
 stabilizing with a single frequency output may be low enough to be
 annoying, at the very least.
<p>
<li>Allow the system to run for at least 15 minutes (an hour would be better)
 to confirm that all TECs and temperature control loops are operating
 correctly.  There should be NO evidence of output power instability
 or of Ready going off or flickering.
<p>
 Constant or nearly continuous oscillation will mean that the laser is
 essentially useless where a constant output power is required.
<p>
 Occasional oscillation at certain power levels may not necessarily
 mean the laser is useless, but could drastically limit the allowable power
 settings and may mean that the probability of stabilizing with a clean
 output may be low enough to be annoying, at the very least.

<h3><A NAME="strcpsmr">Repair of Compass-M Laser Heads</A></h3>

Also see the summaries of specific repairs in the sections starting with:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strhos">Reports from Sam's Coherent Compass-M Laser
Hospital</A>.

<h4><A NAME="strcpsmc">Internal Construction of Compass-M Laser Heads</A></h4>

The Compass-M laser heads use a combination of low temperature solder (various
melting temperatures), normal Epoxy, and silver Epoxy to assemble the various
optical and electrical components.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Low temperature solder:</b> All optics assemblies to the ceramic
 substrate or sub-platforms - HR mirror, YAG mount, Brewster plate,
 KTP crystal, OC mirror, cavity "roof", turning mirror 1, beam sampler,
 turning mirror 2, Output lens, output stop(s), output window, and all TECs.
 Cermaic substrate to heat spreader and underlying ceramic plate below it
 at a slightly higher temperature.  There may be 3 or 4 distinct types of
 low temperature solder involved.
<p>
<li><b>High temperature solder:</b> Electrical connections for TECs and
 temperature sensors except the one for the KTP.  It is very difficult to flow
 these joints as the substrate is way too good a conductor of heat.
<p>
<li><b>Normal Epoxy:</b> Optics to mounting plate (glue on top, solder on
 bottom), Brewster plate, beam sampler plate.
<p>
<li><b>Silver Epoxy:</b> KTP temperature sensor and probably KTP crystal to
 its mounting plate.
</ul>
<p>
The laser resonator and optics, and laser diode are on separate platforms
soldered to the baseplate of the metal case.  Aside from a few wires, there
is nothing else between them but photons.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser Diode Assembly:</b> A pair of TECs, one on top of the other,
 forms the foundation.  A plate is soldered to the top TEC and a metal
 upright piece is soldered to that to support the laser diode package
 which is held in place with screws.   A small ceramic substrate holds
 the temperature sensor - a 10K thermistor chip.
<p>
<li><b>Resonator/Optics Assembly:</b> A similar pair of TECs, one on top
 of the other, again forms the foundation.  A pair of ceramic plates the
 same size as the TECs is  soldered to the top of this to act as a spacer.
 Between this and the main ceramic substrate on which the laser is
 constructed, is another thin ceramic plate and then a metal heat spreader,
 both approximately the same size as the laser resonator with cutouts where
 the PermAlaign heaters are located.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsmf">Factory Alignment of Compass-M Laser
 Heads</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Note that even with the rigid construction of the case, some relative movement
between the LD stack and laser/optics stack is unavoidable when stress is
placed on external parts of the laser head, and this may result in power
fluctuations.  It doesn't take much movement to cause a detectable
variation in output power due to a change in pump beam alignment.
On most units, it's no more than a fraction of one percent from force applied
by hand to one side.  However, on some, it may be more severe, perhaps a few
percent.  For constant stress, as would occur when attaching the laser head
to a heatsink, the controller will compensate for any variation that might
occur.  Even if changing the force applied on one side, the power may dip
or rise, but then return to the original value after a few seconds.  However,
I don't know what will happen if the laser were subject to constant
vibrations.
<p>
The upper and lower TECs differ for both the LD and RES stacks.  The top one
has 142 large elements while the lower one has 254 smaller ones.  Thus, for
the same current (where they are in series), the thermal (cooling or heating)
capacity of the lower TEC is about 60 percent higher than for the upper one.
For the LD TEC stack this would make sense since it has to remove both the
heat of the diode and the waste heat generated by the upper TEC since a
TEC is only about 30 percent efficient.  For the RES REC stack, the thermal
load consists of the absorbed power in the YAG rod and the waste heat from
KTP TEC.  The only TEC failures I've seen have been of the lower LD TEC
(probably because it is normally driven much harder than the RES TEC due to
the heat load) resulting in an inability to maintain
a stable LD temperature.  A resistance measurement of a defective
lower TEC will typically show 50 ohms or more after the temperature has
equalized, rather than the very low resistance that is normal.
It's possible to drive only the upper LD TEC if the lower one is electrically
defective since both sets of connections exit the laser head.  With the
baseplate maintained at a low enough temperature, the thermal conductivity
of the bad TEC should be sufficient to allow the laser to run, possibly even
at full power.  However, I don't know if the Coherent controller will
survive if the defective TEC were bypassed with a shorting
jumper.  I had tested a laser head with this problem on my LDC-3900.  It
was capable of the full 100 mW of output power - just barely - with
forced-air cooling of the baseplate headsink.  And this, only because
ambient in my basement/lab is on the order of 18 &deg;C!  Unfortunately,
if the TEC is actually broken in half, there is essentially no way to
run the laser at all as (1) the thermal conductivity of a broken TEC is small
and (2) the alignment of the pump diode will be messed up.  In this
case, it may be best to remove the pump diode entirely (see the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsrd">Replacing the Pump Diode in a Compass-M Laser
Head</A>) and come up with a way to somehow mount it on an external TEC (maybe
upside-down) or use some other means of pumping the laser.

<h4><A NAME="strcpsmi">Getting Inside a C315M or C415M Laser Head</A></h4>

If you have a one of these and it still works, I don't advise going inside the
case at all.  But if your curiosity gets the better of you, limit your
adventure to removing the top cover in as dust-free an environment as you
can find (and only if you are willing to take a significant risk of the laser
never working again).  If it's dead, then there's no problem but appropriate
chants and incantations *MUST* be issued to the gods of dead lasers before
proceeding. :)
<p>
While the laser head is fairly robust and the act of removing the cover
itself won't damage it, accidentally dropping the entire thing on a
concrete floor when it slips out of your hand will likely result in something
that rattles or clunks when shaken, and this is generally not a good thing!
Also, of course, any dust that gets inside will degrade performance and there
is essentially no way of cleaning the critical optics of the laser cavity.
So, keep the cover off for as little time as possible and/or have a
see-through replacement ready.
<p>
<ul>
<li>For the C315M, one quick way to remove the cover
 is to use a model making saw to remove the solder at one corner to a depth
 of about 1/8th inch and then wedge a thin flat blade screwdriver or similar
 tool in the gap (using a drill press or pipe clamp, NOT a hammer!) to
 separate the cover and case.  Once the cover and case
 separate at the corner, it's trivial to pry them apart the rest of the way.
 The type of saw I'm referring to looks like a miniature woodworkers' backsaw
 and has a kerf smaller than 1/64th of an inch.  This is less than the
 thickness of the solder between the cover and case, which will therefore
 not be damaged in the process.  An alternative is to use a utility knife
 at one corner to remove the solder and then carefully prying it up.  (This
 was my method of choice before the revelation of discovering the model
 making saw hiding in one of my tool drawers.)  The saw and pry method is
 definitely easier and quicker though, typically requiring under 1 minute
 without the use of any choice 4 letter words. :)
<p>
<li>For the recessed lids of the C215M and C415M, the saw or utility knife
 won't work.  A small hole can be drilled near one corner to allow the cover
 to be pryed up with an awl or similar thin tool.  The corner of the cover
 might be somewhat abused but there should no damage to the laser head itself.
 If a reasonable amount of prying doesn't work, the next method should - and
 the hole will provide a convenient way of grabbing the cover.
<p>
<li>A small jeweler's torch can be used to melt the solder that seals the
 cover to the case.  Since the special solder melts at a reasonably
 low temperature, the cover should lift off after a few passes around
 the top.  With the entire case sitting on a heatsink, there is little
 danger of accidentally unmounting any of the internal components.  Even
 the heatsink is probably unnecessary.  It might be a good idea to peel off
 the labels first though. :)
<p>
<li>It might also be possible to set the laser on a hot plate and gradually
 raise the temperature until the low temperature solder used to seal the top
 cover to the case melts.  This has been known to work at least with one sample
 of a C315M, and it survived.  However, all internal components are also
 soldered  in place (yes, soldered, not glued or screwed except for the pump
 diode) and should their solder melt, remounting and realignment of some of
 them would be virtually impossible without a total tear-down and access to
 the alien manufacturing line. ;)  I have no idea at what temperature relative
 to the cover the component mounting solder melts - it might even be the same
 temperature with the cavity TEC driven during the final manufacturing step of
 installing the cover to prevent everything else from falling to pieces!
</ul>
<p>
Once the cover is removed, it would be possible to install a Plexiglas
replacement so the interior action would be visible.  In fact, the interior
photos of the C415M were taken with a most excellent Plexiglas cover in
place. :)

<h4><A NAME="strcpsmf">Factory Alignment of Compass-M Laser Heads</A></h4>

After examining the photos, one may be inclined to believe that these lasers
utilize advanced alien technology and would require alien repair people
for service.  But, without the alien warranty information, we don't know where
in the Universe to direct inquiries. :)  They are definitely unconventional
in a variety of respects - at least compared to the typical 100 mW-class
green DPSS laser.  As is obvious from the photos, the cavity itself on the
C315M is not even visible without somewhat destructive disassembly.  (There
is no cavity cover on the C415M.)
<p>
All components inside the laser head that must be precisely aligned are either
mounted via low temperature solder directly to a large ceramic plate, or
soldered to a raised ceramic platform which is itself soldered to the large
ceramic plate.  Resistance heaters under each component enable its solder
to be selectively melted to enable precise positioning, then frozen in place
almost instantly when current is removed.  Access to the terminals for each
heater are via a combination of edge pins (most of which don't exit the
laser head) and/or contact strips which may be probed during the manufacturing
process.  Coherent calls this type of solder blob mounting scheme
"PermAlign" and it is used in some of their other lasers including the Verdi
(up to 10 W green!).
<p>
In the factory during final assembly, there were probably a forest of
computer controlled multiaxis positioners and current driver probes
for adjusting and tweaking alignment.
<p>
However, there would appear to be general problems with the solder sticking
reliably on both the C315M and C415M as some samples I've acquired were dead
due to internal parts falling off the solder blobs.  Examples were the YAG
crystal assembly and Stop 1.  There was even one where the entire "roof"
(cavity cover) of the C315M had broken loose.  With a properly soldered
joint, this shouldn't happen even with significant G forces including those
created if the laser head was dropped onto a hard surface (and there was no
evidence of such trauma on any of these lasers).  Other parts should
fail before the solder.  In most cases, there was obviously less than complete
"wetting" of the two surfaces and only a small area looked like it was even
marginally bonded although the solder did flow and match the contours and
texture of the piece that came loose.  For optics like the OC Mirror where
glue was used to attach them to a sub-platform, the glue tended to fail
rather than the solder.
<p>
CAUTION: Under no circumstances should significant current be applied between
any pins or pads associated with the solder melt heaters unless the selected
component is being held using a multiaxis micropositioner and
the laser is powered so that alignment can be checked.  If this isn't done,
alignment will be lost forever!  Furthermore, unless the component had
already fallen off, the alignment has almost certainly not changed (the
glue and solder that is used is very rigid).  It's unlikely anything will
benefit from tweaking.
<p>
The following applies to the C315M ONLY.  The C415M solder blobs are
controlled in a similar way but the pins differ and there appear to be
many direct connections that would require removing the head cover to access.
<A HREF="c315htr1.jpg">Coherent 315M Laser Head PermAlign Heater
Connections</A> shows the wiring and which areas are affected.
<p>
The gold traces on the ceramic substrate on which the laser is constructed
opposite pins 11, 14, 21, and 26 to 30 (pin 1 is on the right facing the
laser head) are associated with factory alignment of some of the optical
components.  (Note that only those for pins 26 to 30 are connected through
to the outside.)  There are also several gold surface traces on the main
ceramic substrate for the laser and on the cavity cover for other
optical components.  Visual inspection shows these to be attached to
serpentine structures - electric heaters - for melting the low temperature
solder that holds certain crystals and optics in place.  The heaters are
either under the large ceramic substrate on which laser resonator and
output optics are constructed, or under the sub-platforms soldered to the
top of the substrate on which the component sits.  The measured resistance
between pin 28 (common to most of the heaters) and each of the pads or
traces except one ranges from 2.2 to 3 ohms.  The Output Lens area has two
heaters in series so one of them does not connect to pin 28.  Applying about
2 amps to each of these melts the solder in a few seconds.  Removing the
current allows the solder to freeze almost instantly.  Take care not to go
much higher than 2 A as the bonding wires will melt. :(  Here is a summary:
<p>
<b>Main laser substrate:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pad opposite pin 11 to pin 28: Stop 4 (not present on some units).
<li>Pad opposite pin 14 to pin 28: Brewster Plate sub-platform.
<li>Pad opposite pin 21 to pin 27: Output Lens area 2 (closest to output
 aperture).
<li>Pin 27 to pin 28: Output Lens area 1 (furthest from output aperture).
<li>Pin 26 to pin 28: Stop 3 (not present on some units).
<li>Pin 29 to pin 28: Turning Mirror 2.
<li>Pin 30 to pin 28: Turning Mirror 1.
</ul>
<p>
Note that only the traces for pins 26 to 30 are actually connected through to
the outside (via wire bonds from pads on the ceramic substrate
to the connector pins).  There are pads for pins 11, 14, and 22 but no bonding
wires.  Why any outside connections are provided is a mystery
since activating any of the heaters with the cover in place is guaranteed
to destroy the laser.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The outer trace (nearest to substrate edge) on the far side of cavity goes
 to the heater for the solder pad under the HR Mirror and measures about 2.2
 ohms to Pin 28.
<p>
<li>The inner trace on the far side of cavity goes to the heater for the solder
 pad under YAG Mount and measures about 2.2 ohms to Pin 28.
<p>
<li>The second trace from the end in the corner with Turning Mirror 1 goes
 to the heater for the solder pad under the Beam Sampler.
<p>
<li>The third trace from the end in the same area goes to the heater for the
 solder pad under the OC Mirror.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Cavity cover (not in photo):</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pads on either side of Stop 1: Stop 1.
<li>Pads on either side of Stop 2: Stop 2.
<p>
<li>Pads on either side of each visible serpentine structure: Entire cover.
 Applying current to the pair of heaters visible on top of the cavity cover
 should enable the entire cover to be lifted off as the heat flows from the
 ceramic down through the metal side pieces to the low temperature solder
 holding it to the substrate.  I would imagine that both stops fall off as
 well but these should have already been removed if the roof is being
 taken off.
</ul>
<p>
The ceramic of the laser substrate and cavity cover is highly heat conducting
- it's very difficult to use a modest power (e.g. Weller) soldering iron to
melt even the low temperature solder unless very near the tip of the iron.
It's almost impossible to melt normal solder (used for those components like
the temperature sensors that aren't designed to be movable).  The heaters have
no trouble because they are in immediate proximity on the opposite side of
the ceramic from the solder blob involved.  (CAUTION: There may be
BeO involved - I do not know.  To  be safe, do NOT attempt to file
or grind any of the ceramic material!)
<p>
Taking advantage of this solder melt technology would seem to be the best
way of allowing optics to be aligned.  If there is enough solder already
present, then it can just be reflowed.  But if additional solder is needed,
use low temperature (e.g., 93 &deg;C) solder and some liquid flux.
However, I do not know for how long the current can be applied before
bad things happen to nearby components.  For example, leaving the current
on long enough to melt the solder under the massive Nd:YAG Assembly may
result in the HR mirror falling off as well.  It's definitely a quick and
easy way to remove any of the other optical components.  However, thus far,
I've been using glue to reinstall components that may require significant
time to align.  I do intend to try it out for the Brewster plate, and for
the OC mirror if that is needed.

<h4><A NAME="strrrcmc">Replacing or Reinstalling Compass-M Laser Head
 Components</A></h4>

A serious rattle when shaken is a tip-off that something is loose inside!
C315M heads should not make any sound when shaken.  C415M heads apparently
have a PCB insulator or something else outside the cavity that isn't screwed
down and may make some noise if the head is shaken - this is normal.
<p>
I've seen various C315M laser heads where one or more of the major optics had
broken off.  There was even one where the TECs supporting the entire optics
platform had broken in half.  Needless to say, that one was hopeless.  There
was another where just the LD and its TEC had become detached.  And another
where the entire optics platform had come loose from the baseplate but
was otherwise mostly intact (the Beam Sampler and laser diode mounting
plate had also become detached).  It did produce a green beam just powering
the laser diode once the parts were reinstalled.  But without temperature
control, it wasn't very strong or stable.
I've seen the vanadate crystal break loose on a C415M head.
<p>
The most common are where a single component has broken loose.
<p>
If these lasers heads are dropped (argggggh!!!) or bumped, or possibly
for no reason at all, one or more of the internal optics or other parts may
pop off.  Major damage like the entire optics platform coming free is almost
certainly either from being dropped, or possibly melting of some of the low
temperature solder holding things together should a TEC or its control
loop fail (though I have no proof of this).
<p>
Realistically, unless a miracle occurs, the only chance of relatively
easy repair will be with components <i>outside</i> the actual laser cavity -
beyond the output mirror (e.g., not under the roof in the C315M).  Initial
alignment isn't needed since there will be a green beam when the pump diode is
powered.  A 6-axis micropositioner is highly desirable but not essential
for most of these.  The major exception is Turning Mirror 1 (see below)
although even that can probably be done without one.
<p>
The following applies directly to the C315M and C415M.  I assume it also
applies to the C215M but haven't confirmed this.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsmi">Getting Inside a C315M or
C415M Laser Head</A> for access to the interior.  After opening the laser,
inspect for damage to optical components as well as the numerous wire bonds
connecting the exterior pins to the ceramic laser substrate, and between
various components like the photodiode sensor.  These are very fragile
and likely aluminum wires which can't be soldered back in place even if a
soldering iron with a super fine tip is available.  Removing the remains of
the bonding wire and installing a thin jumper wire is the only practical
repair option.
<p>
One of the lasers I opened had about 50 percent of the
bonding wires between the input pins and ceramic substrate broken, possibly
due to the two optics (Turning Mirror 1 and Output Lens) that were bouncing
around inside.  Remarkably, the optics were relatively undamaged.  I
jumpered to the pins using fine wire and solder.  The optics, especially
those inside the cavity that can't be cleaned, must be protected from
solder smoke (i.e., vaporized rosin) when doing any soldering in the laser.
Soldering to the remnants of the bonding wires isn't possible because they
are aluminum.  I then reinstalled the optics using
the procedures described below.  That laser appears fine except that the
lower LD TEC has a high resistance, possibly the original problem that
caused it to be taken out of service.  Bypassing the defective TEC allows
the laser to operate producing about 35 mW at 1.5 A pump current without
any optimization of LD, KTP, and RES temperatures.  Since the LD TEC now
has a lower voltage drop, I haven't attempted to use the Coherent Analog
Controller, just the LDC-3900.  It would probably be fine but I'm not
willing to risk damage to the controller.
<p>
When replacing any component prior to Turning Mirror 2, the laser head will
have to be powered by a laser diode driver, not the Coherent Analog
Controller.  This is due to the fact that for these components, the output
of the photosensor is affected and will totally confuse the controller, likely
causing it to shut off.  (For components beyond the photosensor, the Analog
Controller can be used.)  It is only necessary to drive the laser diode at
relatively low current (just above green threshold) for most of these
procedures.  However, temperature control is still necessary if powering
it for more than a minute or so to prevent overheating, but with care,
this can be open loop if no TEC controller is available.
<p>
In most cases, the component will fit on the original mounting surface
where the break occurred relatively close to the proper position.  However,
this alone probably won't be sufficient for acceptable alignment.  Thus,
active alignment while powered will be needed.
<p>
Some means of rigidly holding the component will have to be provided if using
a micropositioner.  Both the micropositioner and laser head should be mounted
so they can't move with respect to each other.  Even if positioning by hand,
an extension "handle" may be desirable to enable more more precise
adjustment.  The holder or handle can be attached either with glue or
a mechanical gripper.  Suitable glues include windshield sealer or Duco
Cement(tm), or a very small dab of 5 minute Epoxy or UV cure adhesive.
A gripper can be constructed from a material like aluminum or plastic.
It can either be spring loaded or use a screw for tightening its grip.
<p>
However, care must be taken with all these approaches to assure that only
minimal stress is applied when releasing the glue or grip so as not to
disturb the bond permanently mounting the component after the repair is
complete.
<p>
My custom built rig consists of a 3 degree of freedom tilt/rotation
platform mounted on a 3-axis XYZ platform.  See <A HREF="cpsmapt1.jpg">Six-Axis
Alignment Platform for Coherent Compass-M Lasers</A>.  The XYZ platform
is a castoff since it has a non-standard hole pattern and won't mount
on a normal optical breadboard.  The baseplate is a 3/8" thick piece
of anodized aluminum from some long defunct laser system, model
unknown.  My only concession to real optics breadboard widgetry is the
tilt/rotation platform, which is a Newport PO46N-50 on extended loan
since the other microprositioners I have don't include the needed
rotate adjustment.  The gripper was made from a small alligator clip
soldered to a brass screw for mounting.  Spring force holds the optic
but an 0-80 screw which can be tightened to open the jaws and release
its grip.  The jaws were reformed and then padded with heat-shrink tubing
to fit the optic.  The gripper is mounted on some bits of aluminum
chassis hardware which provide additional degrees of freedom for
initial setup.  The inset shows a closeup of the gripper holding
the output lens during final alignment with only the pump diode and its
TEC being driven.  This same gripper will work for any of the optics.
It was quite easy to reinstall the Turning Mirror 1 and Output Lens in
a C315M head that must have been dropped.  Note the temperature readout
of the LDC-3900 - 42.35 &deg;C.  The actual temperature is around 20 &deg;C but
the 10K ohm pullup resistor on the laser head PCB is in parallel
with the sensor so the readout is screwed up.  Temperature regulation works
fine but it would be possible to determine C1/C2/C3 parameters for
the "Steinhart-Hart Equation" used by the TEC controller to correct this.
<p>
<b>Replacing components outside the laser cavity:</b>
<p>
Here are notes for each of the components outside the laser cavity (not
under the "roof" of the C315M).  These do not require super precise
alignment:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser Diode Mounting Plate:</b> DO NOT loosen laser diode mounting
 screws!  DO NOT scrape off solder!  Inspect green-blocking (red) filter
 for damage.  Remove if badly scratched or broken (which is likely).  Inspect
 end of GRIN lens for scratches or damage.  If central area is in good
 condition, glue plate using a very thin layer of conductive silver Epoxy
 rather than solder.  Power up and check and tweak horizontal position of
 diode before Epoxy cures.  CAUTION: Positive side of laser diode is connected
 to controller via this joint.  It is probably best to provide an alternative
 path while adjustments are made.
<p>
<li><b>Stop 2:</b> Position so beam passes cleanly through without visible
 ghost beams.  (Note: Laser operation including beam quality appears to
 be unaffected by a total lack of this part.  So, replacement may not even
 be needed.  However, output power adjustment will probably be changed due
 to the greater amount of scattered green and IR light hitting the
 photodiode.)
<p>
<li><b>Turning Mirror 1:</b> Adjust so beam passes cleanly through output
 stop(s) and hits near the center of the photodiode chip.  This is likely the
 most difficult part outside of the laser cavity to align and will almost
 certainly require the micropositioner because (1) it is tucked in a corner
 and is difficult to manipulate by hand even if attached to a "handle", and
 (2) the response of the beam to its movement bouncing off of Turning Mirror 2
 is very sensitive and somewhat counterintuitive.
<p>
<li><b>Beam Sampler:</b> If just the angled plate came off, clean it and then
 glue it back in position.  If the entire assembly came off, first solder
 fine wires to the two gold pads taking care not to break the bonding wires
 to the photodiode chip.  Then, glue the assembly back into position so that
 the beam hits near the center of the photodiode chip.  Finally, solder the
 two wires to the corresponding gold traces on the ceramic substrate.
<p>
<li><b>Turning Mirror 2:</b> Adjust so beam passes cleanly through output
 stop(s).  I have done this one by hand.
<p>
<li><b>Output Lens:</b> Adjust so beam passes cleanly through output
 stop(s) and is aligned with optical axis of laser (if possible).  This
 is probably the least critical of all the optics.
<p>
<li><b>Output Stop:</b> Adjust so beam passes cleanly through its center.
 If there is something other than a plate with a hole, position to eliminate
 any ghost beams.
<p>
<li><b>Output Aperture:</b> Inspect and clean both surfaces if necessary.
 Test with full power beam to assure that there is little or no scatter.
 This is the one part that can be replaced without opening the laser!  But
 put a piece of tape over the hole until the part is replaced to keep the
 interior clean.
</ul>
<p>
Once the proper position of the component has been determined, unless
otherwise noted, use a thin layer of 5 minute Epoxy or UV cure adhesive
(if to sub-platform) or solder melt (if to substrate) to secure it
permanently.  Since the alignment of these components is not nearly
as critical as with optics like resonator mirrors inside the laser
cavity, the slight change during curing shouldn't
affect alignment significantly.  However, it would also be possible to take
advantage of the solder melt technology to fine tune the alignment at a
later time if needed.  Glue can also be used in place of solder melt
between the sub-platform and substrate but this may preclude future
alignment using the solder melt technology.
<p>
Where two or more components have fallen off, start with the one closest
to the laser cavity.  If both turning mirrors have fallen off, they will
have to be aligned at the same time for best output pointing accuracy
and beam quality.
<p>
Once the glue has cured, temporarily set the lid in place and confirm that the
laser still operates normally. Then, either tape it all around, fasten
it with Epoxy or low temperature solder, or replace the metal lid with
a see-through Plexiglas cover.
<p>
Since the integrity of the laser cavity isn't compromised by a failure of
components outside the cavity, spec'd performance should be achievable
once the repairs are made.  With a bit of experience, an hour start to
finish is reasonable if no micropositioner is required.  And it is
well worth the effort.
<p>
<b>Replacing components inside the laser cavity:</b>
<p>
For the C315M, access to the components under the "roof" will be required.
(The C415M head has no roof.  I don't know about the C215M.)  To remove
the roof, use a soldering iron to heat it near the solder attaching it
to the substrate.  Go along both sides, back and forth.  Eventually,
the entire roof will become hot enough so it can be removed, hopefully
without falling apart entirely.  Take care not to smash the green-blocking
(red) filter between the pump diode and HR mirror.  It is very fragile.
The laser will work without the filter but stability might be reduced.
If a component fell off under the roof, it may have damaged itself
and other components while bouncing around.  So, inspect for scratches,
cracks, and dings on the YAG and KTP crystals, mirrors, and Brewster plate.
<p>
Here are some notes on replacing specific components:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>HR Mirror:</b> Must use 6-axis micropositioner.  Perform initial
 alignment using HeNe laser (see the next section).  Then adjust for
 maximum green light and best beam quality.  Use low shrink rigid adhesive
 (optic to sub-platform) or solder melt (sub-platform to substrate).
<p>
<li><b>Nd:YAG Assembly:</b> Replacement is likely possible without
 precise alignment.  Just line it up as best as possible by eye with
 the original mounting pad.  Use Epoxy or solder melt to substrate.
<p>
<li><b>Brewster Plate:</b> Glue back flush on angled mount using 5 minute
 Epoxy or UV cure adhesive.
<p>
<li><b>Stop 1:</b> The use of at least a 3-axis positioner is recommended
 but it may be possible to do this by hand.  Align for maximum green light
 and clean beam.  Use 5 minute Epoxy or solder melt.
<p>
<li><b>KTP:</b> Must use 6-axis micropositioner.  Adjust for maximum green
 light and best beam quality.  Use silver Epoxy to attach the KTP or KTP
 on its sub-platform to the TEC.  See the next section for alignment procedure.
<p>
<li><b>KTP TEC:</b> It appears to be virtually impossible to remove the KTP
 assembly from the ceramic substrate non-destructively on the intact laser.
 Even a Weller soldering gun was incapable of heating the bottom of a
 destroyed KTP TEC enough to loosen it.  This is likely due to the fact
 that in addition to the high heat conductivity of the ceramic, there is
 a metal heat spreader running under the resonator portion of the laser.
 The only way I was able to finally remove it was to put the entire assembly
 on a hot plate.  This is obviously not a suitable method if the alignment
 of any other optical components matters since they will fall off before
 the KTP TEC!
<p>
<li><b>OC Mirror:</b> Must use 6-axis micropositioner.  See the next section.
 Use low shrink rigid adhesive (optic to sub-platform) or solder melt
 (sub-platform to substrate).
</ul>
<p>
Note that any replacement of components inside the laser cavity other
than Stop 1 is likely to alter the optimal temperature set-points, possibly
dramatically.  Therefore, the laser may not stablize and achieve spec'd
output power using Coherent Analog Controller even if everything is in
tip top shapte.  Adjustment of the head PCB pots may be needed.  While
this is possible in principle, working backwards from settings determined
using something like the ILX Lightwave LDC-3900 laser diode controller,
it's a additional complication.
<p>
I'd say that replacing any components inside the laser cavity other than
Stop 1 is probably not justified if the objective is simply to have a
working laser.  Full spec C315M heads, at least, are readily available
and very reasonably priced nowadays ($300 or less, Winter 2004).  Figure
on spending several hours to replace something like the OC mirror even
if the required micropositioner setup already exists.  Having said that...

<h4><A NAME="strrrcmo">Reinstalling the OC Mirror in a Compass-M Laser
 Head</A></h4>

My next project was to try to reinstall the OC Mirror in yet another abused
C315M laser head.  I originally estimated the probability of success at about
25 percent, mostly since I didn't know whether everything else was in good
condition and the pump diode may be weak.  This was to be a "is this
possible" project, so the amount of time and effort spent on it was not
a major concern.  I was hoping to get away
without requiring a HeNe laser for initial alignment but gave up and
(possibly prematurely) and set one up.  It did give me a good excuse to
dump my wooden alignment platform and fabricate a metal one with more
precise adjustment screws.
<p>
A procedure basically similar to the one below should work for the HR mirror.
However, this will be much more difficult for several reasons.  See the next
section.  The Brewster plate can just be reglued taking care that it is flush
with its angled mounting bracket.  However, the KTP requires temperature
control during final alignment (described below).
<p>
The objective of the initial alignment was to get the orientation of the
OC mirror close enough so that the pan and tilt range of the Newport stage
(see the previous section) would include the lasing condition.  Install the
OC mirror on the gripper and adjust is as squarely as possible to the C315M's
optical axis leaving enough adjustment range both ways in pan and tilt.
<p>
Both of the OC mirror surfaces appear to be planar.  The one with the more
obvious coating mask faces into the cavity.  (If you're not sure which one is
which, you'll have to try both ways and pick the one with a higher output
power for a given pump current.  It may lase both ways but going through
the AR coating for green - not IR - will reduce power, probably dramatically.)
<p>
Since the mirror coatings of the OC are nearly transparent to the red HeNe
laser, it can be left in place for all steps of the alignment procedure.  There
is just enough reflection to do the last step of initial alignment -
centering the reflected beam in the Output Stop.
<p>
<ol>
<li>The idea is to set up the alignment laser so its beam shoots cleanly
 through output aperture and hits the center of the GRIN lens of the pump
 diode (via the KTP and YAG rod).  This is identical to the path the normal
 C315M beam (IR and green) needs to take.  With the "roof" removed, it's just
 barely possible to see where the beam hits on the GRIN lens.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>For horizontal adjustments, angular movement of the beam at the laser
  cavity remains parallel with the alignment beam since the pair of turning
  mirrors effectively form part of a corner cube.
<p>
 <li>For vertical adjustments, the angular movement of the beam at the
  laser cavity moves in the opposite direction (e.g., diverges from
  the alignment beam).
  </ul>
<p>
 This sounds trickier than it really is but take your time.  The closer the
 initial alignment is, the more likely that subsequent steps will be easier
 to accomplish.
<p>
<li>Once the centering is done,  Use a tiny sliver of paper just in
 front of the Output Stop as a screen to "probe" for the reflected
 red beam returned from the OC mirror via the two turning mirrors.  It's
 quite weak but its the only of several reflections that will move when
 the OC mirror is wiggled via the Newport stage.  With some luck, it
 won't be hard to locate.  Center it as best as possible in the Output
 Stop hole.  It might be possible to actually see it at the HeNe
 laser's aperture as well.
<p>
<li>Turn off the alignment laser and power up the C315M's laser diode
 at well above threshold (I used 1.5 A) with
 cooling so you don't have to worry about something melting if this takes
 longer than expected.  If the optimal temperatures for the diode is
 known, use that since it will reduce the threshold for green light.
 If not, just use 20 &deg;C.  If the optimal temperatures for the KTP
 and RES are known, it's best to have those controlled as well for the
 same reason.
<p>
<li>Rock the OC mirror via the pan adjustment while very very slowly
 adjusting the tilt adjustment searching for the lasing orientation.
 Assuming everything else is undamaged, this shouldn't be that difficult
 to locate as I later found.  Initially, it turned out to be impossible
 for my laser because of other problems (see below).
<p>
<li>Once there is some green light, fine tune the pan and tilt adjustments
 for maximum green power and clean circular beam profile while also
 homing in on the same mounting location as was originally used before
 the OC mirror fell off.  Note that any movement of the mirror will
 result in some power fluctuations due to the change in cavity length
 relative to the cavity modes and likely etalon effect of the KTP.
 This variation is much more sensitive than the mirror alignment so just
 strive for the best average orientation.
<p>
<li>Carefully raise the OC mirror using the Y adjustment so some low-shrink
 adhesive can be applied.  Then, lower the OC mirror to seat it
 in the adhesive.  If using the solder blob melt technique to do the
 final alignment, the accuracy at this point isn't super critical as
 long as it is reasonably close.  So, if the glue does change its shape
 a bit, it's not disaster.  Otherwise, keep fine tuning as the glue
 cures to assure an optimal outcome.
</ol>
<p>
For my laser, it was at first impossible to get <i>any</i> green lasing.
I was at the point of giving up but decided to inspect the KTP since there
was a bright point of red light (from the alignment laser) on one surface.
At first I thought it was just a spec of dust.  But close examination revealed
a ding or crack in the surface.  And, it was large enough that part of
the intracavity could indeed have been blocked.  No wonder there was
no green light!  I don't know if the damage was caused by the OC mirror
bouncing around inside the cavity or if the damage was the cause of
the laser being removed from service originally.
<p>
So, with the tip of my trusty Weller soldering iron heating the solder
holding the KTP crystal on its ceramic carrier to the TEC, I used a pair
of tweezers to lift it free.  Once the damaged KTP was no longer in the way,
there was almost immediate IR lasing, made visible with an IR detector card
placed between the OC mirror and Turning Mirror 1.  I hadn't even attempted
to readjust the alignment using the HeNe laser.  It was very easy to
get a nice clean beam IR.  And, poking a KTP crystal from a Uniphase uGreen
laser into the intracavity beam resulted in immediate significant green
light even though its orientation was far from optimal.  I also tried a
traditional 2x2x5 mm AR coated KTP crystal, and this also worked like a
charm without careful alignment.
<p>
I removed the KTP from a certifiably dead C315M head and after careful
cleaning, was able to obtain green light when it was just placed in
position.  Since the cross-section of the C315M KTP is only about 1x1
mm, it is a bit more difficult to orient it.  Also, the optimal orientation
in the C315M isn't nearly parallel to the optical axis of the laser but
at a 5 or 10 degree angle.  One thing is obvious:
Reasonably precise alignment of the KTP will be required for best results.
I don't know if best results can be achieved if this is done after the
OC mirror is glued in place but since I only have a single adjustable
gripper setup, there will be no choice.  That may be possible since the
OC mirror is either planar or very close so adjustment of the KTP
orientation would not significantly affect cavity alignment.  In fact,
in the way of confirmation, the angle of the KTP can varied with
little effect on cavity alignment - the mirror orientation for best
lasing doesn't change - though of course, the amount of green light
does vary due to changes in phase matching.
<p>
Nect, I glued the OC mirror with slow setting Epoxy for maximum rigidity
and strength.  This should survive if further alignment is needed using the
solder blob melt technique.  Since there was no practical way of monitoring
the IR power, I did the gluing with the KTP in place and aligned for
maximum green.  After completely curing, the alignment doesn't seem to
have changed significantly.
<p>
Next I used the same positioner to align the KTP for maximum green
output.  This is complicated by the desire to be able to find the optimum
settings for the LD, RES, and KTP temperature.  With the KTP in the jaws
of the gripper and not in contact with the TEC, this obviously won't work.
So, what I did rough alignment without worrying about the
KTP temperature, then lifted the KTP so some silver Epoxy could be added,
and did final alignment with the silver Epoxy providing a low thermal
resistance path to the TEC.  Any change to KTP alignment also affects
the optimal settings of all the temperatures so optimizing alignment was
somewhat frustrating and I'm sure it's not quite the best.  Fortunately,
this isn't as critical as mirror alignment and can be partially compensated
with the temperature settings.  In the end, the output power was about as
good as before gluing both the OC and KTP.
<p>
I kind of doubt being able to achieve total success in terms of full output
power.  On the LDC-3900, it's doing about 10 mW at 1.5 A of pump current.  This
would mean that 20 or 30 mW rather than 100 mW may be the maximum at the
diode current limit.  The beam is nice TEM00 with minimal scatter but
part of the problem may be contamination or slight damage on any or all
of 8 intracavity optics surfaces.  I've attempted to clean those that are
accessible but there are 2 - the back of the YAG rod and the HR mirror - that
can't be reached.  The health of the pump diode is also not known.
<p>
Speaking of cleaning: Just having the box open allows enough dust to land
on the optics that output power declines with time.  This is most of a problem
with the outer surface of the Brewster plate (which can easily be dusted
off with a cotton swab) but also affects the other optics (which have to
be cleaned using a solvent with the "drop and drag" technique.
<p>
Rather than replacing the "roof", which would be a pain to align and glue,
I made a little opaque cover for the photosensor to block most of the light
coming in from above, and put some strips of black tape on the cover so
its reflectance would be reduced.  On the Coherent Analog Controller, it
behaves more or less normally except for a some quirks.  For one thing,
there are certain ranges of the P6 pot where the output will not stabilize
at the correct value, at least not consistently.  This may be due to the
laser tending to jump from around 18 mW to something much higher, rather
than increasing smoothly and monitonically with increasing pump power.
There is also a range of pump power where the output tends to decrease.
This may be due to a damaged pump diode, or simply to the way the modes and
temperatures of the LD, KTP, and RES interact.  So, in the "ramp-up phase"
following power-on or a new power setting, as the controller ramps up pump
power, the output jumps through the narrow error window of acceptable power.
The controller then seems to be confused and either doesn't realize the power
is too high, or is never able to bring the power back down enough, possibly
because it never reduces pump power during the "ramp=up
phase" of the procedure.  And, what it eventually does is attempt to remedy
the situation by <i>increasing</i> pump current still further.  I'm also
not sure if it recognizes the current limit setting for the pump diode
and wasn't about to find out that it didn't so I never let the current
go higher than 2.5 A, which was already above the current engraved on
the pump diode for this laser head 2.37 A!  (Though this discrepancy could
have been measurement error.)
<p>
When it did stabilize, output power was as high as 36 mW at 2.3 A, and 21 mW
at 2 A.  So, it could still be useful as a C315M-20.

<h4><A NAME="strrrcmh">Reinstalling the HR Mirror in a Compass-M Laser Head</A>
 Head</A></h4>

While this is in principle basically the same as replacing the OC mirror,
as a practical matter it will be much more difficult to achieve initial
alignment and to retain alignment during the final gluing.  There are
several reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on what your micropositioner uses for a gripper, a "handle" of
 some sort may need to be attached to the HR mirror so it can be positioned
 in between the YAG rod and GRIN lens without hitting something.
<p>
<li>The HR mirror is curved.  Thus, the reflection of any alignment laser
 beam back from it will be spread out and harder to see than a small spot.
 All of the intermediate surfaces will make interpreting the reflections
 a challenge.  It may not make it back beyond the KTP in any useful form.
<p>
 The correct reflection will move in the same direction as the mirror.  The
 reflection that goes through the mirror and bounces off its flat surface
 will look similar but will move in the opposite direction.
<p>
<li>The space for movement of the HR mirror during alignment is very limited
 compared to the wide open area around the OC mirror.  Thus, quite precise
 initial alignment will be needed to even get close.
<p>
<li>After lasing is achieved and the strongest nicest beam is obtain (I'll
 be an optimist!), the mirror can't simply be moved in one linear axis (up
 and down) for gluing as with the OC mirror.  Alignment will be  lost unless
 it was already in the gluing position.  At least two, possibly three or
 more degrees of freedom of the micropositioner will need to be controlled
 to maintain alignment AND not crash into something.  And this  will take
 time.
<p>
<li>Once the HR mirror is in between the YAG rod end and the GRIN lens,
 there's no way to clean it so the surfaces must be spotless from the
 start of alignment.  Unless, that is, YAG rod assembly is removed as I
 did below..
</ul>
<p>
I'm attempting replace the HR mirror on a C315M laser head that has lost
the entire KTP assembly including the TEC and temperature sensor.  So, mirror
alignment will be performed with the IR beam.  Then, a platform with a normal
AR coated 2x2x5mm KTP crystal will be installed at least for testing.
However, from preliminary experiments, it's already clear that this won't
be nearly as much fun as for the OC mirror.
<p>
After spending a fair amount of time trying to do this in the same manner
as the OC mirror, I concluded that going in via the output aperture was
way too confusing.  So, I removed Turning Mirror 1 by melting its solder
blob (which worked really well!) and then drilled a small hole through the case
wall so the alignment beam could enter directly.  Now the reflection could
at least be located and adjustments to the alignment laser and to the HR
mirror were easier to interpret.  However, available space for adjustment
of the HR mirror is way too small without a ganiometer-type positioner which
would put the center of rotation at the mirror.  So, I then removed the
Nd:YAG Assembly by melting its solder blob (which also worked really well!).
Now, there is plenty of space for adjustment.  I then removed the Brewster plate
assembly in a similar manner since I was always suspect of its cleanliness
given the difficulty in getting underneath for cleaning.  Finally, after
removing most of the C315M's organs, not only was it easier to see the
reflected alignment beam, but IR lasing was achieved almost immediately
once the YAG assembly was placed in position.  Though, I do wonder if I
had just been missing it before as the IR transmission through the OC
mirror was rather weak.  I was only convinced lasing was for real by
placing a 2x2x5mm KTP crystal inside the cavity and getting some green
light.  Not a whole lot but at least it was lasing.
<p>
I have now aligned and glued the HR mirror, but was not able to use the
solder melt technique because there wasn't enough solder remaining (I
had cleaned both surfaces to get a closer fit).  Just adding low temperature
solder wasn't sufficient; flux is likely needed.  So, I used slow curing
Epoxy.  I figure that if this doesn't retain alignment over time, I <i>can</i>
use the solder melt technique on the OC mirror to touch it up.  The OC mirror
has its full complement of pristine solder in place.  However, so far -
several days later - the alignment is holding.
<p>
As I proceed with this exercise, it's becoming more and more obvious that
cleaning of the optics is the biggest pain since they are so small and in
cramped quarters.  But as we all know, a 10:1 difference in output power
can be due to a barely noticeable film of contamination on a single surface!
And, there are 8 surfaces in all for this laser!
<p>
Next will be to position the Brewster plate and secure it using the solder
melt.  Then, to meticulously clean the HR mirror and adjacent YAG rod end
and secure the YAG Assembly with Epoxy - I don't want to heat the area of
the HR mirror since this might throw its alignment off.  Or, maybe try
a piece of AR/AR vanadate or something more exotic in place of the YAG
rod as an experiment. :)

<h4><A NAME="strcpsrd">Replacing the Pump Diode in a Compass-M Laser
 Head</A></h4>

The following applies directly to the C315M but should also be applicable
to the C415M and C215M with minor modifications.
<p>
This procedure should more properly be called "swapping" the pump
diode since I don't know of a source for replacements in the cute
gold plated box. :)  (However, it might be possible to just replace the
C-mount style laser diode inside the cute gold plated box but the cover
with the GRIN lens would have to be carefully aligned before gluing
it back in place.)  The most likely situation would be where two
laser heads are available - one with a damaged resonator
and the other with a bad diode.  The following should be done under
the cleanest conditions possible.  A clean room or glove box would be
ideal but at least don't do it in a dusty basement. :)  ESD precautions
should be followed.
<p>
Although I have not succeeded in using the complete procedure below, I have
swapped the diode boxes in a C315M with no trouble in achieving alignment.
Whether this works in all cases though is not known.  It's possible that
the GRIN lens is not guaranteed to have the same alignment to the actual
diode so the beam comes out precisely perpendicular in all cases.  That
would be bad.
<p>
CAUTION: The more serious problem is accomplishing this transplant without
collateral damage.  Vibrations from the drilling, filing, or grinding may
result in internal parts falling off.  The clearances are tight between
the diode and green-blocking (red) filter so that it is easily smashed
which may pop off the HR mirror behind it and there is no room to install
a shield thicker than a piece of paper.  If you drill too deeply, the hex
heads of the diode mounting screws will be damaged requiring that they
be drilled out.  And, if doing this, the diode may be pushed in resulting
in the the smashing described above.  My first attempt resulted in all of
these problems rendering the C315M head only good for parts.  So, only
attempt the following as an absolute last resort!
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the lids on both laser heads.  This is most easily done by using
 a model makering saw to slice the solder between the lid and side to a
 depth of 1/16" or so.  Then, carefully wedge a penknife blade or thin
 flat screwdriver blade between the lid and case and pry it off.  Once
 the corner comes free, the remainder will follow easily.
 See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsmi">Getting Inside a C315M
 or C415M Laser Head</A> for additional options.
<p>
<li>Label the good and bad diodes so they won't get mixed up.  Put scribe
 marks on the mounting bracket at the corners of the diode in the laser which
 is to get the replacement diode.  These will serve as starting points for
 initial alignment.  Also record the values of the threshold, operating, and
 maximum current marked on the replacement diode if legible.  Carefully
 push the socket off of the diode's negative pin.
<p>
<li><b>Technique 1:</b> For each laser head, locate the position on the
 <i>outside</i> of the case for the two cap screws that fasten the pump diode.
 On the C315M, the hidden screw is approximately 3/8" below and
 5/8" to the right of the one that's visible viewed from the
 front of the laser head.  The visible screw is just at
 the edge of the mount for the output window so the mount may have to be
 removed to be able to drill that hole.  This can most easily be done by
 going around its edge with a hot soldering iron until it falls off.
 Mount the laser head in a drill-press vice to reduce the possibility
 of vibration causing internal parts to fall off.  Drill 3/16" holes in
 the side of the case to expose the screw heads.  Take care to minimize
 vibrations and drill just through the case wall since there isn't much
 clearance inside.  Any pressure on the diode mounting plate will likely
 cause it to break free resulting in the filter and HR mirror being
 destroyed.  Remove burrs as best as possible from the holes and
 shake out any debris that may have gotten inside.
 A straight reemer is best for the final widening of the holes.\
<p>
 <b>Technique 2:</b> For each laser head, use a high speed rotary tool (e.g.,
 Dremel) with a cutoff wheel to slice away the front plate of the laser head
 case near the sides and bottom.  This may result in much lower vibration
 and less risk of damaging internal components during the initial part of
 the surgery.  Holes can then be drilled in the plates off-line so that
 future diode replacement would only require removing tape from the holes
 and the use of a hex wrench.  After the transplant is completed, the plates
 can be easily re-installed with shims and adhesive.
<p>
 <b>Technique 3:</b> For each laser head, remove the entire laser assembly
 by heating the laser head on a hot plate just until the solder holding it
 to the baseplate melts and then lift it out.  Of course, all the external
 connections will need to be reattached when surgery is complete but this
 eliminates any issues of vibration trauma.  No further details on this
 procedure are given. :)
<p>
<li>Insert a folded piece of lens tissue between the diode's GRIN lens and the
 red filter plate to protect them from accidental contact.
<p>
<li>While holding the diode box to prevent the GRIN lens from contacting the
 red filter plate, use a hex wrench to remove the screws and slide the diode
 box straight up and out of the laser head.  The filter plate is very thin and
 fragile so take care not to apply any pressure to it.
<p>
<li>Attaching a small clamp to the good diode box or gluing a small post to it
 to use as a handle may make it easier to adjust position for alignment.  This
 doesn't require a fancy Newport stage - moving it around by hand should be
 adequate.
<p>
<li>Check the condition of the red filter plate and GRIN lens; clean them if
 necessary.  If the filter is damaged in the critical central area, break
 the remains free.  The laser will operate without it though I don't know
 how stability will be affected.
<p>
<li>Carefully slide the replacement pump diode into position and fasten
 it using two cap screws and lock washers only snug enough to hold position
 and adjust it so the scribe marks are just visible.  Push the socket for
 the negative connection back in place.
<p>
<li>Power up the pump diode to a current that should put the laser head
 over threshold.  For most C315Ms, this is about 1 A.  Drive the pump diode
 TEC to keep the diode temperature below 25 &deg;C.  If you can measure the
 pump diode wavelength, adjust the TEC current for 808 to 810 nm.  Unless
 the case TEC is also powered, don't run like this for more than a few minutes
 or if the diode case increases significantly in temperature.
<p>
<li>Using your "handle", move the pump diode around until there is some
 green light and optimize its position for maximum output and best beam
 shape.  Tighten the screws alternating in small increments.  Power down.
<p>
<li>Replace the lid on the repaired laser head using tape along the edges
 at least for now.  Put a couple of pieces of tape or stickers over the
 screw access holes as well and/or replace the front plate depending on
 which technique was used.
<p>
<li>Adjust the pot settings on the repaired C315M laser head for pump diode
 current limit (P1) and pump diode temperature (P2) to match the settings on
 the head from which the replacement pump diode was taken.  An approach that
 should work is to measure the pot resistances on the donor head with a
 multimeter and adjust the pots on the recipient head to match.  Alternatively,
 apply +5 VDC to both heads and adjust the P1 and P2 pots on the recipient
 head so their output voltages match that of the donor.
<p>
<li>Test the repaired head on the Coherent Analog Controller.  Monitor the
 pump diode current and abort if it comes anywhere near the current limit.
 Determine what's wrong!  Some fine alignment may be needed.  Diode current
 shouldn't be much above the operating current marked on the diode box if it
 is new.  If high mileage, it could be closer to the current limit.
</ol>

<h4><A NAME="strspcml">Salvaging Parts from a Compass-M Laser</A></h4>

Now, if you try this on a working unit, we'll have to send you for
rehabilitation. :)  However, there *are* many useful parts in these
lasers so this is acceptable practice where a failure is terminal.
The following procedure will strip a C315M laser head nearly down to
its indivisible components.  It should work with minor revisions for
C215Ms and possibly more extensive modifications for C415Ms.  With care,
all components should be undamaged.  Steps for disassembly beyond what's
described should be obvious.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Remove the cover:</b>  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsmi">Getting Inside a C315M or C415M Laser
 Head</A>.  One of the mechanical approaches is probably easiest though
 a hot plate can also be used.
<p>
<li><b>Remove the accessible optical components:</b>  See the sections
 starting with: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strcpsmf">Factory Alignment of
 Compass-M Laser Heads</A>.  Apply current to the appropriate heaters
 to remove all the stops, turning mirrors, beam sampler assembly, and
 output lens.
<p>
<li><b>Remove the cavity cover:</b> Apply current to the two serpentine
 heaters visible on the top pieces.  This will heat the sides and after
 a couple minutes, the entire cavity cover can be lifted off in one
 piece.  Take care not to damage the green-blocking (red) filter if it
 is still intact.
<p>
<li><b>Remove the laser resonator optical components:</b> Apply current to
 the appropriate heaters to remove the HR mirror, YAG assembly, Brewster plate
 assembly, and OC mirror.  Carefully heat the top of the KTP TEC with a
 soldering iron while gently grabbing the KTP crystal with a pair of padded
 tweezer to free the KTP on its little base.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
CAUTION: For the following, DO NOT go any higher than necessary as the
solder used to assemble the TECs may melt!  This could be anywhere from
138 &deg;C to 225 &deg;C depending on type.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Remove the LD and RES assemblies:</b>  Sever all the bonding wires and
 place the laser head on a temperature controlled hot plate.  Increase the
 temperature slowly until the LD and RES assemblies come free of the
 baseplate.  This will happen at a relatively low temperature and they
 will remain attached to a ceramic plate.  Lift them out with padded
 forceps.  I don't know exactly what temperature is needed to melt the
 low temperature solder but it should be well under 135 &deg;C.  The
 laser assemblies will come free of the baseplate before they fall apart.
<p>
<li><b>Remove the output window:</b> Either continue heating the empty case
 until the output window falls off or just go around it with a hot soldering
 iron for a minute or so which will accomplish the same thing.
<p>
<li><b>Disassemble the TEC stacks:</b> Place the laser assembly on the
 hot plate and continue heating it until the TEC stacks until the TECs
 and attached mounting plates come free.  The KTP TEC will also come
 free of the cermaic substrate at the same time.  Cut its 4 wires close
 to the ceramic substrate as they are attached with high temperature solder
 which will not melt without a high power soldering iron tip applied
 directly.
<p>
 Note: I kept the LD assembly intact and wired up a cable adapter to an
 LCD-3900 laser diode controller so it could be used for testing of C315M
 diodes.  The TECs were wired in series and the on-board 10K thermistor
 temperature sensor was coated in Epoxy for protection.   A CPU heatsink
 with fan was added, though forced air cooling would only be needed for
 continuous operation.
<p>
<li><b>Remove the ceramic subtrate from the underlying heat spreader and
 ceramic plate:</b> Continue increasing the temperature until the solder
 melts.  This appears to require a temperature about 25 to 50 &deg;C higher
 than for the other components.
<p>
<li><b>Head PCB:</b> I don't know if the solder for this is normal or
 low temperature so it may be necessary to use a vacuum rework station
 to free the 30 pins. :)  Or, if you don't care about the pins, cut them
 flush with the PCB and use a vacuum desoldering tool (e.g., "SoldaPullet")
 to remove as much solder as possible.  Once each joint looks like it is
 clear of solder, push the remains of the pin sideways to free it.
 Stubborn pins can be twisted from behind which will fracture the
 glass-to-metal seal and allow them to be pulled from the PCB.  DON'T
 attempt to force the PCB away from the case wall until all the pins are
 loose - it is quite thin and fragile.
</ul>
<p>
CAUTION: Don't place the ceramic components directly from the hot plate to
a cold surface as they may crack!

<h4><A NAME="strcc3gg">Coherent C315M Laser Heads - Green Glow Only</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients:</b> Coherent C315M-100 laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Faint green glow from inside when Coherent Analog
 Controller ramps up diode current, then shuts off.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Current for rated power: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> None required beyond powering on the Coherent
 Analog Controller.  Symptoms indicate a component <i>outside</i> the
 laser cavity had popped off and/or is blocking the beam.  Gentle
 rocking or shaking while listening and feeling for a rattle inside
 may provide confirmation but could also result in further damage.
</ul>
<p>
Next step: Remove the cover on each laser head as surgery will be required.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-GG1:</b> Stop 2 fell off and is blocking beam.
<p>
Stop 2 was found to be wedged in the corner between Turning Mirror 1 and
the case wall.  Stop 2 appears to be largely superfluous so I decided not
to reinstall it unless there was an obvious impact on performance.  Since
I intended to install a see-through Plexiglas cover on this laser, the
lack of Stop 2 would also allow the interior of the laser cavity to be
more visible.  The function of Stop 2 may be to help suppress stray light
to the power monitor photodiode so I felt confident it wouldn't matter
that much.  However, when attempting to power the
laser head without Stop 2, it was unable to stabilize with wild power
fluctuations until the controller finally shut down.  At first, I thought
this was due to the lack of Stop 2 affecting the photodiode response
but then noticed that one of the laser head PCB pots had fallen off, probably
during the semi-violent efforts to remove the cover.  Fortunately, it was
sitting in plain view on my operating table, a.k.a., workbench. :)  Once the
pot was soldered back in place, the laser performed normally reaching 120 mW
at well below the diode current limit and easily being set for 106 mW.
<p>
A piece of 1/8" Plexiglas was gut to just fit the top of the laser head
and taped in place with clear transparent mending tape.  It looks quite
nice and performs well.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient cured.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-GG2:</b> Turning Mirror 2 fell off.
<p>
After opening the patient, repair was quite straightforward, not even
requiring a micropositioner.  The laser could be powered up fully without
this optic in place since it is after the power monitor photodiode.  So, a
test was first performed to confirm that Turning Mirror 2 could be positioned
by hand.  Then, 5 minute Epoxy was used to secure it, just aiming the beam
cleanly through the Output Stop and holding it in place while the glue cured.
A Plexiglas cover was installed to allow for future observation. :)
<p>
Conclusion: Patient cured.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-GG3:</b> Turning Mirror 1 and Output lens fell off.
<p>
At first, I thought that this one would be almost as easy.  However, the
first attempt using the same basic procedure failed miserably as it was (1)
almost impossible to hold the optic in the cramped space where it is
located and (2) the effect on the beam is somewhat counterintiutive and
confusing since the beam reflects off of Turning Mirror 2 before passing
through the Output Stop and exiting the laser.  Therefore, I was forced to put
together my operating suite, um, micropositioner rig as shown in
<A HREF="cpsmapt1.jpg">Six-Axis Alignment Platform for Coherent
Compass-M Lasers</A>.  With this setup, repair of the optics was quite easy.
However, further diagnostic tests (not normally covered by the Patient's
health insurance!) revealed that about 50 percent of the bonding wires between
the PCB pins and ceramic laser substrate had broken, possibly due to the
two optics bouncing around inside helped along by the shipping company (name
withheld).  These were repaired by jumpering and soldering using very fine
wire.  Then a further discovery: The lower LD TEC was high resistance, nearly
open but not quite.  Since there is no way to repair it, the only treatment is
to do a bypass - install a jumper to short across the lower LD TEC and hope
that the single upper LD TEC is capable of cooling the pump diode at the
operating current.  It seems to work well enough on the LDC-3900 if the
baseplate is kept cool enough but will not stabilize at full power on the
Coherent controller.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient will have to limit activities to being power using
LDC-3900, no more Coherent controller for it, at least not at full power! :)
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-GG4:</b> Turning mirror 2 fell off.
<p>
Same treatment as for Patient #C315M-100-H-GG2, above.
<p>
However, several months later when in for a routine checkup, Patient was found
to have very low and variable output power on Coherent controller, not
putting out more than 20 mW at the diode current limit.  While initial
suspicions focused on internal contamination, this seemed unlikely.  Even
though the laser head cover had been removed to fix the original fallen off
parts problem, it was well sealed following the procedure.  The behavior
appeared more like one of the temperature settings was incorrect.
To test for an incorrect LD temperature setting due to a bad resistor
(most likely since this has happened on other C315Ms, see the next
section), an external pot was substituted for P2 but this didn't help
immediately, though it was apparent that something unrelated was changing
as the output power was gradually increasing to 70 mW and would stay there
even when going back to the original P2 pot.  However, the output power
would not stabilize fully even if set at only 50 mW.  The laser head was
then tested using the LDC-3900 on which it was easy to get more than 100 mW at
only 1.85 A (well below the diode current limit of 2.12 A) without any serious
optimization.  When put back on the Coherent controller, Patient #C315M-100-H-GG4
was back to its old self, running at 105 mW on only 1.65 A, similar to
its vital signs in past examinations, and has now worked fine over three days
and a dozen power cycles.  I suspect a problem with the RES set-point or
RES TEC, probably a bad connection on the head PCB or an intermittent
wire bond inside, but a close inspection didn't show anything.
<p>
Conclusion: While the original problem has been cured, the patient will
be monitored periodically and/or asked to return if there are any major
changes in performance.

<h4><A NAME="strcc3wl1">Coherent C315M Laser Heads - Weak Lasing 1</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients:</b> Several Coherent C315M-100 and one C315M-150 laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Unable to achieve 100 mW at diode current limit.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 28 to 145 mW maximum.
 <li>Current for maximum power: Current limit.
 <li>Beam quality: Good.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> While on Coherent Analog Controller, the P6 pot was
 turned counterclockwise in small increments until the power would not
 increase.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W1:</b> 75 mW at 2.25 A.  Weak but stable.
<p>
Laser medical insurance refused to pay for any tests.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient instructed to take it easy on the photons and
not attempt to run at full power.  Output power was set to 70 mW using
the P6 head PCB pot.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W2:</b> 68 mW at 2.66 A.  Weak and variable.
<p>
Although initial testing suggested that this patient might have a weak
pump diode, more extensive (and costly for Laser Medical Insurance!)
testing on the C315M Diagnostic Unit suggested that this was
not the case and probably not even something inside the laser head.
It was possible to get a stable 100 mW at less than 2.00 A of pump
current on the LDC-3900 without much fiddling.  This would
normally indicate a healthy laser.  What tipped me off to this anomaly was
some peculiar behavior when using the Coherent Analog Controller: The output
power peaked during the initial ramp-up *before* the search routine got
started and output power at a particular diode current seemed to go down
after that.  And, it seemed to be a struggle to get 60 mW at 2.5 A even though
during the initial part of the search phase, more than 65 mW was produced on
some runs.  Since the search routine doesn't
touch the LD temperature, my suspicion was that for some reason, the LD
temperature is not being specified correctly by the head PCB.  The optimal
setting on the LDC-3900 is around 12 &deg;C which seems a bit low but
not unreasonable.  What I've discovered so far is that R10 on the head PCB
(see: <A HREF="315cct1.pdf">Schematic of C315M Laser Head PCB (Common
Wiring)</A>) which is supposed to be 120K measures over 400K on the bad
head and is around 120K on 3 other heads.  So, the P2 pot which sets the
LD temperature is set correctly but the high resistance R10 results in a
lower than correct input to the controller.  While the pot does have an
effect, the voltage is less than half of the correct value. In fact, it
appears as though R10 on this head was either repaired or modified as
there are actually a pair of SMT resistors piggybacked and the solder
job isn't great (though that's not the cause, at least not directly).
(I later discovered that many C315M laser heads have the piggybacked
arrangement and several had open R10s.)
<p>
Transplant surgery was performed with the organ donor being an obsolete
1 GB SCSI disk drive. :)  The patient has recovered nicely, easily
achieving more than 100 mW on the Coherent controller after adjusting
the LD temperature set-point for best (lowest) Iop.  This requires a
interative approach since there is no way to disable the automatic
power control on the Coherent controller.  Thus, adjusting the P2 pot
once the laser has stabilized doesn't affect diode current or output
power directly.  So, P2 must be turned a bit and the power set button 
is pressed to repeat the ramp-up phase of the algorithm.  Vital stats:
<p>
<PRE>
                        Is            Iop
                      Search       Operating      Output
   C315M-100-H-W2   Current (A)   Current (A)     Power
 ---------------------------------------------------------
       PreOp           2.00       2.66 (Imax)      68 mW
       PostOp          1.68       2.21            105 mW
</PRE>
<p>
However, for some unknown reason, the diode current at 100 mW isn't quite
as low as on the LDC-3900 where 105 mW was achieved at about 2 A.  The
LD temperature on this patient does appear to be more critical perhaps
than on other C315Ms.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient cured but will be re-evaluated in 6 months.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W3:</b> 107 mW at 2.20 A.
<p>
This one is not really very ill, just a bit tired.
The only reason it is listed here is that achieving full power reliably
using the Coherent Analog Controller is not possible.  When set to 100 mW
or above, the power may never stabilize when started from a complete
shutdown despite the power actually going up as high as 107 mW at times.
It may actually be more a peculiarity of the controller algorithm rather
than a very sick laser head.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W4:</b> 36 mW at 2.52 A.  Behavior is normal in all
respects except for being very weak.  In fact, while it will run on the
Coherent Analog Controller, the control panel power level pot has to be
set no higher than 50 percent for the output to stabilize, about 32 mW
maximum.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient appears content to run at low power.  No extreme
measures called for.  Followup visit scheduled for 1 month.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W5:</b> 70 mW at 2.65 A.  Weak but stable.
Tests using LDC-3900 show no unusual behavior.
<p>
Conclusion:  Patient instructed to take it easy on the photons and
not attempt to run at full power.  Output power was set to 65 mW using
the P6 head PCB pot.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W6:</b> 28 mW at 2.37 A.  Weak but stable with doughnut
shaped beam. This patient behaves normally except for the extreme weakness
and the unusual beam shape.  However, R10 was found to be open resulting in
excessive diode temperature but external control of diode temperature
had little effect.  This overheating may be the original cause of the
malady.  Aside from that, everything is fine. :)  There may also be
internal damage inside the laser cavity under the roof.  For now,
the patient will be allowed to run at low power since cavity surgery is
generally very expensive and risky.
<p>
Update: Bad news. Patient #C315M-100-H-W6 has now taken a turn for the worse
and is very weak (around 1 mW at max current).  Further overheating may
have been the cause.  Arrangements are being made.....  A post mortem
reveals that the missing center was due to dirt on the first turning
mirror.  In fact, there is evidence of contamination on most visible
optical surfaces, source unknown.  Optics cleaning resulted in an increase
in output power to almost 4 mW.  Similar contamination is most likely present
on the optical surfaces inside the cavity and may be the primary cause of the
low power.  Further findings may be available after partial dissection (i.e.,
removal of the cavity cover).
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W7:</b> 93 mW at 2.18 A.  Slightly weak but stable.
R10 was found to be open but tests using LDC-3900 show no unusual behavior.
<p>
Conclusion:  Patient instructed to take it easy on the photons and
not attempt to run at full power.  Output power was set to 90 mW
using the P6 pot.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W8:</b> weak and hot, no data available.  Based on
admitting physician's experience, R10 on head PCB was tested and found to
be open.  Using an R10 substitution device (pot and 120K ohm resistor),
patient was found to be otherwise healthy, easily achieving 102 mW.  R10
replacement surgery was successful.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient has been cured.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-W9:</b> 99 mW at 2.39 A.
Consistent power above 100 mW could not be achieved even at the current
limit of 2.42 A.  Behavior was similar to that of having an open R10 but
this was not the case.  Adjustment of TL (P2) pot was attempted and was
highly successful with peak power reaching 130 mW and beyond but stable
behavior in the 100 to 106 mW range could not be obtained: During final
ramp-up, the power tends to jump from below 100 mW to above 110 mW very
quickly, confusing the controller algorithm.  Output power
was set to 110 mW for the time being.  This is reached consistently on
more than one Coherent Analog Controller.
<p>
Conclusion: Patient is happy with boosted output power but will be
re-evaluated at periodic intervals.  The cause of the unstable behavior
is under investigation.
<p>
Comments: Out of more than 65 undamaged C315M laser heads tested, only 6 or so
were incapable of being set at or above rated power.  Of these, two had
open R10s and have either been cured or will be shortly.  Two others
had open R10s but weren't so lucky.  This string of bad R10s is interesting
as this resistor dissipates so little power that an electrical cause for
its failure in four units is ruled out.  It must have been a bad batch
of surface mount resistors or trauma in installing them.  For some reason,
a number of heads have a pair of resistors piggy-backed to form R10, no doubt
soldered in by hand.  Patient #C315M-100-H-W1 may be called back in
for testing if possible to rule out a similar problem.
<p>
Rather than attempting some heroic treatment options on the others,
output power for each head was set slightly below the maximum.  Patients
#C315M-100-H-W1 and #C315M-100-H-W3 were sent home.  Patient  #C315M-100-H-W4
is under observation.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-150-H-W1:</b> 145 mW at 2.61 A.  Although a peak power of
over 160 mW has been seen during initialization, this patient will not
stabilize above about 145 mW.  Pump diode temperature (P2) and KTP center
point (P4) were adjusted without noticeable improvement.  There are no
other anomalies to suggest that this is anything other than a tired laser.
<p>
Conclusion:  Patient instructed to take it easy on the photons and
not attempt to run at full power.  Output power was set to 125 mW
using the P6 pot.  At this power level, it is running at a comfortable
86.3% on the diode.

 <li>Current for maximum power: Increasing to current limit.
 <li>Beam quality: Good.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> While on Coherent Analog Controller, the laser

</ul>
<p>
<b>Patients #C315M-100-H-OT1 and #C315M-100-H-OT2</b>: Open LD TEC.  These
lasers will not run with stable output on the Coherent Analog Controller
but should work on a third party or home-built controller if the upper LD
TEC is driven and the baseplate temperature is maintained low enough.
Patient #C315M-100-H-OT1 has been tested on the LDC-3900 and can achieve and

Conclusion: This is a chronic problem with no cure.  However, with special
care, these lasers can still live nearly normally, just not on the Coherent
controller.

<h4><A NAME="strcc3nl">Coherent C315M Laser Heads - No Lasing</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients:</b> Coherent C315M-100 laser heads.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Absolutely no signs of any green light anywhere.
 Controller ramps up diode current, then shuts off.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Current for rated power: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> None required beyond powering on the Coherent

</ul>
<p>
Next step: Remove the cover on each laser head as surgery will be required.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-NL1:</b> OC mirror popped off.
<p>
At first, I attempted to power this laser and orient the OC mirror <i>by
hand</i> hoping for a miracle.  Well, no miracle occurred.  So, perhaps a
year later after constructing my <A HREF="cpsmapt1.jpg">Six-Axis Alignment
Platform for Coherent Compass-M Lasers</A>, I decided to do battle with
this one.  The complete description can be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strrrcmo">Reinstalling the OC Mirror on a Compass-M\
Laser Head</A>.  The long and the short of it is that in addition to the
popped OC, one surface of the KTP crystal was dinged and scratched, so
there was no chance of any green light by replacing only the OC mirror.
Afterthe KTP was replaced, this laser could be at least partially restored,
though its output power is low.
<p>
Conclusions: Condition weak but stable.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-NL2:</b> HR mirror popped off and KTP TEC broke in half.
<p>
If only the HR popped off, replacing it would be similar to the procedure for
patient #C315M-100-H-NL1, above.  However, with the entire KTP assembly unusable
in its present form, this would be considerably more complicated.  The KTP
TEC (or what was left of it) is soldered to the baseplate but heating with
my Weller iron was unable to free it.  In addition, the wire connections
(2 for the TEC and 2 for the temperature sensor) are soldered with normal
solder making it difficult to remove them without cutting.  Thus, chances
of swapping the undamaged KTP assembly from a DOA C315M laser head is slim
to none.  What I may do is install and align the HR for maximum IR power,
and then install a normal piece of AR coated KTP.  The laser will no longer
have the fabulous C315M single mode specs but would still operate at close
to rated power.
<p>
Conclusions: Further work needed.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-NL3:</b> Entire laser substrate assembly broke free.  DOA.
<p>
This one became a show and tell unit, though some of its organs did make
their way into other repair jobs, being replaced with unusuable organs
that look acceptable. :)  The diode's GRIN lens and green-blocking (red)
filter were smashed, and coatings on the HR mirror and YAG rod were scratched.
But, the KTP, OC mirror, turning mirrors, and output optics survived mostly
unscathed.

<h4><A NAME="strcc3mp">Coherent C315M Laser Heads - Mode Problems</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patients:</b> Coherent C315M laser head ID#s 150-2, 100-150, 100-161.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Non-single frequency operation.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 155, 105, 96 mW.
 <li>Current for rated power: 2.59 A, 2.13 A, 2.00 A.
 <li>Beam quality: Usually good.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> The basic battery of tests were performed with
 nothing of note.  Behavior was normal, beam shape was good, output appeared
 strong and stable.  Laser heads had already been run on another Coherent
 controller with no difference in behavior.
</ul>
<p>
Patient C315M-150-H-2 (ID# C315M-150-2) returned to the Hospital with the
complaint of spurious longitudinal
modes appearing at all times and all power levels.  There was also mention
of higher order spatial modes - TEM02 at times but this was never
confirmed.  It had passed the basic
battery of tests a few months ago and given a clean bill of health but now
was exhibiting these very unusual symptoms for Compass-M lasers.
<p>
So, the more expensive Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI) and
output scope tests were ordered.  The SFPI was custom built for Sam's
Coherent Compass-M Laser Hospital.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserlia.htm#liasgsf2">Sam's $2.00 Scanning Fabry-Perot
Interferometer</A>  Indeed, with the benefit of this advanced equipment,
problems were immediately apparent with Patient C315M-150-H-2.  See
<A HREF="c315s1-1.jpg">Comparison of Healthy C315M Laser and One With Mode
Problems</A>.  The top photos are of the SFPI display, with a span of roughly
2 FSRs of the SFPI (each about 7.8 GHz) across the screen so a single mode
laser would still appear with 2 peaks on the display.  The FSR of the
C315M laser cavity is about 3 GHz.  Thus, if it were operating with stable
multi-longitudinal mode output, there would be 4, 6, or a higher even
number of stable peaks.  The bottom photos are of the corresponding
output power, with a scale of about 10 us per division horizontally.  Zero
power for all displays is 2 divisions from the bottom of the screen.
<p>
The left pair of photos is for laser ID# C315M-150-1, a normal well
behaved middle-age volunteer, tested as part of this study to provide a
baseline for the records.  It shows a clean peak which translates to being
rock-steady when viewed in real time.  There is negligible noise
and no ghost peaks.  While this was made after stabilizing, even
during the initialization and ramp-up with very erratic power variations,
at any given instant, these lasers are almost always clean single frequency.
The output power shown in the bottom photo is flat-lined, which is good.
<p>
But for Patient C315M-150-H-2, the sad story can be read by even someone who
has never seen a laser before.  The middle pair of photos is at full power
while the set on the right is at about 10 percent power (with the display
scaled appropriately).  Although there is a dominant main peak, even
this is rather noisy.  But there are also at least two lower intensity
"ghosts".  They are much less intense (meaning they aren't present all
the time) and weaker being about 50 percent and 15 percent of the main peak.
They are also not stable, appearing to possibly be sweeping over a range
of a few GHz.  The relative intensities of all the peaks would also vary over
time.
<p>
Significant oscillation could clearly be seen in the output power.
At 150 mW, the p-p amplitude in this case is about 40 mW (I've seen
more than 75 mW p-p at times); at 15 mW, it is about 8 mW p-p.
The frequency is typically between 10 and 25 kHz and varied slowly,
suggesting a thermal, possibly alignment, issue.  As can be seen, the
p-p amplitude of the power variation could exceed 50 percent of the
average.  A smaller random fluctuation at low frequencies is also
present, though swamped by the high frequency oscillation in the photos.
Healthy C315Ms show virtually no noise or fluctuations in output power
once stabilized.  Unlike human hearts, flat-line behavior is desirable
in a CW laser. :)
<p>
Because the relative intensities of the ghost peaks seemed to be decreasing
with time, on a hunch, as an additional test, the laser head heatsink was
allowed to get a bit warm (by turning off the fan).  Eventually, the spurious
peaks virtually disappeared, reason unknown but possibly due to a change in
alignment.  However, this would not be an acceptable long term cure.
<p>
Up until this point, of all the C315M lasers I've known, only one other one
had a non-single frequency problem that anyone is aware of.  But, on that
unit, there were just certain "bad" spots where the power would stabilize
but the laser would continuously switch between two stable (clean)
longitudinal modes.  Changing power to a higher or lower setting would
result in normal single frequency operation.  But on this laser, the
ghost modes are present at all power levels.  In fact, they may even
be worse at very low power.  Of course, not everyone who acquires a
C315M (or C215M) laser requires it to be single frequency or tests for
it.  So, there could be other sick ones out this non-single frequency
spiking behaviour a known failure mode for high mileage C215M and C315M
lasers (though this isn't widely publicized).
<p>
I have yet to reproduce the TEM02 complaint but perhaps it's there all
along in the form of a subtle lumpiness in the beam profile which I'm
missing.
<p>
About six months after testing Patient C315M-150-H-2, SFPI and output
scope tests (now performed on a more routine basis due to reduced costs)
revealed that a C315M-100 laser head (Patient C315M-100-H-150) had very similar
problems, but only at output power levels above about 85 mW.  Below 85 mW,
everything was normal - flat lined.  Above 85 mW, oscillations with positive
and negative pulses at around 4 or 5 KHz appeared with a p-p amplitude of
100 percent <i>or more</i> of the average power - at 100 mW, the output
was pulsing between around 50 and 150 mW.  It wasn't always present since
whether oscillations occurred apparently are somewhat dependent on where
on the gain curve the laser is lasing.  But when they were present, the
results would be devastating for almost any critical application.
However, when restarted cold one occasion, there were no oscillations
present once the laser had stabilized, though there were clearly
transient oscillations during the final ramp-up.  Another time, they were
present during the transients and after the laser first stabilized, but
then died out after a few minutes.  These never show up in well behaved
C315M lasers.  So, it might only occur when the initialization algorithm
settles in on some specific peaks of the the optimization function.  Or,
perhaps, the laser head the way the laser head was bolted down on the
heat sink was slightly different resulting in a tiny change in an
already marginal internal alignment.  Or maybe the phase of the moon.... :)
A few months later, patient 100-161 came in with similar behavior but
above about 75 mW.
<p>
And a patient from another batch of C315M-100s who wished to remain
anonymous exhibited spiking behavior transiently during initialization,
mostly at low power.  But it always stabilized at the 100 mW level without
incident.  This behavior has become more common but doesn't seem to result
in any long term problems.
<p>
Patient C315M-100-H-150 was told to simply ease off on strenuous
activities and report back in six months. :)  Interestingly, this
is one of the oldest C315M laser heads I've ever seen with a
manufacturing date of 1997.  Patient C315M-100-H-161 was given
similar advice.
<p>
Conclusions: The non-single frequency operation and noise in the output power
makes these lasers eligible for long term paid laser compensation. :)  They
will continue to be studied but a cure is unlikely.  So, some non-critical
applications may need to be found where a lot of light is needed but the
quality of the light is unimportant.

<h4><A NAME="strcc3ns">Coherent C315M Laser Head - Does Not Reliably
 Stabilize</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient:</b> Coherent C315M-150 laser head ID# C315M-150-6.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> May not stabilize at full power.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 162 mW.
 <li>Current for rated power: 1.88 A.
 <li>Beam quality: Excellent.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> The controller was power cycled multiple times to
 determine if there was any pattern to the failures.  It seemed to have a
 mood problem (not mode, mood!).  Sometimes it would consistently stabilize
 while others it would consistently fail.  When it failed to stabilize, the
 power would fluctuate over a period of a few seconds, typically from 110
 to 170 mW.  Sometimes, it would eventually settle down, either abruptly,
 or with a diminishing power variation amplitude until it became constant.
 The problem is most severe at higher power.  The laser will stabilize
 very reliably below a setting of about 135 to 140 mW.
</ul>
<p>
Patient C315M-150-H-6 (ID# C315M-150-6) had passed basic tests several
months ago but has now returned with a complaint of "Ringing" printed on
the heatsink.  I assume this meant that the power was oscillating and
not stabilizing reliably.  While that behavior is similar to what happens
with the typical weak Compass-M laser being set
at too high a power level so that the pump diode reaches its current limit
with insufficient output power, in this case, there is a great deal of
headroom on the diode, being at only 86.3%.  So, pump power is not the
problem.
<p>
Further tests were approved by the laser's health insurance provider including
a SPS (Startup and Power Set) scan.  This test monitors the power fluctuations
during initialization and also permits various adjustments in real-time so
that their effects can be recorded.
<p>
For reference, <A HREF="c315m1-2.gif">C315M DPSS Laser Startup
Followed by 25, 60, and 100 Percent Power Settings</A> shows normal SPS
scan behavior.  Following the initial search routine, the output power
drops back and then rises with normal wild fluctuations but then once it
exceeds about 110 percent of the set power, it quickly settles down
and is then virtually constant.  This plot also shows 3 restarts at varying
power levels.
<p>
However, the SPS scans for this laser are quite remarkable.  For example
<A HREF="c315m6-2.gif">Unstable C315M DPSS Laser SPS Scans - Startup at
Full Power</A> is the typical behavior from a cold start while
the composite plot
<A HREF="c315m6-8.gif">Unstable C315M DPSS Laser SPS Scans - Startup and
Restart</A> shows the same laser run from a cold start, followed by some
fiddling with the P4 and P5 laser head pots, followed by a restart to full
power which ends with continuous oscillation in power.  It was possible to
get it to stabilize by turning the pots, but a subsequent run using
the new setting would behave no better than it was originally.  There
was no combination of P4 and P5 pot settings that resulted in noticeably
improved behavior.  Sometimes, though, the laser would start out oscillating
but then twitch a bit and settle down as shown in
<A HREF="c315m6-9.gif">Unstable C315M DPSS Laser SPS Scans - Startup and
and Eventually Stabilizing</A>.  And, finally, one where the laser is
particularly unstable during the search part of the initialization, but
settles down without incident:
<A HREF="c315m6-5.gif">Unstable C315M DPSS Laser SPS Scans - Startup with
Instability During Search but Normal Final Output</A>.
<p>
Another test was ordered to check for other problems.  A Scanning
Fabry-Perot Interferometer SFPI was used to confirm
single frequency operation and at the same time, for clean (low noise)
output power.  It passed both of these tests with flying photons.
<p>
Conclusions: After an extended conference, it has been decided that this
laser head will be derated to a C315M-125.  There is plenty of reserve
on the pump diode - it will be running at only about 76 percent at 125 mW.
Where the laser head is to be driven from a home-built or third party
controller, it may be fine at or beyond full power, but confuses the
Coherent controller at high power.

<h4><A NAME="strcc3dd">Coherent C315M Laser Morgue</A></h4>

Most of the following patients were DOA though most organs were salvageable
for possible transplant.  There was one miracle which left via the front
door. :)
<p>
<p>Patient #C315M-100-H-DD0:</b> DOA - Patient's heart (pump diode) killed by
defective Coherent Analog Controller.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315y">Single Point Failure Mode of the C315M Analog
Controller</A>.  The remains have been preserved for possible future diode
transplant.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-DD1:</b> DOA - Entire laser platform broke free of case.
While the pump diode itself was good, the GRIN lens was destroyed.  Awaiting
a donor GRIN lens from dead diode.  The HR mirror is beyond hope but while
the YAG rod was slightly scratched, it may still be somewhat usable if the
lasing spot is carefully selected.  Other optics and TECs still good and
available as donor organs.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-DD2:</b> DOA - Entire laser platform as well as pump diode
mounting bracket broke free of case.  The green-blocking (red) filter was
smashed and had to be removed (a filterectomy was performed).  The mounting
plate was reattached with silver Epoxy and with pump diode alignment, there
is some green lasing though it seems somewhat weak.  However, since only the
pump diode is being powered due to the lack of a case and head PCB, it's
possible that conditions are far from optimal.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-DD3 and #C315M-100-H-DD4:</b> DOA - Lower LD TEC broke in half
allowing pump diode GRIN lens to the smash green-blocking (red) filter.  The
patient is awaiting the invention of a suitable repair procedure.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-DD5 and #C315M-100-H-DD6:</b> DOA - HR mirror broke off.  DOA.
Available as organ transplant donor.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-DD7</b>: DOA - LD platform shifted position probably from
overheating and melting its solder attachment smashing green-blocking (red)
filter and breaking HR mirror off mount.  DOA.  Available as
organ transplant donor.
<p>
<b>Patient #C315M-100-H-DI1</b>: Intermittent pump diode due to bad solder joint
and/or loose feed-through on diode package.  The laser would run for a short
while if the negative pin on the diode was pressed just so but would not
stay on.  Heroic attempts at removing pump diode without damaging laser
failed miserably with the green-blocking (red) filter being smashed and
the HR mirror breaking loose.  The laser is now available as an organ donor
(organs have been removed to storage) but pump diode was rushed to emergency
surgery and is now recovering.  The front plate with the GRIN lens was removed
using a knife blade revealing a C-block diode screwed to the case and a bad
solder connection between the tab and the positive terminal.  This was cleaned
up and resoldered, the diode was cleaned with acetone, and the front plate was
replaced in the original position aligned via the residual solder originally
holding it in place, then secured with Epoxy.  Diode vital signs:

Exploratory surgery revealed loose bonding wires to external pins on
laser case.  Jumpers were soldered from pins to traces on ceramic
substrate resulting in an instant recovery.  Cover was Epoxied back
in place.  No cause has been found except that perhaps too few bonding
wires were present for high diode current.

<h4><A NAME="strcc4wl">Coherent C415M Laser Head - Weak Lasing</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient:</b> Coherent C415M-200 laser head.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Powers up but maximum output is around 10 mW.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: Low - about 10.0 mW using the Coherent Analog Controller.
 <li>Current for rated power: Not measured.
 <li>Beam quality: Good.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> Powered up on Coherent Analog Controller (the
 one for the C415M) using its autostart adapter, and then confirmed using
 my home-built C315M  control panel (this is compatible with all Compass-M
 lasers).
</ul>
<p>
To rule out a Controller problem, I also powered the laser head on a
laser diode driver but was unable to obtain any green light even at
a current of 2 A.  This was necessary since I had as yet not confirmed
that the controller was operational.  Later, it did successfully power a
like-new C415M-200 head at 217 mW.
<p>
Conclusions: Patient weak but stable.  Futher diagnostic tests may be
preformed in the future.

<h4><A NAME="strcc4bb">Coherent C415M Laser Head - Bowling Ball Rolling Around
 Inside</A></h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Patient:</b> Coherent C415M-100 laser head.
<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Something definitely broken loose inside.
<li><b>Vital Signs:</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Output power: 0.0 mW.
 <li>Current for rated power: NA.
 <li>Beam quality: NA.
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Initial Tests:</b> None required.  This wasn't a slight rattle.  There
 was obviously an object of significant mass rolling around inside.
</ul>
<p>
Next step: Remove the cover as surgery will be required.  However, on a
C415M head, this is not as obvious as with the C315M as the cover is
actually recessed into the case providing no easy way to scrape away at
the solder to remove it.  Heating the entire head until the solder melted
might have worked.  Or, it might have melted other things as well.  What
I finally did was to drill a small hole near one corner and then use an
awl to pry up the lid.  This worked very well.  Since I was intending to
replace it with a Plexiglass cover anyhow, the slightly damaged lid was
no problem.
<p>
Once the lid was off, the problem was obvious: The vanadate crystal assembly
had popped loose and it was rolling around inside.  I no longer had a
Coherent Analog Controller for the C415M so I powered up the pump diode
using a laser diode driver.  With the vanadate crystal sitting approximately
in the original position, there was a bit of green light at around 1 A.
So, I temporarily glued it using 5 minute Epoxy.  It would be a simple matter
to pull it free and reposition it if the exact orientation was really
critical (which I doubt), or use the solder melt technology to position
it precisely in the future.  Until I have access to a proper controller,
nothing more will probably be done as I don't know what reasonable values
are for the pump current and have not even determined the C415M head wiring
yet.  Unless a flock of these show up, it will probably never be done.
<p>
This patient can be viewed in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser
Equipment Gallery</A> under "Coherent Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers".
<p>
Conclusions: Further study required.

<h3><A NAME="strc315x">Coherent Analog Controller Problems</A></h3>

The Coherent Analog Controllers are quite reliable and I don't know of any
likely problems.  None of the bad ones that I've seen have had any causes
in common:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Failure of GAL logic device near the user interface connector resulting in
 a dead controller and destruction of laser head.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc315y">Single Point Failure Mode of the C315M Analog
 Controller</A>.
<p>
<li>Blown MOSFET resulting in the inability to turn the laser on (including the
 LED on the laser head).  However, +5 VDC on the user interface connector
 was still present.  The cause was found by observing that the MOSFET was
 running very hot.  A replacement from my parts unit fixed the problem.
<p>
<li>Erratic main interlock relay.  Some sets of contacts on the large
 blue multipole relay were intermittent resulting in the unit coming
 on only when tapped or twisted in just the right way.  A replacement
 relay fixed the unit.  Note: Apparently, some older versions lack
 this relay entirely.
<p>
<li>Bad connections to main interlock relay.  On some units, the
 the heavy relay is attached to the main PCB by several thick solid
 wires.  Vibrations may result in the connections (probably at the
 relay end) becoming loose resulting in the unit coming on only when
 tapped.  On this particular unit, the broken connection was readily
 accessible so a jumper wire could be added.  However, some units use
 flexible wires to connect the relay which is mounted with RTV silicon
 and thus should not be susceptible to this problem.  Which mounting
 scheme is used on any particular unit appears to be random as I've
 see both on units with the same date code.  Most appear to use the
 thick solid wires though.
<p>
<li>Blown logic chip (I forget which one) discovered by blistering on
 its surface. :)  This particular controller became my parts unit because
 (1) it had been very heavily disassembled by someone else prior to getting
 it and I figured that the chance of it ever working again was vanishingly
 small, and (2) the part could not be identified.  The original cause may
 have been continuous operation without a heatsink but I don't know for sure.
<p>
<li>Intermittent laser diode overcurrent shutdown.  No fault has been found
 and the diode current never even approaches the current limit.  Often, this
 will happen just as the diode is turned on.  Cause unknown but I suspect
 the interlock relay as tapping the unit may cause it to shut down.  No
 bad connections could be found.
<p>
<li>Initialization algorithm gets stuck in search routine.  After the first
 powerup cycle (which usually works correctly), subsequent attempts (either
 by pressing the power Set button, flipping the power and/or laser swtiches
 off and on, or even by cycling DC power), result in the controller never
 getting past the search routine (possibly not executing it completely),
 not dropping back and entering final ramp-up, and Ready never comes on.
 After removing DC power for a few minutes, one powerup cycle may work
 but then the symptoms reappear.  Cause unknown.

<h2>Coherent Compass 532 Green DPSS Laser</h2>

These sections include notes on operating, testing, adjustment, and repair
of Coherent Compass 532 green DPSS lasers.  Rated output power ranges from
10 mW to 300 mW or more.  So far, all the units I've seen are either
532-200 or 532-200/100, both of which use the same basic hardware.  I've
heard that low power versions like the 532-10 might NOT use the same hardware
to keep this in mind when reading and digesting what follows.  For a general
description, and information on their organization and specifications, see
the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc532">Coherent
Compass 532-200 Green DPSS Laser</A>.  Detailed photos of the cavity can be
found in the <A HREF="laserpic/laserpic.htm">Laser Equipment Gallery</A>
under "Coherent Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers".  For the procedures,
below, it may be best to open that page in a new browser window for reference.
<p>
Note: The following is far from complete due to a total lack of available
documentation.  In particular, there is currently no procedure for aligning the
electronics associated with the fine cavity control (D-AMP, Phase, and
Offset.).  What is present are basic tests to identify major problems,
idenfication of which pots can be safely turned, setting output power,
and optimizing LD and KTP temperature.
<p>
A complete set of schematics of the C532 laser is available.  I will provide
this upon request if contacted via the

<h3><A NAME="strc532o">Operation of the C532</A></h3>

It is assumed that your C532 laser is the end-user version which includes the
AC input module (in the cool black case).  This uses a voltage doubler (115
VAC) or bridge rectifier (230 VAC), filter capacitors, and 300 V to 12 V DC-DC
converter to power the controller.  If the input module is not present, a
DC power supply (12 V, minimum of 5 A for the 532-200/100, but see Note 2
below) will be required to drive the controller via the 20 (or 25) pin SIL
connector (J6) on the PCB.  An underrated power supply may cause the laser
to cycle on and off which probably isn't a good thing.  This connector also
has most of the status and control signals used in testing, which are passed
through to the HD15 interface connector (J4) on the rear of the complete
laser.  The head fan runs on 5 VDC which can be provided from the controller
(J6-16) or an external supply.

</PRE>
<p>
<b>Notes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>* J6 pins 3,4,19,20,21,22 are Analog Ground.  J6 pins 1,2,17,18,23,24 are
 +12 VDC.  Only certain revisions of the controller have J6 pins 21 to 25
 but they are all redundant or unused.  A 25 pin controller will mate with
 a 20 pin AC input module and vice-versa.  Just make sure the pins like up
 correctly!  Some versions may also have more pins on J4.  The schematics
 show pins 16 and 16 going to Ground.
<p>
<li>CAUTION: Some (probably lower power) versions of the C532 may run on 5 or
 5.5 VDC <b>ONLY</b> on J6.  Make sure your system actually takes 12 VDC!!!!
 In addition, Pins 14 and 15 on J4 and J6 may have different assignments
 (J4-14 and J6-14 may be LDI Fault; J4-15 and J6-15 may be Power meter or DPSS
 OFF).  Or, J4-14 may control output power but in a slightly different way
 and increasing voltage increases power.
<p>
<li>Where the AC input module is present, there are connectors for
 two possible fans, J5 and J10 (either or both may be used).  When the AC
 input module is not present, the head fan must be powered either from J6-16
 or an external 5 VDC power supply.  (The connector for the Time Meter, J7,
 may also be used for fan power if it is directly connected to +5 VDC.
 However, despite what the schematic shows, there may be a high value
 resistor to limit current to some types of time meters in which case
 it won't work.)
<p>
<li>C532-400 lasers (and possibly some others) have a different calibration
 for LDI and LDIM of 2 A/V since the maximum current may be greater than
 the available voltage range (under 5 V).
</ol>
<p>
Only three things are needed to power the laser:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Interlock jumpered to Interlock Return (J4-2 to J4-1 or J6-8 to J6-9).
 This connection must be present when power is applied.  If disconnected,
 the laser immediately goes off and will not restart until +12 VDC is removed
 and reapplied.
<p>
<li>Stable +12 VDC, 5 A minimum current rating.  Any voltage dips caused by an
 underrated power supply may result in the laser going off and restarting with
 the power-on delay.
<p>
<li>Head fan power (J4-7 to J4-9 to turn on) or +5 VDC from J6-16 or external
 5 VDC directly.  This is a 5 VDC fan!  Although not present in most versions
 of the packaged laser, adding a small fan blowing across the black power
 supply heatsink is probably also a good idea.
</ul>
<p>
Optionally, a 0 to +5 V signal applied at J4-14 or J6-14 can be used to
control output power.  0 corresponds to maximum output power.  The "Output"
pot adjusts sensitivity.  It may not be a good idea to go totally to zero
output power - there appears to be a small amount of hysteresis.
<p>
LTPWR- is a status signal that is low as long as the actual output power is
within a few percent of the specified output power.  This signal should always
be low when the laser is on unless the light loop is not regulating due to
insufficient diode power (LDIM is set too low or the laser diode is weak or
damaged).  The only time it might go off unless there is a fault is at times
during warmup if LDIM is set only slightly higher than is needed for the
specified output power.
<p>
After a 15 to 20 second delay, the laser diode should come on (LD-OFF LED
on controller board goes off) and there should be laser output at nearly
if not full output power.  During warmup, there may be some fluctuations but
far fewer than with many other DPSS lasers including the C315M and C415M or
(GASP!) older Transverse lasers. :)  If the light loop is active, the only
time the output power will change is if the pump diode current limit is
reached where the cavity parameters are fluctuating during warmup - the
optimal operating point may not be reached for 15 or 20 minutes.
<p>
If the LD_OFF LED does not go out after 30 seconds or so, double check your
connections!  If the LD_OFF LED never comes on, the is probably a power supply
problem.  If the laser goes on and off (with the LD_OFF LED also going off and
on), the 12 VDC power supply may be underrated or faulty.  If laser output is
weak or non-existent, either someone has played with all the internal
adjustments, there is an electronics problem, or the pump diode is weak or
dead.  Unfortunately, the latter appears to be quite common in high mileage
C532s.  And many C532s with time meter readings of several thousand to more
than 10,000 hours (off scale) are now showing up on the surplus market.

<h4><A NAME="strc532a">C532 Control Panel and Test Adapter</A></h4>

I have constructed a widget to permit variable power operation of either the
packaged or OEM C532, along with a Digital Panel Meter (DPM) and test jacks for
monitoring of key signals.  Note: This is only guaranteed to be totally
compatible with the C532-200/100.  Other versions may assign different
signals for J4-14/J6-14 and J4-15/J6-15.

<b>Switches and knobs:</b>

<li>Interlock Keyswitch - Must be in the on position prior to applying power.
<p>
<li>Mode - Selects between the Output Power control value (Run),

 if there is any, it will be lit.

The control panel can attach to either the J4 user interface connector or
to J6 on the C532 controller PCB via appropriate cable adapters.
<A HREF="c532dem1.jpg">C532 Demo Laser with Transparent Cavity Cover and
Control Panel</A> shows an end-view of an OEM C532 which has had its aluminum
cavity cover replaced with one of clear Plexiglas to allow the green photons
inside the laser to be seen.  It is attached to the control panel before
labeling (which is likely to happen just after pigs start flying, if then).
But I think the green-tone power knob adds a touch of class. :)
The DPM display shows LDI with the laser running at medium power.  This
particular C532 has a weak pump diode so 2.36 A is much higher
than would be the case with a totally healthy laser.  But it does produce
85 mW at 3.0 A, the LDI Rated value; and 100 mW at 3.3 A, still well below
LDIM.  DC power is provided by a small switchmode power supply (not visible
in the photo).  Yes, the laser is sitting on a mat of antistatic bubble
wrap. :)
<p>

<p>
The DPM I used is a 3-1/2 digit jumbo LED type from
<A HREF="http://www.mpja.com/">Marlin P. Jones</A> set up to have a
full scale sensitivity of 2.000 V.  Decimal point selection is
done by grounding the appropriate LED through a current limiting
resistor (normally on the DPM PCB but that can't be used with the
selection scheme employed for the control panel).  This DPM is no
longer in the MPJA catalog but they do have at least one inexpensive LCD
DPM that could be substituted with few or no changes to the circuit.
However, any DPM can be used that runs off of +5 VDC with a common
power and signal ground connection.  (CAUTION: Many inexpensive DPMs
must have isolated power - they would have to run off a battery or an
isolated power supply to be used here.)  An LCD meter is actually
preferred since it will draw much much less current than an LED meter
(e.g., 3 mA instead of 175 mA with all segments active) and only
150 mA is available from the J4 user interface connector on the end-user
C532.  So, an external +5 VDC supply might be required for an LED
DPM when the control panel is attached to J4.  Note that the input
impedance of the DPM in the schematic is 12M ohms with input resistors
selected to produce a full scale sensitivity of 2.000 V.  If a
DPM having a different input impedance is used, the voltage divider
resistors for LDI_M, LDIM_M, OE, and +5_M will have to change slightly.
<p>
The -5 VDC supply for the LM358 op-amps is provided by an ICL7660 (same as the
MAX1044 and LTC1044) DC-DC converter IC.  The current requirements are only
a couple of mA.  An alternative is to construct a simple DC-DC converter
using a 555 timer running at about 10 kHz to drive a 1:1.2 ferrite
transformer, fast recovery diode, and filter capacitor.  A suitable core
can be salvaged from the inverter of a disposable camera flash or from a
variety of other sources.
<p>
In the end, what I did was use a MAX233 (a dual RS232 receiver/transmitter
which runs on +5 VDC) salvaged from an obsolete circuit board just for its
built-in DC-DC converter.  (For a datasheet, go to
<A HREF="http://www.maxim-ic.com/">Maxim Homepage</A> and search for
"MAX233".)  Almost any IC from the MAX220-249 family could have been
used but the built-in charge pump circuit of the MAX233 doesn't require any
external capacitors and thus is a very simple solution.  A zener regulator
was used to drop the -10 VDC output to -5 VDC.  The MAX233 draws a bit more
current than chips like the MAX1044 designed as DC-DC converters but it
was also free and immediately available. :)  Since there is also a +10 VDC
output, I added another zener to provide regulated +5 VDC to the output
power pot since depending on whether the end-user or OEM C532 is being
tested, the voltage available from the laser itself, though labeled +5 VDC,
may differ by 1/2 V or more.
<p>
A custom cable adapter is needed for both J4 and J6 anyhow, so I used a
common inexpensive male DB15 connector rather than the VGA-style HD15 on the
control panel itself.  The connector for J4, of course, has to be a male HD15.
Unfortunately, although VGA cables use this same connector and thus might
be appropriate for salvage from a dead computer monitor, many if not most
will be missing key pins (not just wires, but the actual pins).  However,
this connector is available from major electronics distributors.

<h3><A NAME="strc532t">Troubleshooting and Repair of the C532</A></h3>

Where output power is less than the rated value, or fluctuates dramatically
even after a 10 minute warmup, adjustments may be needed or the thing may
just basically be broken. :)  This section will at least deal with the
easy stuff.  Pump diode replacement, if needed, is definitely for the
advanced course though just swapping the pump diode from one C532 to another
isn't that terribly complex but is still somewhat risky so the saying:
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" definitely applies here.  But if after
going through the testing below, your laser is diagnosed with a tired,
worn out, or damaged pump diode, the next section details procedures for
pump diode transplant.
<p>
IMPORTANT: The only electronic adjustments that should be attempted initially
are using the pots along the edge of the controller PCB where the cavity
connections are located.  These are identified in
<A HREF="c532pcbt.jpg">C532-200 Controller PCB Top View</A>.
The other pots probably shouldn't be touched.  It is believed that the C532
can be tested and set up for output power using only 3 adjustments: LD TMP
(Laser Diode Temperature), KTP TMP (KTP Temperature), and PHOTO (Light Feedback
Reference).  The only other pot that may need to be adjusted is LDIM (Laser
Diode Maximum Current) to reduce diode current to a safer value during
adjustments if the light regulating loop isn't able to keep the diode current
to its rated value or lower.  The final two pots - OUT ADJ and D-AMP should
also probably not be touched.  OUT ADJ controls the gain of the Output Adjust
input which should be left unconnected for testing.  D-AMP sets the amplitude
of the dither signal used for fine resonator stability/mode control.
<p>
To get inside the non-OEM C532, remove the top pair of screws at
the output-end and the bottom pair of screws at the connector-end.
Then, the top with the electronics comes off and can be flipped over
while still connected to the cavity.
<p>
Be careful about squashing wires and pots when reinstalling it.
<p>
For versions other than the C532-200 (or identical C532-200/100), the
controller PCBs differ slightly.  Lower power versions are somewhat shorter
while the stretch C532-400 is about 4 inches longer (though 2 inches of
that is simply filled with vias to keep the PCB fab process happy - or
maybe so the designers would have space for, uh, improvements. :)  However,
the circuitry is nearly identical for all versions with changes mainly
to accomodate the different power requirements.  And the adjustments are
in similar locations.  All but "LIGHT GAIN" are clearly labeled.

<h4><A NAME="strc532d">Description of the Pots</A></h4>

The following are along the edge of the controller PCB:
<p>
<ul>
<li>LD TMP.  Adjusts the laser diode temperature.  Monitor on J4-4 or J6-6.
 Calibration is: temperature in &deg;C=25-20*V.  Response is slow - wait at
 least 30 seconds for the temperature reading and/or diode current or laser
 output to stabilize.  The range is: -11.5 &deg;C to 50 &deg;C (1.875 V to
 -1.25 V on the sensor).  Clockwise increases temperature.  Not: When the
 laser diode is turned on, there is an offset of -4.95 &deg;C/A introduced
 into the control loop.  This must be there to at least partially compensate
 for the thermal resistance of the laser diode junction with respect to the
 temperature sensor.  Pot sensitivity is about 2.5 &deg;C/turn.
<p>
<li>LDIM.  Adjusts the laser diode maximum current.  Monitor on J4-13 or
 J6-13.  Clockwise increases current.  Calibration is: 1 A/V except for the
 high power C532-400 (and possibly some others) where it is 2 A/V.
<p>
<li>PHOTO.  Adjusts the light loop power setting.  Clockwise increases
 output power.  Either output power or laser diode current (LDI) can be
 used to monitor this adjustment.
<p>
<li>Output.  Adjusts the laser output power sensitivity.  Inputting a voltage
 to J4-14 or J6-14 can <i>decrease</i> the laser power setting specified by
 PHOTO.  Clockwise decreases sensitivity of output power to input voltage
<p>
<li>D-AMP.  Adjusts the amplitude of the dither signal applied to the
 electrodes on the KTP crystal.  Clockwise increases amplitude.  Monitor
 on TP3.
<p>
<li>KTP TMP.  Adjusts KTP temperature.  Monitor on J4-11 or J6-11.  Calibration
 is: temperature in &deg;C=25-20*V.  Response is fairly rapid - wait a few
 seconds for the reading and/or diode current or laser output to stabilize.
 The range is: 10 &deg;C to 55 &deg;C (0.74 V to -1.5 V on the sensor).
 Clockwise increases temperature.  Note: The polarity of the voltage on
 LD KTP pot is opposite from voltage on the temperature sensor.
 Pot sensitivity is about 1.6 &deg;C/turn.
</ul>
<p>
The functions and adjustment procedure for the LD TMP, LDIM, PHOTO, and
KTP TMP pots are described in more detail below.
<p>
The following are located elsewhere on the controller PCB and generally
shouldn't be adjusted if they haven't been touched already:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Light Gain.  Adjusts the gain of the light loop.  This doesn't appear
 too critical and can generally be left alone unless the laser is to be run
 at low output power with the light loop enabled, in which case it may need
 to be turned up.  However, this pot also affects the amplitude noise
 in the output and adjusting it may be desirable depending on the application.
 I've observed that for certain (probably not useful settings), some units
 (well, at least one!) may shut down if power output is changed suddenly
 (e.g., switched from idle maximum power on my home-built control panel) or
 just after the diode comes on at power-up, and need to be power cycled to
 restart.  I do not know if this is normal behavior.
<p>
<li>Offset.  Adjusts the null point of the mode stabilization (DC) error
 integrator.
<p>
<li>Phase.  Adjusts the phase of the dither signal relative to the internal
 oscillator and feedback signal.
</ul>
<p>
The functions of the pots related to resonator stability/mode control (D-AMP,
Offset, and Phase) will probably NOT affect output power in a dramatic way
where the laser is running at decent power, not just above threshold (a few
percent, not a factor of 2).  Thus, leave them alone!!!
<p>
Note that since all the pots are multiturn types with no hard end-stops,
labeling their original position isn't possible.  It would be better to
measure their resistance settings and write these down before touching
anything!  This can be done without removing the pots or even the PCB by
just measuring across the appropriate accessible component pins that connect
to the pot pins with a DMM (refer to the schematics).
<p>
For LDIM, LD TMP, and KTP TMP, making a record of the original settings by
measuring their corresponding monitor signals on J4 or J6 would also be
desirable.
<p>
The good news is that the only piece of test equiment needed for basic
testing and adjustment is a DMM, though setting of output power precisely
will eventually require a laser power meter, and the mode stabilization
adjustments will require an oscilloscope.

<h4><A NAME="strc532i">Initial Testing and Adjustment of the C532</A></h4>

The most important thing to check assuming the LD_OFF LED turns off (meaning
the pump diode is receiving power) is to compare LDI (Laser Diode Current)
with LDIM (Laser Diode Current Maximum).  These are pins 12 and 13 on J4 or
J6.  Typical LDIM values are between 3.00 and 3.75 A.  The typical operating
current for a new laser ranges from under 1 A (10 mW out) to more than 2.75 A
(200 mW out) but depending on the particular sample of the laser, LDI vary
by +/- 25 percent from these.  The values of LDI at rated output power and
LDIM, as well as the rated current for the diode, and diode and KTP optimum
temperature settings for the particular laser cavity, will be listed on the
cavity cover.  The LD and KTP temperature settings are only precisely correct
for the laser when new and operating at the rated output power.  They may
differ by several degrees as components (primarily the pump diode) age and
also will not be optimal if the laser is run at reduced power.  (The diode
parameters apply of course only to the original diode.  If it has been
replaced, they should be updated.  The KTP TMP setting might also change
slightly since the intracavity mode shape and position may also be different
with the replacement diode.)
<p>
Check the jumper JP4.  This selects between current mode and light mode.
If it is in the current mode position, power down, and move it to light mode.
<p>
If when operating in light mode, the LDI and LDIM readings are nearly the same
and varying the LDIM pot changes LDI, then it is likely that the diode is
being driven as hard as is allowed but for some reason, the laser output is
not up to the specified setting.  Note that because of the way the circuitry
is designed, LDI may be slightly less (maybe 0.1 A) than LDIM even when the
current is maxed out.
<p>
At this point, I would recommend that regardless of the output power rating
of the laser, the PHOTO pot be adjusted to reduce output power so that the
LDI value is at or below the diode's rated value (listed on the cavity cover).
No need to be overworking the poor diode during these adjustments. :)
As long as there is still some laser output, adjustments can be performed.
This should also permit the LD TMP (diode temperature) setting to be fairly
close to the listed value.  If the PHOTO pot has no effect even after 12
turns counterclockwise, the light loop isn't functioning or the power is so
low that it is below the point at which the light loop operates so use the
LDIM pot to reduce the diode current instead.
<p>
Next, inspect the beam shape.  I don't know the exact specification but the
beam from even a factory fresh C532 is slightly elliptical being somewhat
taller than it is wide and some may be worse than others.  However, if the
beam is very misshapen or broken in to 2 or more spots, there is likely
internal damage to the cavity.  If this is the case, the output power will
also likely be very low, possibly less than 1 mW.  One common occurrance (I
know of 2 cases of this) is that the monitor photodiode breaks loose from the
adhesive holding it in place and flies into the magnet of the Faraday rotator,
part of the YAG crystal assembly.  This smashes the Brewster plate in front
of it resulting in both low power and a messed up beam.  Repair will require
opening the cavity.  More on this later.
<p>
Assuming the beam looks decent, the next step is to check and adjust LD and
KTP Temperature.  If the light loop is working, diode current can be used
as a means of setting these parameters since it will be lowest when they are
optimal.  If LDIM is limiting diode current, output power will need to be
monitored via LTPWR- (J4-10 or J6-5) or with a laser power meter.
With either diode current or output power, there will likely be small
random/cyclical variations due to resonator thermal expansion which will
need to be mentally averaged out before deciding if each adjustment made
things better or worse.
<p>
<ul>
<li>LD TMP can be monitored at J4-4 or J6-6.  The actual temperature will
 be: (-V * 20) + 25 &deg;C.  It should be pretty close to the value listed
 on the cavity cover.  Try adjusting it slightly while monitoring diode
 current (light loop on) or laser output (light loop off).  IMPORTANT: There
 is a significant time lag in response.  Adjust the pot no more than 1/4 turn
 and then wait at least 15 seconds for the temperature to stabilize.  Repeat
 this to minimize diode current or maximize output power as noted above.  The
 optimal setting will likely be within a range of 1/4 turn of the pot.
<p>
<li>The KTP TMP can be monitored at J4-11 or J6-11.  The actual temperature
 will be: (-V * 20) + 25 &deg;C.  It should be pretty close to the value listed
 on the cavity cover.  Try adjusting it slightly while monitoring diode
 current (light loop on) or laser output (light loop off).  Response is quite
 rapid, only a few seconds.  As the pot is turned (waiting a few seconds
 between increments), there will be two types of changes: closely spaced
 peaks with a much slower variation in the best value for each peak.  The
 rapid variation is due to the lasing mode moving under the YAG gain curve
 as the effective cavity length changes with temperature.  The broad variation
 is due to the KTP phase matching changing with temperature.  Find the broad
 peak first and then locate the mode peak nearest it's center.  Leave the
 setting centered within that.  For this adjustment, 1/20th of a turn of the
 pot may be significant.
<p>
 It may be useful to move the EO jumper JP2 to the "Disable" position.  This
 turns off any effect of the mode stabilization (EO) loop on KTP temperature
 and will thus prevent it from "competing" with your KTP TMP adjustment.  Once
 the optimal setting is found, move JP2 to "Enable".  The diode current should
 remain more or less unchanged unless the EO loop is misadjusted.
</ul>
<p>
Note that the result could be a local, not global optimization but this is
unlikely if the original settings were close to those listed on the cavity
cover.
<p>
If the KTP TMP setting is far from that listed on the cavity cover, either
someone has played with the adjustment(s) or there is a fault in either the
temperature control loop or temperature monitoring loop.  However, due to
some heating of the KTP due to the intracavity beam, this setting will vary
slightly with laser power.  The optimum LD TMP also isn't constant for a
given cavity but varies with diode current (probably it goes down with
increasing current due to the separation of the actual diode junction and
temperature sensor).  So even if the LD TMP setting doesn't result in maximum
output or lowest diode current, this may be normal.  If either adjustment
has no effect, there is a fault in either the temperature control loop or
temperature monitoring loop.  In the latter case, the most likely cause is
a failure of the driver for the TEC for that loop.
<p>
If the pump diode is weak and you're running at lower than rated power but at
higher diode current, LD Temp may have to be set slightly lower than listed
and KTP Temp slightly higher than listed.  This is due to the fact that the
temperature sensors are not exactly at the diode junction and KTP crystal.
The lower LD Temp setting compensates for the higher current and increased
heating in the diode to maintain the same junction temperature and thus the
same optimal 808 nm wavelength.  The higher KTP Temp setting compensates for
the decreased intracavity power and lower self heating of the KTP to maintain
its temperature at the point for optimal phase matching.
<p>
Small fluctuations in diode current (if the light loop is active with LDI
less than LDIM) or output power (if LDI=LDIM) - typically 5 or 10 percent
but could be much larger (see below) - which occur periodically over a few
seconds or minutes are probably due to the cavity heating and expanding
resulting in mode cycling - just as with a HeNe laser.  In the case of
this ring laser, only one mode should actually
be present but it is drifting across the gain curve of the Nd:YAG crystal and 
then mode hopping back.  Thus the gain is changing.  In addition, the fine
stabilization loop may be losing lock at one extreme or the other resulting
in a sudden increase or decrease in current or power.  Some fine adjustment
of the KTP TMP pot might remedy this if no other pots (like D-AMP) have been
touched.  If they have, you're on your own for now. :)
<p>
Warmup to the point where the mode settles down may take 30 minutes or more.
Be patient and don't be tempted to do any fine tuning before this - you'll
just have to do it all over again.  (I know, the specs say 5 minutes.  Maybe
that's under ideal conditions, whatever they are.)
<p>
More coming.
<p>
(From: Curt Graber (cgraber@fwi.com).)
<P>
Power oscillation is a common problem in the units I have had over the
past couple of years.  Some are much worse than others with the worst unit
seen to date oscillating over 40% of its max power value and usually at a
relatively slow rate (10 to 20 seconds between peaks).
<p>
As noted above, the most critical measurement to make is the board limiting
max diode current (LDIM) on pin 13 of the interface connector.  Make sure it
is well under the diode's max current spec (SDL-2372, which is the original
diode used in these lasers has a spec which is higher than Coherent's spec
for the diode) and measure or graph the power oscillation to determine the
max optical output at whatever the given actual current setting is.
<p>
I worked backwards due to not having the Coherent thermal balance tree
chart.  I'd pull the diode current down from factory setting 10% and using
pump diode TEC driver adjustments (LD TMP) and KTP TEC driver adjustments (KTP
TMP), measure over a period of 10 to 15 seconds and graph the trends to see
where you are at that specific current.
<p>
Because the unit is a optical feedback system, you can use this to your
advantage by setting the optical output setting (PHOTO) low and adjust
the temps of the diode and KTP while watching the current draw to
determine peak emission efficiency of the resonator - kind of like a
built in relative power meter as the operation window will always be
in affect and the current will go down if the resonator efficiency
(read thermal balance improves) and work your way back up.
<p>
I realize not everyone has a Coherent Labmaster or other graphing or
trending meter but you can peak one of these resonators (assuming nothing
is physically wrong with the diode or TEC drivers) using only a DVM on the
kitchen table while the kids are playing PS2 and wife is running for
groceries. ;-)
<p>
If the laser is producing its rated output at a reasonable diode current
and has a good concentric beam shape (simple optic beam on the wall across
the room) depending on the application you might need it for you have
found one of the coolest little DPSS units on the planet!
<p>
I have sold many of them in the past and while the market is down (way
down!) at the moment the coolness factor of a 532-200 is way up there
how many other DPSS units out there have a coherence length of 150 meters?

<h4><A NAME="strc532e">C532 Mode Stabilization (EO) Adjustments</A></h4>

This is a "works in progress" and minor errors or major bloopers are quite
possible at this stage. :)
<p>
The ring cavity of the C532 inherently runs in a single longitudinal mode
but as the cavity length changes due to thermal expansion, the mode will
drift under the gain curve of the YAG crystal.  The slow change in wavelength
and frequency is in itself probably harmless (except to specsmanship!) but
eventually, it will move off one side of the gain curve and hop back to
the other.  The mode stabilization circuitry does the fine tuning to maintain
the single longitudinal mode of the C532 centered on the YAG gain curve.
To put it simply: It wiggles the cavity length by a little bit and sets
the average cavity length so the peak of the power response is centered.
This won't prevent mode hops as the laser cavity undergoes gross changes
during warmup.  But after a few minutes, it will be able to lock the mode
in one place and keep it there.
<p>
In more detail, the theory goes something like this: A low level
dither signal is applied to electrodes on the KTP crystal.  Due to the
piezoelectric effect in KTP, this varies its effective optical length very
slightly.  (The schematics refer to EO, which I am assuming means ElectroOptic
effect.  Although KTP has both phenomena, the EO effect would be much to small
to do anything useful with only a few volts of drive as is the case with the
C532.  However, I will use the abbreviation "EO" below just to reduce the
amount of typing needed!)  As the optical length changes, the single lasing
mode shifts under the Nd:YAG gain curve, and thus the gain and lasing
efficiency also varies.  By detecting the change in laser diode current
required to maintain constant optical power, a feedback loop is used to center
the single longitudinal mode the gain curve.  This will maintain
a very stable wavelength/frequency along with that incredible 150 meter
coherence length.
<p>
The heart of the stabilization control loop is an SE5521 LVDT Signal
Conditioner IC (a Google search will return links to the SE5521 datasheet
and app notes).  The SE5521 includes a stable sinewave RC oscillator and
synchronous demodulator.  That demodulator is the key to the operation of
the EO system as it is able to sort out the very low level AC diode current
signal in a very noisy environment and use it to regulate the KTP
temperature to maintain the lasing mode centered on the Nd:YAG gain curve.
In fact, that noise is much much worse than would be inferred from the
schematics.  It's due to the laser relaxation oscillation inherent in
the lasing process and is orders of magnitude larger than the AC diode
current signal.  More on this below.
<p>
There is an EO signal on J4-3 and J6-7.  This comes from the output of the
AC-coupled leaky integrator attached to the synchronous demodulator output.
It goes through a high value resistor to the KTP temperature setting network.
This signal has much less effect on the KTP temperature than the integrated DC
error but that one has no monitor output or even a testpoint.  I do not
know why the user would want to monitor the EO signal but it might pulse if
mode hops, which should never occur, occur.
<p>
There are 3 pots associated with the EO circuitry: D-AMP, Offset, and Phase.
But, if you know these pots haven't been touched, leave them alone!  It's
unlikely they need to be adjusted at all.  Even if any were twiddled a bit
(say at most a turn or two) accidentally or from curiosity, the settings are
probably still close enough that no substantial change in performance has
occurred.  And since no official procedure is yet known, it may still be best
to leave them alone.  Furthermore, the effect of the EO circuitry on overall
laser output power will be modest - a few percent as long as the laser is
running at a substantial fraction of rated output power (not idling just
above threshold).  Thus, it's really the last set of adjustments to be
considered.  If your laser is outputting 1 mW when it is rated at 200 mW,
this set of adjustments is not the problem!
<p>
In any case, it won't hurt to determine the original setting of each pot
by measuring its resistance before changing it.
<p>
The first procedure is based on theory but before performing it, read the
rest of the section since it probably won't work because the relaxation
oscillation noise will totally swamp anything you can see unless you have
had the syncrhonous demodulator eyeball upgrade. :)
<p>
An oscilloscope will be required to monitor certain selected testpoints:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Allow the laser to warm up at maximum power for at least 20 minutes,
 preferably an hour or more.  This will permit the cavity to reach a stable
 temperature.
<p>
<li>Move jumper JP2 to the "Disable" position.  This turns off any effect of
 the EO feedback loop on the laser output.
<p>
<li>Touch up KTP TMP to minimize diode current (both the phase matching broad
 peak and the mode centering narrow peak within it as described in the section
 on basic testing and adjustments, above).
<p>
<li>Monitor TP18 (Dither Oscillator) and TP19 (AC diode current) on a dual
 trace oscilloscope if one is available.  Adjust D-AMP so there is only a
 single peak/dip on TP19 for each cycle of the signal on TP18.
<p>
<li>Monitor TP22 (Synchronous Demodulator Output) and adjust Phase so that
 the waveform is symmetric about its average value.  There are two possible
 phase settings that will result in this result.  Picking the wrong one will
 result in the loop being unstable and moving away from the center.  If this
 happens after step 7, below, you'll have to go back to chose the other one
 by moving JP6 to the opposite position.  Presumably, if it hasn't been
 touched and the original laser cavity is being used, the setting will be
 correct since it should be determined by the polarity of the KTP effective
 length change with respect to driving voltage - determined by the way it is
 mounted and connected, not something that could change with time.  My guess
 is that this is something that would have been difficult to determine at the
 time of manufacture resulting in a 50:50 chance of the correct phase.  So
 Coherent just decided to provide both options.  This also means that JP6
 shouldn't be moved to match the position on a known good laser just because
 it isn't in the same position.
<p>
<li>Adjust Offset so the voltage on TP16 is the same as the average value
 found on TP22.
<p>
<li>Move jumper JP2 to the "Enable" position.  The EO loop should now be
 active.
<p>
<li>Monitor laser diode current with a DMM.  It should now be at or below the
 value that it had when the KTP TMP pot was adjusted for minimum current.  If
 so, then the EO loop is doing its thing.  If the current has now jumped to a
 slightly higher value, the EO loop is maintaining the mode at exactly the
 wrong place - Phase is probably opposite what it should be so go back and
 try the other position of JP6.
</ol>
<p>
OK, that's what's supposed to work based on studying the schematics.  However,
the laser apparently doesn't fully agree.  Attempting to look at TP19 revealed
a messy high level (at least relative to any expected dither related signal)
oscillation totally uncorrelated with TP18.  Its appearance was affected by the
Light Gain pot but no evidence of the signal I expected could be found by eye
at least.  I believe the rogue signal is just a manifestation of the relaxation
oscillation of the YAG laser cavity and is thus unavoidable.  (Do a Google
search for "laser relaxation oscillation" and you'll spend countless hours
understanding why lasers don't behave as nice textbook oscillators with
constant output power!)  I did check the signal on two samples of the C532
and while not identical, the appearance was similar enough to suggest that
it is normal.  Despite being many orders of magnitude larger than the buried
signal containing the feedback information, the synchronous demodulator is
able to totally ignore it and the EO loop still functions perfectly.  It's a
feature, not a bug. :)
<p>
In any case, here's the ad-hoc procedure for adjusting the EO loop assuming
it needs to be adjusted at all.  None of the settings appears to be the least
bit critical so as already noted, unless someone turned every pot, the EO loop
is probably fine.  NOTE: The following assumes every pot was turned at random.
If the pots haven't been touched, DO NOT TOUCH THEM until the initial tests
have been done.  Then see if small changes improve things.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Allow the laser to warm up at maximum power for at least 20 minutes,
 preferably an hour or more.  This will permit the cavity to reach a stable
 temperature.
<p>
<li>Move jumper JP2 to the "Disable" position.  This turns off any effect of
 the EO feedback loop on the laser output.
<p>
<li>Touch up KTP TMP to minimize diode current (both the phase matching broad
 peak and the mode centering narrow peak within it as described in the section
 on basic testing and adjustments, above).
<p>
<li>Set the D-AMP pot so there is about 2.5 V p-p on TP3 (subject to the note,
 above).  I picked 2.5 V p-p arbitrarily as being large enough to have an
 effect.  A larger or smaller value may have advantages.
<p>
<li>Set the Phase pot to the middle of its range (subject to the note,
 above).
<p>
<li>Set the Offset pot so that there is 0 VDC on TP16 (subject to the note,
 above)..
<p>
<li>Move jumper JP2 to the "Enable" position.  The EO loop should now be
 active.
<p>
<li>Monitor laser diode current with a DMM.  It should now be at or below the
 value that it had when the KTP TMP pot was adjusted for minimum current.  If
 so, then the EO loop is doing its thing.  If the current has now jumped to a
 higher value, the EO loop is maintaining the mode at exactly the wrong place
 - Phase is probably opposite what it should be so go back and try the other
 position of JP6.
</ol>
<p>
With either procedure, fine adjustment may still be needed to optimize
performance but I currently haven't got a clue of what that is or what
signal levels are optimal. :)
<p>
However, to check the settings of Offset and Phase, while monitoring laser
diode current with a DMM, slowly turn the Offset pot incrementally in both
directions (waiting a few seconds for a response) to see if the laser diode
current can be reduced further.  Do the same with the Phase pot.  Go back and
forth between Offset and Phase to see if any further improvement is possible.
For the C532 I adjusted, Offset appeared to have a best position but even
several turns of the Phase pot in either direction had no significant effect.
<p>
As a further confirmation of EO loop operation, move JP2 to the "Disable"
position and turn the KTP TMP just enough so the laser diode current jumps
to a higher value.  Move JP2 to "Enable".  After several seconds, the current
should start to decrease and eventually return to its previous value.  Move
JP2 to "Disable", restore the KTP TMP pot to the minimum diode current
position, move JP2 to "Enable" and it should stay there.
<p>
I find it kind of amazing that the EO loop works at all but it does. :)
<p>
Note that due to the way in which the mode peak is selected by the EO
control loop, the actual laser diode current and lasing efficiency may be
less than seen after the adjustments, above, and may change from one power
cycle to the next, especially if not from a cold start.  I consider this a
deficiency in the design but it doesn't really affect any aspect of
performance seen by the user.  More on why this is so can be found
in the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#sclc532m">C532 Mode Stabilization</A>.
<p>
However, it might be possible to "precompensate" for the expected offset
(though there will still be some randomness) after performing the adjustments,
above: Power off and allow the laser return to ambient temperature (say, an
hour at least).  Power up and allow it to warmup for a minimum of 20 minutes.
Measure the voltage on J4-11 or J6-11 (KTP temperature) and record the
value (EO loop locked).  Move JP2 to "Disable" and record the reading
after it settles down (a few seconds, the optimum value determined above).
Adjust the KTP TMP pot to be offset by the difference in the two readings.
For example, if the locked value after warmup reads out as -0.51 V and
and the optimum value is -0.53 V, adjust the KTP TMP pot to
-0.55 V.  Then move JP2 to "Enable".  Next time the laser is powered up
from a cold start, hopefully it will lock closer to the optimum setting.

procedure, please contact me via the

<h4><A NAME="strc532l">LD Temperature Control Problems</A></h4>

The temperature control loop for the pump diode (laser diode, LD) is quite
simple consisting of a couple of op-amps, a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)
circuit based on the SG/UC2524 PWM IC, a bipolar transistor chopper, and
LC filter network.
<p>
When the laser is first turned on or its output power is changed from low to
high, the normal behavior is for the voltage to the TEC (PEL+) to go to
max (+10 V or more) for perhaps 10 or 20 seconds, then ramp
down to a low value, and climb back to a few volts and stabilize there.  The
output (pin 7) of the LF347 op-amp feeding the PWM IC should
generally track this (but with +5 V max).  Even if LDI is at LDIM (maxed out),
the LD temperature should be under control.  Where the LD TEC isn't able to
maintain the proper temperature, there are several likely situations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms: PEL+ stays at 10 V but LD Temp does not go low enough.
<p>
 Possible causes: Open or damaged TEC, defective sensor, inadequate cooling
 of the laser head (laser diode) heatsink, low thermal conductivity between
 laser diode and heatsink.
<p>
 Testing: Check the resistance of the TEC.  It should be a few ohms.  Check
 that the sensor voltage is changing as the laser warms up.  Make sure the
 the head fan is running and the ambient temperature isn't excessive.
<p>
 If the sensor voltage isn't changing at all but the heatsink is getting
 hot, the sensor or its electronics are defective.  If the heatsink isn't
 getting hot, the TEC may be open (possible bad connection).  However,
 if the pump diode has been replaced, make sure the heat conducting pad
 between it and the case has been installed and that all the bolts are
 installed (the 2 in the back might have been left out due to laziness
 since without special tools, getting to them requires removing the optics
 platform) and are tight (remove the cover and feel the diode case - it
 should be essentially the same temperature as the heatsink).
<p>
 If the temperature changes but doesn't go low enough, try reducing LDI/LDIM
 to just above lasing threshold.  If the temperature now responds and
 stabilizes, then the TEC may be weak (I'm not sure how this could happen) or
 heat transfer to the heatsink is inadequate (see above).  However, there
 should be plenty of reserve even at the maximum possible LDIM.
<p>
<li>Symptoms: PEL+ stays at 0 V but LD Temp is too high.
<p>
 Possible causes: Shorted TEC or defective driver.
<p>
 Testing: Check the resistance of the TEC.  It should be a few ohms.  Check
 the output of the LF347 (pin 7): If it is near 0 V, then it or circuitry
 prior to it is defective.  If it is at 5 V, the PWM IC or the driver
 transistor circuit is bad.
<p>
<li>Symptoms: PEL+ stays at 10 V and LD Temp goes too low.
<p>
 Possible causes: Defective temperature sensor or driver.
<p>
 Testing: Check pin 7 of the LF347.  If it is also max (near +5 V), the
 sensor or associated circuitry is bad.  If it is near 0 V, the PWM IC or
 the driver transistor circuit is bad (shorted).
<p>
<li>Symptoms: PEL+ stays at 0 V but LD Temp goes too low.
<p>
 Possible causes: Your laser must be running in an arctic environment. :)
 Since the TEC is set up to only cool, if the laser diode current is very
 low and the ambient temperature is very very low, it's theoretically possible
 for this to happen, but realistically, it's only theoretically possible!
</ul>
<p>
Of course, there are other scenarios with intermediate and/or incorrect
temperature.

<h3><A NAME="strc532r">Pump Diode Replacement in the Coherent Compass
 532</A></h3>

The following procedure provides step-by-step instructions for replacing
an old, tired, worn out, or totally dead SDL-237x laser diode assembly in
the Coherent Compass 532 series of green DPSS lasers.  It assumes the rest
of the cavity is in good condition and the power supply/controller is
operational.  This applies directly to the 532-100 and 532-200.  Lower
power models use a different pump diode.
<p>
<b>Symptoms of pump diode failure:</b>
<p>
Of course, first make sure the beam shutter is open! :)
<p>
Three main settings determine the operation of the laser: Pump diode current
(LD current), pump diode temperature (LD Temp), and KTP temperature (KTP
Temp).  The rest of the electronics is for fine mode optimization but this
should not have a very strong effect on output power unless the laser is
really in very bad shape.  Thus, if the readings at the interface connector
show proper diode and KTP temperature (settings written on the cavity cover)
with the diode current maxed out, diode failure is very likely.  However, it
is possible for there to be other problems like internal cavity damage or bad
electronics.  The actual diode current should be checked if possible to
confirm that it is indeed excessively high.  If/when the cavity is opened,
measuring the actual pump diode optical output power and wavelength would
also be desirable.  The cavity should be inspected for obvious damage
as well.  (See instructions below for opening the cavity.)
<p>
<b>Availability of replacement pump diodes:</b>
<p>
Replacement pump diode assemblies (including the TE cooler but probably NOT
the collimating lens) may be available from Coherent at prices you don't want
to think about.  However, the original manufacturer is SDL, now part of
<A HREF="http://www.jdsu.com/">JDS Uniphase</A>.  Complete
specifications can be found on their Web site.  Go to "Products", "Commercial
Lasers", "Laser Diodes, and finally "Laser Diode, 790-800 or 808-812 nm,
0.5-4.0 W".  These are the SDL-2300 series of laser diode.  There is a
link to the datasheet on that page.  The pump diode in the 532-200 is
the SDL-2372-P1.
<p>
A pump diode assembly which appears to be compatible is available from Sony
as well and may be much less expensive.  This diode is rated 3 W instead of
2 W so it may be possible to increase the output power of the laser (but no
guarantees and electronics modifications may be needed).  Go to:
<A HREF="http://www.photonics.uk.com/">Photonics Products UK</A>, "Products",
"Infrared Laser Diodes", "Sony", "SLD327YT".
<p>
Note that the SDL-2382, which might seem to be a tempting replacement for the
SDL-2372, is probably not going to provide acceptable performance in a
C532-200 (or lower power laser).  (However, some version of the SDL-2382
may be the diode used in the C532-400.)  The reasons are twofold:
The SDL-2382 has a higher threshold current
(2 A versus 0.9 A) and wider stripe (500 um versus 200 um).  Taken
together, these differences mean that there is no way to get rated
power from a C532-200 with this diode driven by the original
controller.  First, the operating current for the same diode output power
will be about an amp higher.  More importantly, because the stripe of
the SDL-2382 is 2.5X wider than that of the SDL-2372, its brightness
(power per unit solid angle) and thus the power into the lasing mode
of the C532 is actually 2.5X lower for the same diode output power.
Thus, the output of the C532 will be much lower at the same diode
power.  Even at the maximum current of the SDL-2382, the output power
of the C532 will probably not be much higher than with the SDL-2372
and may even be significantly lower.  It might be possible to at least
partially compensate for these shortcomings with changes to the
controller board (or the use of an external laser diode driver), and
changes in the beam shaping optics, but that's for the advanced course
and may not work well given the constraints of the cavity design.
<p>
An alternative that should work is to replace just the C-block laser
diode inside the SDL-2372.  First, follow the procedure below to the
point of removing the bad SDL-2372.  After that, its collimator and
cover are taken off.  See <A HREF="sdl2372x.jpg">SDL-2372 Laser Diode
Assembly with Cover Removed</A>.  It should be a relatively simple
matter to swap in a suitable substitute C-block diode.  It doesn't
have to be an SDL diode, only that it is around 808 nm, has a 200 um
stripe width, and can output about 2 watts with less than 3.5 A.
There are many sources for such diodes.  Setting the position of the
new diode to visually match that of the original should be adequate
since collimator alignment will be needed in any case and that will
compensate for any differences in the location of the diode emitter.
See the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc532rd">Repairing an
SDL-2372 Laser Diode Assembly</A> for details on getting inside.  Once
the transplant is complete, the procedure below for "Case 2" can be
resumed.
<p>
<b>Special requirements/tools:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A modified 7/64" hex wrench will come in handy to permit the pump diode to
 be loosened or tightened without removing the resonator (for adjustment
 purposes).  This needs to have a short arm that is about 1" long -
 slightly longer than that of the standard wrench.  I suggest cutting off
 the long arm of wrench to the appropriate length (confirm once the cavity
 is open) and adding an extension to the short arm to serve as a handle.
 A second ball-end 7/64" hex wrench will come in handy as well.
<p>
<li>Two sizes of security type hex wrenches are needed to disassemble the case
 and gain access to the inside of the cavity, respectively.  Rather than
 breaking off the security pins if a proper wrench isn't available (this
 may be rather abusive to the laser!), I found a really mediocre normal hex
 wrench of the proper size in my junk box and drilled a hole in its center.
 If you only have good quality wrenches which are too hard to drill, heat the
 end red-hot and let it cool slowly to soften for drilling.  Then heat it
 red-hot again and quench in oil to restore the temper.  My wrench was soft
 enough to drill and heat treating wasn't required as the screws weren't that
 tight.  It may also be possible to jam a small flat-blade screwdriver in
 the hex slot and loosen them with that.  I'd recommend using normal Philips
 stainless steel screws (6-32 x 1/2" for the cavity cover and 4-40 x 5/8" for
 the laser cover) upon reassembly.
<p>
<li>A laser power meter will be needed to enable peaking of the output
 power.  It will need to be calibrated for 532 nm to determine if the laser
 meets specifications but anything that reacts to 532 nm light will be
 desirable for peaking if the light loop isn't working or enabled.  If it
 is, diode current can be used for peaking (minimum diode current equates
 to maximum efficiency).
</ul>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> All work should be done at an ESD protected workbench with high
impedance ground connected wrist strap.  The cavity should only be opened
in a dust-free environment.  Yeah, right, so we all have these, correct? :)
<p>
<b>Preparation prior to pump diode removal:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the two screws at the top-front and bottom-rear of the case.
 Separate the two halves of the case by lifting the top straight up and then
 flip it over so that the unit can be powered with access to the adjustment
 pots.  (If it isn't lifted straight up, some of the pots along the edge
 may get bent over or broken off.)
<p>
 WARNING: Avoid contact with the exposed line voltage on the power entrance
 of the power supply!  Put some electrical tape over the exposed terminals
 for safety.
<p>
<li>Confirm that the Light/Current mode jumpers are set to Light Mode.
<p>
<li>Power up the unit and allow 15 to 30 seconds for the LD_OFF LED on the
 controller board to go out.  If the old pump diode still had any life left
 in it, there should now be some green output.
<p>
<li>Monitor the appropriate test points on the interface connector and
 set the following pots on the controller board:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>LDIM (Laser Diode Current Max)</b>: Set to slightly above threshold 
  for the <b>new</b> pump diode (from the test sheet that came with it).  I
  suggest around 1.5 A.  This should be high enough to produce some green
  output assuming the pump spot is reasonably well aligned and the LD and KTP
  temps are approximately correct.  The test point sensitivity is 1 V/A.
<p>
 <li><b>LD TMP (Laser Diode Temperature):</b> Set so the peak of the new diode
  is at 808 nm assuming 0.3 nm/degree C based on the test sheet data.  The
  test point  reads Temperature = (25-V*20) in degrees C.  Thus if your diode
  spec is 810 nm at 25&deg;C, the LD temp should be set at 19&deg;C or +0.3 V.
  This will need to be tweaked later for maximum power but should be close
  enough for initial tests.
<p>
 <li><b>KTP TMP (KTP Temperature):</b> Confirm that it is set at the value
  printed on the cavity cover.   The test point reads Temperature = (25-V*20)
  in degrees C.  Thus if the KTP temp spec is 37&deg;C, reading should be
  -0.6 V.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Power down the unit, disconnect and set aside the top half of the case
 with the power supply/controller.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Cavity access and pump diode removal:</b>
<p>
Precautions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The strong magnet in the YAG crystal assembly will try to suck in
 any ferrous tools or parts that get anywhere near it, likely smashing the
 Brewster angle waveplate in the process and turning the laser into a high
 tech sculpture.  Take care to prevent this from happening!
<p>
<li>When removing and reinstalling the resonator frame (if necessary),
 take care not to abuse the thin fragile wires for the PD and KTP going to the
 bulkhead connector.  They break really easily.
<p>
<li>Do this work in as dust-free an environment as possible.  When not
 actually needing to access the inside of the cavity, cover it to prevent
 dust and debris from entering.
</ul>
<p>
Read over the entire remainder of this section before doing anything!
<p>
<ol>
<li>For non-OEM units, it is possible to do the swap with the cavity
 installed in the lower part of the case but removing it will make things more
 convenient (3 screws from underside).  For OEM units, the cavity should be
 detached from the spacer/hinges and set flat on the work surface.
<p>
<li>Remove the cavity cover by unscrewing the six (6) security hex screws.
<p>
 CAUTION: The YAG assembly metal block near the center of the cavity contains
 a powerful magnet.  Any metal object that gets in its vicinity will
 be sucked toward this block likely smashing the waveplate or other optics
 and rendering the laser useless.  Take extreme care to keep ferrous metal
 tools away from this area.
<p>
<li>Use a hex wrench to remove the two (2) visible screws holding the pump
 diode package.  Set these aside with their lock and flat washers.
<p>
<li>The entire resonator is on a glass and metal frame held to the main body
 of the cavity with two hex nuts from the outside of the heatsink.  While
 holding the frame, use a 1/4" nut driver to remove these two nuts and set them
 aside.  The resonator is now only attached by its wiring.  CAREFULLY tip
 the cavity on its side and free the resonator from the cavity placing it
 on a clean smooth surface.  At the same time, it will probably be best to
 remove the plug to the pump diode and replace it with a shorting jumper
 for at least the 2 LD connections (if you care about its health).  Be
 especially gentle with the wiring to the photosensor and KTP piezo/heater
 which is particularly thin and fragile.
<p>
<li>Use a hex wrench to remove the remaining 2 screws holding the pump diode
 package and set these aside with their lock and flat washers.  There are
 channels cut in the aluminum frame to allow access from underneath.
<p>
<li>Most likely, the pump diode package will still appear to be firmly
 attached to the heatsink due to the indium foil pad underneath it.  Use
 a plastic or wood stick between the package and aluminum frame to free it
 taking care not to let the collimator hit the optics!
 The indium foil pad will probably stay with the pump diode package.  If
 it can be freed intact, it may be reused.  Otherwise, a replacement will
 be needed.  The purpose of the pad is to facilitate heat transfer.  A
 substitute may be possible but it must be something that won't outgas
 and contaminate the optics.
<p>
<li>If the replacement pump diode doesn't include the collimator, carefully
 free it from the old one by chipping away at the adhesive attaching it to the
 old diode.  The collimator consists of two parts - the lens barrel itself
 which is glued inside the flange thing that is actually stuck to the diode
 package.  Hopefully, these two sections won't need to be separated but at
 this point I don't know.  If the actual laser diode chip on the new pump
 is mounted deeper inside the package, it will be necessary to free the two
 sections to be able to achieve a collimated beam.  Set the collimator aside
 in a cushioned box for now.  Store the old pump diode in an antistatic bag
 if you care about it.
</ol>
<p>
The procedure now diverges based on whether the new pump diode has a collimator
pre-installed:
<p>
<b>Installing the new pump diode - Case 1:</b> Collimator is already installed
and aligned as with swapping a diode in from another identical unit.  Note
that I really don't know how likely it is for the alignment between diodes
to be close enough to obtain full power by only
adjusting the diode position; it may be that there really isn't any
interchangeability guaranteed and the full alignment procedure will be
needed.  I have only two data points.  For the first, elongating the holes
in the diode package was enough to obtain 150 mW of output power at rated
diode current but I suspect that this is not optimal.  The alignment on the
second replacement was so far off that part of the pump beam wasn't even
making it through the prism pair and there was no green light at all.
Thus, don't expect them to be interchangeable but a few may be close enough
to get some output.  However, since the more elaborate procedure can be done
after the simpler one without any need to remove the diode a second time, it
is probably worth installing the diode with collimator attached hoping
to get lucky. :)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Install the new pump diode with an indium foil pad using the 4 screws.
 If your new diode already has the collimator (or is from another similar
 laser and has the collimator), then it may be necessary to fine tune the
 diode position to center the spot on the YAG rod.  In this case, tighten
 the screws equally snug but not so tight so as to prevent some movement.
<p>
<li>Remove the shorting jumper (or whatever is present on the new diode) and
 attach the electrical cable.  Make sure it is aligned correctly and pushed
 on completely!!!
<p>
<li>Install the resonator assembly into the cavity casting using the 2
 1/4" hex bolts and tighten snugly.  Its position (which only affects
 beam centering at the laser exit aperture) will be fine tuned later
 once there is a beam.
<p>
<li>Attach the cavity, laser diode, and cavity fan cable to the power
 supply/controller.
<p>
<li>The moment you've been waiting for has arrived!  With your multimeter on
 the LDI test point, power up the laser.  After the 15 to30 second warmup
 period, the LD_OFF LED should go out and the LD current should read what
 you set it to before removing the old diode.  If it isn't close to this
 value or the LD_OFF LED doesn't go out, immediately power down and figure
 out what is wrong!
<p>
 Assuming the current is correct, there should be some dim red light visible
 from the diode, through the beam shaping optics, and hitting the YAG crystal.
 With any kind of luck, there may be at least some, perhaps a lot, of green
 light.  However, with the resonator frame not aligned in the cavity casting,
 the output beam may not make it out of the cavity so there may be no output
 beam or one that is totally messed up.  In this case, loosen the two 1/4"
 nuts very slightly and shift the position of the resonator until the beam
 is centered in the output aperture, then tighten the nuts securely.
<p>
 CAUTION: In order for there to be efficient heat transfer from the pump diode
 to the heatsink, the diode mounting screws and 1/4" resonator nuts must all
 be reasonably tight.  It is possible that since the diode is now not firmly
 secured (so it can be moved slightly for alignment) that the TE cooler may be
 incapable of maintaining the selected temperature.  It is important to watch
 out for a thermal runaway condition by monitoring the LD TMP test point and
 switch off power if things get out of hand.
<p>
 If there is no green light, not even a flash, it may be that the temperature
 of the KTP is too far off.  (This would only likely be the case where the pot
 had been moved from the optimal setting for <i>this</i> laser head.
 Replacing the pump diode won't affect KTP TMP setting significantly.)
 Try again with KTP TMP a few degrees warmer or
 cooler.  The range which includes the optimal lasing point is typically
 located between 30 &deg;C and 45 &deg;C.  (There's
 another range where there will be some green output about
 20 &deg;C to 30 &deg;C lower as well but that is not the best one.)
 The response to LD TMP is broad and probably won't prevent lasing if
 set even fairly far away from optimal but the KTP TMP can be critical.
<p>
<li>Adjust LD TMP to center the pump diode's wavelength around 808 nm
 based on the test data received with the diode and a sensitivity of 0.3 nm
 per &deg;C.  If it was far away from 808 nm, output power may increase
 significantly.  Note that this setting is somewhat dependent on pump current
 so it should be checked and adjusted as needed.
<p>
<li>CAREFULLY locate the pump spot on the YAG crystal.  It should appear
 reasonably centered.  Move the diode around within the freedom of the screw
 holes to see if output power can be maximized within the available adjustment
 range or if it appears to be maxed out at one extreme.  If the "sweet spot"
 appears to be within the adjustment range, there is a good chance that no
 further pump alignment is needed.  However, again, I don't know how good the
 consistency is among these lasers and their collimated pump diodes.
<p>
 (It may be that there isn't enough clearance in the pump diode mounting
 holes to center the spot.  In this case, power down the laser and either
 carefully remove the diode from the resonator frame and enlarge them with
 a reamer or jeweler's file, or (much preferred) go to the procedure below
 which uses the collimator lens assembly to adjust the pump diode beam
 position and shape.)
<p>
<li>Once the best position has been found, inspect the beam spot shape.
 While even the beam from a new C532 may not be perfectly circular, the
 beam here shouldn't be 3 times taller than it is wide.  If it is very
 elliptical, the cause may be that the collimating optics are not optimal
 and the full procedure below will be needed to obtain maximum output.
 If it looks decent or you really aren't up to that, continue with this one.
<p>
<li>Power down the laser.  Without disturbing the pump diode position, securely
 tighten the 4 screws in several increments using an alternating X pattern
 (like tightening wheel lug nuts).
<p>
<li>Power up the laser and confirm that the output power hasn't changed
 significantly after tightening the diode.
<p>
 Note that since the heat transfer is different after tightening, some
 portion of any change that occurred may be due to a change in diode
 temperature and it can be confusing to sort out.
<p>
<li>Once the best position is found, slowly increase the LD current to to more
 than 2 to 2.5 A.  Readjust LD TMP in small increments (e.g., 1/4 turn) to see
 if power can be increased - wait a minute or so between adjustments to allow
 time for the LD temperature to stabilize.  Check for optimal KTP temperature
 - with the new diode, the intracavity beam shape will be different and this
 may affect the KTP TMP setting.
<p>
 Note that since Light Mode is enabled, if other electronic adjustments
 haven't been touched, the feedback loop will start regulating once the
 output power exceeds the set point (200 mW for this model unless it was
 adjusted for something else).  In this case, the LDIM pot will not increase
 current above what is required.  Should you be very lucky and hit this
 before 2 A, don't keep turning - for now, set the pot to a point just beyond
 where the current stops increasing (1 turn or so).
<p>
 CAUTION: Under NO circumstances should the LD Current be set above the
 diode's rated value.  If that is needed to achieve adequate output power,
 something else is wrong.  Check the LD and KTP temperature settings and
 that the feedback loops are working, the cavity for damage, etc.
<p>
<li>Replace the cavity cover, tightening the 6 screws in small
 increments in an alternating pattern (like an engine cylinder head).
 If possible, the cavity should be purged with dry nitrogen (I assume)
 using the two ports provided for this purpose but if you have none, don't
 lose sleep over it. :)
<p>
<li>Perform the electrical alignment procedure to optimize cavity mode
 stability.
<p>
<li>Record the new LDI OPT, LDI Rated, LDIM, LD TMP, and KTP TMP on the cavity
 cover label.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Installing the new pump diode - Case 2:</b> This set of steps deals with the
situation where the new diode didn't come with a collimator, or a suitable
position cannot be found for a diode with a pre-glued collimator.  (Skip to
step 5 if the previous procedure has already been done.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Install the new pump diode with an indium foil pad using the 4 screws.
 If there is no collimator, then the diode position isn't as critical since
 fine alignment will be done with the collimator.  In this case, just center
 the diode (there isn't that much clearance in any case).  Tighten the 4
 screws securely in 3 or 4 increments using an X pattern (like wheel lug
 nuts!).
<p>
<li>Remove the shorting jumper (or whatever is present on the new diode) and
 attach the electrical cable.  Make sure it is aligned correctly and pushed
 on completely!!!
<p>
<li>Install the resonator assembly into the cavity casting using the 2
 1/4" hex bolts and tighten snugly.  Its position (which only affects
 beam centering at the laser exit aperture) will be fine tuned later
 once there is a beam.
<p>
<li>Attach the cavity, laser diode, and cavity fan cable to the power
 supply/controller.
<p>
<li>It's time to apply power!  With your multimeter on the LDI test point,
 power up the laser.  After the 15 to 30 second warmup period, the LD_OFF LED
 should go out and the LD current should read what you set it to before
 removing the old diode.  If it isn't close to this value or the LD_OFF
 LED doesn't go out, immediately power down and figure out what is wrong!
<p>
 Assuming the current is correct, there should be a widely divergent beam of
 dim red light from the aperture of the pump diode.  Confirm with a white
 card if it isn't obvious.  DON'T look into the diode aperture from the front!
 Turn the LDIM pot down until the red light is just barely visible, just
 above threshold for the diode.  This will permit the collimator to be
 positioned without risk of burning/damaging anything.
<p>
<li>Adjust LD TMP to center the pump diode's wavelength around 808 nm
 based on the test data received with the diode and a sensitivity of 0.3 nm
 per &deg;C.  If it was far away from 808 nm, output power may increase
 significantly.  Note that this setting is somewhat dependent on pump current
 so it should be checked and adjusted as needed.  If wavelength data is not
 available, set LD TMP to 15 &deg;C.
<p>
<li>Since the required collimation is not typically consistent among
 C532s, the best approach is probably to assume that focus adjustment
 will also be needed.  There is a small chance that the collimation of
 the original and replacement diodes is the same but apparently even this
 may not be likely.  However, it won't hurt to try the existing focus just
 in case.  Skip the next paragraph and see if there is any green output
 by using the collimator at the existing setting flush against the laser
 diode front surface.  If it is correct, the added complication of focus
 adjustment can be avoided.  If the collimator needs to be a bit off of
 the surface of the diode package for best performance, a shim with a
 hole in it can be installed under the collimator to adjust the focus.
 If neither is satisfactory, then the collimating lens assembly will
 have to come apart. 
<p>
 The collimating lens assembly consists of an inner barrel with a single
 short focal length lens mounted close to the diode-end which slides
 within an outer barrel with its flange against the diode package.  Use
 a piece of aluminum or other soft scrap to remove the adhesive holding
 the two barrels together, as well as any adhesive that is still on the
 assembly.  Ideally, a 5-axis micropositioner would be used to adjust the
 inner barrel for best performance while the outer barrel is free.  Then,
 the outer barrel would be attached with UV cure adhesive to the laser diode
 package, and finally the inner barrel would be fastened to the outer
 barrel, also with UV cure adhesive.  If a micropositioner is available,
 by all means use it.  However, an alternative which will work is
 to construct a clamp using a piece of thin aluminum with a cushion
 to hold the outer barrel in such a way that it can be moved on the laser
 diode package but tight enough that it will stay in place either permanently,
 or long enough for adhesive to be applied:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Replace the two cap-head diode package holding screws that are visible
  with threaded standoffs that are the height of the laser diode package or
  long cap-head screws and non-threaded standoffs (the first being preferred
  since loosening the screws to adjust the collimator position doesn't affect
  the diode mounting).  Construct a clamp with two fingers from a thin
  metal plate.  Allow enough clearance between the fingers so that the
  collimator can be moved a millimeter or so both ways.  Put heat shrink
  tubing over the fingers to provide a cushion.  Screw the plate in to
  clamp the flange of the outer barrel.
<p>
 <li>Slightly deform the outer barrel of the collimating lens assembly in
  three places with a pair of needle nose pliers just enough so that the
  fit into the inner barrel is snug.
 </ul>
<p>
 An example of this is shown in
 <A HREF="c532dcc1.jpg">C532 Cavity With Laser Diode Collimator Clamp</A>.
 The modified wooden cloth's pin was an essential tool for fishing out
 the collimator assembly when it dropped from the clamp! :)
<p>
 Then the outer barrel can be moved on the surface of the diode package,
 and  inner barrel and lens can be moved in and out, and rocked
 (yaw and pitch) to obtain the higher output power and best beam shape.  Both
 barrels can then be fastened with adhesive if desired.
<p>
<li>Power up the laser and set the LD Current so that the output of the diode
 is just visible (no more than 1.5 A).  There should be some dim red light
 visible from the diode, through the beam shaping optics, and hitting the YAG
 crystal.  Use the positioner (or your hand) to manipulate the collimating
 lens so the pump beam is centered on the input face of the YAG crystal 
 and for the smallest spot diameter.  It's probably best to first concentrate
 on its position on the diode package with the inner barrel and thus the
 lens against the surface, and then to worry about focus.  However, rough
 focus may be needed first to be able to see where the spot it on the
 face of the YAG crystal.
<p>
 CAUTION: Make sure the bottom of the lens can't contact the surface and
 get scratched.  The ones I've seen were slightly recessed but that may
 not always be the case.
<p>
 With any kind of luck, there may be at  least some, perhaps a lot, of green
 light.  However, with the resonator frame not aligned in the cavity casting,
 the output beam may not make it out of the cavity so there may be no output
 beam or one that is totally messed up.  In this case, loosen the two 1/4"
 nuts very slightly and shift the position of the resonator until the beam
 is centered in the output aperture, then tighten the nuts securely.
<p>
 Note: I'm not absolutely sure that minimum spot size is the optimal setting.
 Try it on either side of this if possible and leave it in the position that
 results in highest output power and best beam shape (probably a bit taller
 than it is wide but not widely elliptical).
<p>
 CAUTION: It's possible that too good a focus isn't good for the YAG crystal
 either so there is some risk here.
<p>
 If there is no green light, not even a flash, it may be that the temperature
 of the KTP is too far off.  (This would only likely be the case where the pot
 had been moved from the optimal setting for <i>this</i> laser head.
 Replacing the pump diode won't affect KTP TMP setting significantly.)
 Try again with KTP TMP a few degrees warmer or
 cooler.  The range which includes the optimal lasing point is typically
 located between 30 &deg;C and 45 &deg;C.  (There's
 another range where there will be some green output about
 20 &deg;C to 30 &deg;C lower as well but that is not the best one.)
 The response to LD TMP is broad and probably won't prevent lasing if
 set even fairly far away from optimal but the KTP TMP can be critical.
<p>
<li>Once the best position is found, slowly increase the LD current to to more
 than 2 to 2.5 A.  Readjust LD TMP in small increments (e.g., 1/4 turn) to see
 if power can be increased - wait a minute or so between adjustments to allow
 time for the LD TMP to stabilize.  Check for optimal KTP temperature - with
 the new diode, the intracavity beam shape will be different and this may
 affect the KTP TMP setting.
<p>
 Note that since Light Mode is enabled, if other electronic adjustments
 haven't been touched, the feedback loop will start regulating once the
 output power exceeds the set point (200 mW for this model unless it was
 adjusted for something else).  In this case, the LDIM pot will not increase
 current above what is required.  Should you be very lucky and hit this
 before 2 A, don't keep turning - for now, set the pot to a point just beyond
 where the current stops increasing (1 turn or so).
<p>
 CAUTION: Under NO circumstances should the LD Current be set above the
 diode's rated value.  If that is needed to achieve adequate output power,
 something else is wrong.  Check the LD and KTP temperature settings and that
 the feedback loops are working, the cavity for damage, etc.
<p>
<li>Assuming output power is satisfactory, use three dabs of quick setting
 adhesive to fix the collimator (and lens barrel if separate) in position.
 Take care not to drip anything on the optics including the laser diode
 window!  (Put the dabs at the 2, 6, and 10 O'clock positions.)  DO NOT
 use cyanoacrylic (Super Glue) as this outgases and messes up optics!!!
 5 minute or UV cured Epoxy is probably best.  Check that the output
 power is about the same as the glue cures.  Most glue shrinks a bit
 so some fine adjustment may be needed.
<p>
<li>Replace the cavity cover, tightening the 6 screws in small
 increments in an alternating pattern (like an engine cylinder head).
 If possible, the cavity should be purged with dry nitrogen (I assume)
 using the two ports provided for this purpose but if you have none,
 don't lose sleep over it. :)
<p>
<li>Perform the electrical alignment procedure to optimize cavity mode
 stability.
<p>
<li>Record the new LDI OPT, LDI Rated, LDIM, LD TMP, and KTP TMP on the cavity
 cover label.

<p>
Congratulations!  You've performed a minor miracle. :)

<h4><A NAME="strc532p1">Sam's Experience with a C532 Pump Diode
 Transplant 1</A></h4>

I was able to at least partially restore a C532 by installing the pump diode
from one with a damaged cavity, where the waveplate had been smashed by the
light loop photodiode falling off and being sucked into the magnet of the
YAG crystal assembly.  The laser being repaired suffered from a total pump
diode and 5 VDC power supply failure.  I'm not sure which happened first but
the the pump diode was totally dead - not even any LED emission and the 12 V
to 5 V DC-DC converter had its output shorted and was thus also quite dead.
<p>
I used the simplified "Case 1" procedure, above.  I do not know for sure how
healthy the replacement pump diode was, but it may be close to new specs since
the laser failed for reasons other than old age.  Perhaps it was dropped. :(
Pump diode adjustments were performed just above threshold (output of a
few mW) by limiting diode current using the LDIM pot, then turning it back
up and using the light loop to maintain output power constant at rated diode
current:
<p>
<ul>
<li>At first, I just installed the replacement pump diode and positioned it
 by hand for maximum light output at fixed current.  It wasn't quite possible
 to adjust the diode position to center the pump spot on the YAG crystal
 face but I was so happy with any decent green light (I thought it was only
 about 40 mW at the time lacking a calibrated laser power meter) that I
 wasn't about to press my luck.
<p>
<li>About a year later, after measuring the power output at 83 mW using a
 Coherent Lasercheck wand, I decided to see if I could improve this by
 properly positioning the pump diode.  After all, 83 mW isn't a particularly
 round number. :)  So, I removed the pump diode and enlarged its mounting
 holes.  Adjusting by eye resulted in an output of 135 mW at rated diode
 current!
<p>
<li>After a long walk in the rain, I decided to readjust the pump position
 using a laser power meter to peak the output at a fixed diode current.  This
 resulted in 150 mW at rated diode current.
</ul>
<p>
A bit more might be possible with more time and care in adjustment but going
inside the cavity with steel tools always entails some risk and exposing the
cavity to my not exactly cleanroom conditions probably results in some gradual
loss of power due to dust getting on the everything that it shouldn't be on.
<p>
I still believe there is much more headroom and that it would be possible
to achieve the laser's rated output (200 mW) at rated diode current or even
at the lower operating current spec of the diode.  However, this would
likely require using the "Case 2" procedure whereby the collimating optics
are removed from the diode case and adjusted using a multiaxis
micropositioner.  This conclusion is due to the observed beam shape being more
elliptical than normal even with my "optimal" positioning.  The pump beam is
probably not hitting the YAG crystal with the correct focus/divergence
and/or angle.  I'm not really ready to do the full procedure, so it will
have to remain at 150 mW for now.  150 mW is still pretty darn bright. :)

<h4><A NAME="strc532p2">Sam's Experience with a C532 Pump Diode
 Transplant 2</A></h4>

I was asked to check out and repair a C532 that had been worked on by
someone else in a partially completed transplant effort.  This section
actually discusses more than just pump diode replacement but that is
the main event.
<p>
The good news is that the electronics now appears to work correctly and there
is green light.  The bad news is that I don't know at this point if it will
be possible to get more than 50 to 75 mW at 3.0 A of pump diode current (which
is as high as I dare go since the specs of the diode are not available.
<p>
I'm testing the C532 on my home-built control panel so I can easily
monitor the LD current, and LD and KTP temperatures.
<p>
When first powered up, neither the LD or KTP TECs were working.  The problem
with the KTP TEC was that the wires inside the head attached to the
bulkhead connector had broken off, no doubt due to repeated flexing
from removing and reinstalling the resonator frame.  This became obvious
by measuring the voltage output from the op-amp driver (which was changing
as expected) and then the resistance of the KTP TEC+ and KTP TEC- on
the controller PCB connector (which was open).
<p>
The LD TEC problem was even simpler - the tabs on the pin inserts in the
connector shell to the controller PCB were pressed in so the inserts popped
out and weren't making contact with the PCB pins.
<p>
Once that was sorted out, the LD and KTP Temp pots had the expected effect.
KTP Temp response is very fast with little overshoot as expected.  The LD
response is slow (as expected) and there is substantial overshoot for large
changes.  I'm not sure if this is normal as it seems to be a bit worse than
I recall but the temperature set-point is reached eventually.
<p>
I set LD Temp to 15 &deg;C and KTP Temp to 35 &deg;C since these are
close to the values I've found for several C532s I've tested in the past.
The pump diode was run at 2.0 A (via the LDIM pot) with absolutely no green
output.
<p>
Examining the pump beam closely, a serious alignment problem was immediately
apparent as there was no nice red spot on the input
face of the YAG crystal and a portion of the pump beam wasn't even
getting through the first prism in the pair!  Thus, removing the collimator
lens assembly was essential - there is no where near enough adjustment range
of the pump diode package even by elongating its mounting holes.
A single-edge razor blade easily peeled off the adhesive freeing
the collimator lens assembly.  Some careful positioning by hand resulted
in some green light within a minute but it didn't make it out of the
laser since the entire resonator frame was too low.  Using my 3 hands,
(1 to hold the the lens assembly in place, 1 to deal with the holding
screws, and 1 to reposition the resonator frame), the beam was easily
centered on the output window.
<p>
Once this was done, I could use one of my spare hands to fine tune the
KTP and LD TECs.  The optimal settings at 2 A of diode current were found
to be: LD TEC, 17.3 &deg;C (0.378 V) and KTP TEC, 42.5 &deg;C (-0.88 V).
These were readings from my control panel and may be in error by a few
percent but should be close enough for Government work. :)  The KTP
TEC setting will not change much with respect to LD current but is
quite critical - 0.1 &deg;C on either side will change output power
very significant.  The response of output power with respect to KTP
Temp is that of a periodic function where the highest peak is around
42.5 &deg;C.  More than a few &deg;C away from the optimal point, there
was no green light at all at 2.0 A of LD current.  The LD Temp will need
to be readjusted slightly depending on LD current.  But the response is
broad so it's really not that critical.
<p>
While a 5-axis positioner would be better, adjusting the collimator alignment
by hand really wasn't bad but there was no way to easily lock it in place.  For
testing, I'm using two strips of masking tape to hold the lens.  This is
satisfactory just to see what's going on but there is enough creep that
even if adjusted for maximum output, it starts to decay immediately and
continues to do so until power is very low.
<p>
The collimating lens assembly consists of an outer barrel with a flange
against the laser diode case and an inner barrel that loosely slides
inside of the outer barrel.  What I intend to do is to construct a clamp
that will press the bottom flange to the laser diode case.  This will
allows its position to be adjusted precisely enough.  Removing the adhesive
locking the inner to the outer barrel will permit the inner barrel and
thus the actual lens to be moved in and out, and rocked slightly (yaw and
pitch).  I constructed the clamp gizmo described in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strc532r">Pump Diode Replacement in the C532</A>
which allowed the pump beam alignment to be adjusted reasonably easily.
It is shown in <A HREF="c532dcc1.jpg">C532 Cavity With Laser Diode
Collimator Clamp</A>.  The collimator alignment is probably within 10
percent of optimal efficiency and the output beam shape looks good.
<p>
However, I'm not optimistic about getting much more than 85 mW at 3 A of diode
current (as high as I dare go without knowing the diode specs).  I did try to
clean some of the optics but if anything, this had no effect or made things
worse.  There is no serious amount of scattered green light inside the cavity
which would be a symptom of dirty optics but I have not checked for IR scatter.
Of course, this problem could still be that one of the 6 intracavity surfaces I
<i>didn't</i> attempt to clean is at fault!)  The beam is
clean and round with minimal scatter.  I haven't actually measured
diode power but the output of the diode looks uniform across the
stripe which would indicate that there not likely to be any major damage.
I will probably make a more serious attempt at cleaning.

<h4><A NAME="strc532pc">Curt's Comments on C532 Pump Diode Replacement
 and Other Issues</A></h4>

(From: Curt Graber (cgraber@fwi.com).)
<p>
After many additional attempts I did get the Sony pump to work
eventually and have now completed several diode replacements with good
results.
<p>
What I have found in the latest work in these units is just how
critical the spot location in fact is (-; and just how dirty the
optics of most of these units are, a simple cleaning and thermal
balance revived many of the units I have at the moment and many of
them were previously opened by someone (Coherent Service Possibly) any
guess as to the pump down ad fill gas they used originally?
<p>
I don't clean the hidden (Brewster angle cut end) end of the yag rod but
a simple single swipe method of a snipped sterile q-tip proves very
good on the visible surface.  Make sure you go open side of the magnet
to closed side so as not to drag debris from the magnet surface to the
face of the rod.
<p>
If the cleaning makes things worse then try a fresh squeeze of alcohol
from your sealed bottle and I use the sterile swabs only once in one
direction and snap and toss it.
<p>
I know the inside angle surface of the YAG is likely robbing me of some
photon's on many of these units but I don't see any option to clean it
short of a bit of sterile canned air and that I'm afraid might kick up
a torrent of death and make things worse so I have just dismissed the
concept of a 100% full clean job.
<p>
It is also amazing to see just how different these units were built
over the years with at least (5) or so position changes of discrete
components documented and many different specific set-ups and even a
couple with different wiring and cable ends terminated.
<p>
It is obvious at this point the reason for so many problems with these
resulted from the different hands building the units on the line and
many revision changes of the units themselves and the fact the
resonator plate was built up and supported only in the center of the
assembly by as little 12 mm of Epoxy, a little vertical high g shock
and the plate exploded into fragments...
<p>
I have had no success in dissolving the adhesive used to mount the components
inside the cavity but on many of them, you can put torsional stress on the
mount and the units pop with near perfect success rate (only lost one of more
than a dozen as of yet) and then re-align and set with Norland or other UV
quick set adhesive.
<p>
I found three of the units with open TEC circuit internal to the diode
(poor quality control at SDL??) as the driver boards drive signal is clean
and in spec.   I could peel open the can and attempt a repair for another
project pump option I guess.  The diodes are all within spec on output versus
current but without temperature control of the diode the wavelength was
completely out to lunch.
<p>
Trying one of the CASIX DPM1102 crystal sets on one of the -50 units which
was completely destroyed so far looks great with 82 mW of 532 output with
under 1 A to the SDL-2362 diode at 900 mW or so pump power and no temperature
control of the crystal set as yet (should be easy with the on-board TEC
driver and thermister circuit).  Any idea what to do with the little RF
driver circuit to the piezo crystal? I guess I could just leave it
attached to the crystal and tied up out of the way.  (Yep. --- sam.)
<p>
I kept the pump diode and shaping wedges and even the first HR in the
arrangment and milled up a cute little crystal set holder and used the
Compass final telescope optic and IR filter and it makes a pretty good
end-pump arrangment albeit without the beam character of the ring cavity
and LOOONG coherence length of the original compass resonator now in
roughly 10,000 pieces at the hand of a Titan lab tech with equivalent
attitude. (-;
<p>
Also found several of the older units wired with the TEC for the KTP backwards
and runing at -700 mV to get the crystal near peak temperature.  I guess the
driver circuit is bi-polar, bi-directional, or bi-ingineered by
distraught onslaught of line-tech, imagine that. (-; (But the controller
wiring would have also had to be reversed. --- Sam.)

<h4><A NAME="strc532rd">Repairing an SDL-2372 Laser Diode Assembly</A></h4>

When I installed a replacement diode in the C532 as described above, the
original broken diode presented an irresistible challenge to repair.  It
was obviously badly traumatized as the innards were just rattling around
inside the case.  The original symptoms were that while the diode still lased
and resulted in over 50 mW of output from the C532, it was impossible to
control the diode temperature.  Eventually, it fell apart completely and no
longer even lased.  That's when the laser was sent to me for repair.
<p>
After removing the collimator lens assembly (transferred to the replacement
diode), I clamped the SDL-2372 in a vice and filed off the top edges on the
3 sides not blocked by the pins.  This allowed the cover to be peeled up, at
which point the forth side came free.  At first I thought the cover was
soldered but no reasonable amount of heat softened the bond, thus the filing
approach.  The cover and window were intact and could be replaced using glue
when the job was done.
<p>
With the cover off, the problems became obvious: The block on which the diode
was mounted had broken free from the TEC.  Initially, this would simply
result in poor thermal contact and thus the inability to cool it effectively.
But eventually, the solder came loose between the package pins and the
laser diode, thermistor, and monitor photodiode.
<p>
It looked like the bond between the diode block and TEC was made with low
temperature solder.  It may have been done before the C-block laser diode
was attached to avoid thermal damage to the laser diode.  For repair, I
decided to use silver Epoxy instead.  While the thermal resistance might
be a bit higher, it would be a lot easier to do without fear of overheating
something.  Once the Epoxy had set (24 hours), the pins could be resoldered.
The laser diode was then cleaned with pure acetone to remove any traces
of solder (flux) smoke residue.
<p>
See <A HREF="sdl2372x.jpg">SDL-2372 Laser Diode Assembly with Cover Removed</A>
<p>
I have tested the repaired diode with results as follows:
<p>
<PRE>
                 Power Output (mW) at a current of (A):
  Threshold (A)     1.00  1.50  2.00  2.50  3.00  3.50
 -------------------------------------------------------
     0.95            30    390   740  1100* 1460* 1820*
</PRE>
<p>
There may be a +/-10 percent measurement error.  When my LaserCheck
starts smoking due to the high power, I tend not to leave it in the
beam too long. :)  Those values marked with "*" were estimated.
While it's obvious from the beam pattern that this diode has
suffered some damage from use or abuse, it actually still is within
the range of acceptable specifications - at the low end to be sure
but it should be quite usable.
<p>
For the measurements, the temperature was maintained at 20 &deg;C with
no difficulty using the TEC.  Of course, the real test will come when run
at higher power but there doesn't seen to be any problem with the TEC or
the use of the silver Epoxy.
<p>
Had the laser diode itself been beyond repair, a standard C-block 2 W 200 um
808 nm laser diode from any manufacturer could have been installed.  Since
the monitor photodiode is not used in the C532, any difficulty in
transferring that device to the new diode could be avoided entirely
(though this may be a non-issue as the photodiode looks like it is
actually part of the mounting assembly, not the C-block).  Positioning
of the replacement C-block diode by eye is adequate as any differences
in emitting location will be handled by the collimator alignment procedure.
 
<h3><A NAME="strc532w">Replacing a Damaged Waveplate in the C532</A></h3>

One of the common ways for a C532 to fail is for the light loop photodiode
to break free from its adhesive and fly into the magnet of the Faraday
rotator, part of the YAG crystal assembly.  (OK, perhaps it's not that
common and would likely require that the laser experienced a hard landing
but I've seen it twice in not that many samples.)  When this happens, the thin
waveplate almost certainly shatters.  Unless a shard just happens to remain
in the beam path, two things occur:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The laser output goes way down (probably below 1 mW) and may split into
 several spots due to the misalignment of the cavity that results.
<p>
<li>The unidirectional ring is no longer unidirectional resulting in mode
 competition and reduced stability.
</ul>
<p>
While I don't know absolutely positively what the parameters of this optic
are, I believe it is a waveplate that is 1/2 lambda at 1,064 nm when oriented
at the Brewster angle.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest solution would be to find a large enough piece of the original
 plate in the debris that falls out of the damaged laser cavity when it is
 opened.  Only a small piece is needed - less than 1x1 mm since the beam
 diameter at that point is very narrow.  However, whatever material it is
 made of must be quite brittle, more so than glass despite its similar
 appearance to a microscope cover slip, since what remained of the
 laser I disassembled was more like sand with no pieces of any significant
 size except what remained glued to its mount.  But I've heard of others
 where the piece broke off more or less intact.  If there is enough there,
 it would be best to use it since the orientation is known and orientation
 is critical (see below).
<p>
<li>Another possibility is to order a waveplate from an optics supplier.  The
 difficulty with this solution is that not only must it be spec'd for 1/2
 lambda for 1,064 nm at the Brewster angle, the beam shift it introduces due
 to its thickness and index of refraction must match up as well to restore
 cavity alignment.  This isn't an insurmountable problem but it would require
 some careful selection and possibly discussions with the supplier.
<p>
<li>A final option is to rip the waveplate from a C532 cavity which is
 certifiably dead for other reasons (like a damaged YAG crystal) and can't
 reasonably be repaired.
</ul>
<p>
Once a suitable replacement can be found, it can be glued to a thin plate
which in turn can be glued to the original mount, or it can be glued directly
to the mount, or to the remains of the old waveplate.  This will set the angle
with respect to the intracavity beam.  However, the orientation of the
must match up to what it was originally.  It's probably rotating the
polarization by only a few degrees but the exact value will be critical
since it must exactly counter the polarization in the opposite direction
introduced by the Faraday rotator.  In principle, this could be tested for
by (temporarily) mounting the plate such that rotation is possible and then
adjusting for best performance - for maximum output power and/or minimum
backwards traveling green light in the KTP.
<p>
If partially restoring the laser (at least temporarily) is desired, simply
using a microscope cover slip of similar thickness to the waveplate
may achieve a substantial fraction of the original output power, though
the incredible stability and coherence length of the C532 won't be
possible.

<h2>JDS Uniphase SLM uGreen 532 nm DPSS Laser</h2>
<h3><A NAME="strjuugt">Troubleshooting of the uGreen DPSS Laser</A></h3>

A general description and operating info on this laser can be found in the
section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#scljuug">JDS Uniphase SLM uGreen 532 nm DPSS
Laser</A>.
<p>
Here are some suggestions for determining if a non-lasing uGreen is caused
by a faulty controller or laser head.
<p>
Assuming the jumper between pins 2 and 6 of the DB15 connector is
installed and DC power is present and has adequate current capability, the
following events should take place:
<p>
<ul>
<li>After 5 to 10 seconds, an internal relay clicks and the laser comes on
 in constant current mode.  There will likely be a beam at this point but
 depending on the unit, it may be very weak or variable.
<p>
<li>During the next 2 or 3 minutes, the TECs for the laser diode and laser
 cavity are powered and the temperature stabilizes.  DC supply current
 may peak at 5 A or more and then declines once the temperatures stabilize and
 the current to the TECs is throttled back.
<p>
<li>Once the temperatures are stable (or after a fixed delay, don't know
 which), the controller switches to constant light mode.  The laser output
 will increase rather quickly to the specified or maximum power if it can
 be achieved within the maximum limit of laser diode current.
</ul>
<p>
If the laser shuts down for no apparent reason, double check that connections
are secure and that the DC power supply has adequate current capability and
decent regulation.  (If a PC KB cable is used for DC power, it may not
be quite as good as the originally spec'd type resulting in erratic contact
and excessive voltage drop due to the thin wires in the KB cable.)
<p>
If the relay clicks but there's no sign of a beam, here are some quick tests
to determine if the problem is likely in the controller or laser head.  These
will require gaining access to the connections at one end of the cable (I
assume the laser head-end for the pins below.  Refer to the section:
<A HREF="laserscl.htm#scljuugw">uGreen Controller to Laser Head Wiring</A>
for additional connection information) and there is some slight risk
of damage making measurements on the laser diode.  Follow antistatic
precautions!
<p>
<ul>
<li>With power OFF, securely attach a multimeter on the DCV range to the laser
 diode (pins 13 and 15 of the head connector).  When you power it up, once the
 relay clicks, there should be 1.5 to 2 VDC on the laser diode indicating
 that it is being powered.  After a couple minutes, the voltage may jump by
 a few tenths of a volt indicating that the controller has attempted to enter
 constant light mode (which of course won't work if there is no output.)
 As soon as the reading is confirmed, power down and carefully remove the
 meter leads from the laser diode connections.
<p>
<li>Attach the multimeter to TEC1 (pins 12 and 7 of the head connector) and
 power up.  The reading should initially go high (+ or - depending on
 connections and whether it's cooling or heating) and then slowly decrease
 to a fairly low steady voltage.  This indicates that the TEC1 temperature
 loop is probably working.  Power down.
<p>
<li>Repeat for TEC2 (pins 8 and 11 of the head connector).
<p>
<li>Remove the laser head cover (4 hex screws).  Power up the laser and
 turn the lights out.  Once the relay clicks, there should be some faint
 deep red light visible between the first block (the laser diode) and
 second block (the laser cavity).  This indicates that the laser diode is
 probably not totally dead though there is no way to know if it is operating
 at the correct output power.
</ul>
<p>
If these tests come back confirming reasonable behavior, it's probably a
laser diode or alignment problem.

<h3><A NAME="strjuugh">HYBRID B 2.3 Controller for uGreen Laser</A></h3>

This is the older type uGreen controller.  A typical unit is labeled as:
<p>
<ul>
<PRE>
Manufactured by Uniphase Limited
Witney, Oxon, OX8 7GE, U.K.
MODEL No. HYBRID B 2.3
SERIAL No. XXXX (Manual)
DATE: XXXX
</PRE>
</ul>
<p>
Power input is 5 VDC, 10 A max.  The only other thing needed to have the
laser power up is a jumper between pins 2 and 6 of CON2, the DB15 interface
connector.
<p>
IMPORTANT: While laser heads like the model 4600 include an EEPROM containing
information on head specific parameters (e.g., LD and cavity temperature),
the Hybrid B controller doesn't read the EEPROM (the cable connections for
the EEPROM signals aren't even present).  Thus, the controller and laser head
are a matched set.  Internal adjustments to the controller must be performed
to achieve anywhere near optimal performance (and possibly to prevent
possible damage to the pump diode as well) when a laser head other than
the original is installed.
<p>
(From: Kevin Criqui (usenet@kce.com).)

<h3><A NAME="ssljuugu">Using the HYBRID B Controller for Testing of uGreen
 Lasers</A></h3>

If your uGreen laser head came with a controller already configured for it,
then no need to do anything but enjoy. :)  (The serial numbers probably
won't match though.)  However, when mating an arbitrary
uGreen 4601, 4611, or 4711 laser head to a HYB B controller, it will be
necessary to adjust the internal pots to optimize performance.  (There may
be other uGreen laser heads that are compatible.)  Although the laser
head may appear to work when plugged in without doing anything else,
it may be running weak at the diode current limit which is bad all around.
<p>
In addition, the diode current limit may be set too high if the original laser
head was a -050 and yours is a -010.  Note that I do not know if they
actually have a different current limit but most of the controllers I've
tested had their current limit set to 1.5 A regarless of the power rating
of the laser, even for a -005.  Only one, a -020, was set at 1.4 A.
But it's possible some of the -010s (at
least) may use lower power diodes with a maximum current of 1 A or less
(though I've been assuming that 1 A is a safe value and have not seen
any damage or degradation in diode performance as a result).  The
higher power units appear to have diodes with a higher threshold
which would indicate they can handle a higher maximum current as well.
<p>
The HYB B is actually a complete laser diode controller minus a
user interface and can be very effectively used to test out uGreen
or other small DPSS lasers.  All the required controls and monitor test
points exist, though not in a particularly easy to use form.  The
documentation as best is known at present can be found in
<A HREF="juhyb23.pdf">Uniphase/IE Optomech HYBRID B Laser Power Controller
Specifications</A>.  I know that the calibration for diode current and
LD and RES temperatures are correct.  I'm suspect of the 1 V/W for the
power though.
<p>
Here is a summary of the most important items:

</PRE>
<p>
VR1 and VR5 behave exactly as expected.  VR3 is the initial diode current
set-point and is active as long as the laser is on and solely
determines the output power during warmup - there is no light feedback.
VR4 is used in conjunction with VR3 for the final laser output set-point
but has no effect until after the 3 minutes or so initial stabilizing
warmup period.  Then, both VR3 and VR4 affect output power.  However, there
is some sort of interaction between VR3 and VR4 such that setting them
up for a particular laser head will not have the same result for a different
one.  I still don't really know what VR2 does.  Note the calibration on
the currents - 0.5 V/A so don't get carried away by mistake!
<p>
In some ways, the HYB B is better than the fancy ILX Lightwave LDC-3900 since
the diagnostic connectors have everything available for monitoring.
It would be very straightforward to build a comprehensive control panel.
Most parameter monitor values can be read out as a voltage with the
decimal point appropriately positioned, or via at most a simple voltage
divider.
<p>
The DB15 external interface connector allows for nearly instantaneous
adjustment of output power once the light feedback loop is active.
During the warmup, it also affects the diode current.  I added a trimpot
for this purpose to one unit I tested.  The adjustment range was from
0 to 0.5 V corresponding to 0 to full power.  The circuitry was a 10K ohm
pot between 0V (Ground, pins 2,4) and a 100K ohm resistor to 5.12 V Ref
(pin 3).  The wiper went to Set-Point Input (pin 5).  See the
<A HREF="juhyb23.pdf">Uniphase/IE Optomech HYBRID B
Laser Power Controller Specifications</A> for additional wiring info.
<p>
What I would suggest if using a HYB B for testing multiple lasers is to
replace the cheap multiturn trimpots with high quality panel mounted multiturn
lockable pots of the same resistance value.  The original pots aren't all that
robust and exhibit a lot of backlash.
<p>
One thing I did find out: The controller doesn't have is sensing of an open
thermistor - it just keeps trying to heat the TEC in a futile effort to
achieve the set-point temperature!  Almost burned my finger on the LD
module and then discovered that one of the thermistor wires had broken
off.  Nothing seemed the worse for wear though after resoldering it. :)
<p>
Here is a rough procedure for testing a uGreen 4600 or 4700:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Mount the laser head on a good heatsink, with a fan if possible.
 The TECs may not be able to cool adequately if the case temperature
 is too high.  For some units, this appears to be not very warm.
<p>
<li>Set VR1 for 20 &degC, VR5 for a current limit of 1 A, and VRx for
 20 &degC.
<p>
<li>Power up the controller.  After 10 seconds or so, the laser should be
 running in constant current mode and if VR3 is set to a reasonable current,
 there should be green light.  A good setting for VR3 is probably where the
 laser output is at least 1/2 of the desired power.  Then, the temperature
 settings will be fairly close to those that are optimal at full power.
 If full power can be achieved at well under the current limit, use that.
 However, note that there will be power fluctuations as the temperatures
 stabilize.
<p>
<li>After about 3 minutes, the controller will switch to light feedback and
 VR4 will affect the output power, if operating below the current limit.
 Turn VR4 counterclockwise until the measured diode current is well below
 the current limit regardless of out bright the beam is.  However, if
 the desired output power can be achieved, use that as the initial setting.
<p>
<li>Set up to monitor diode current.  Lower diode current means better
 efficiency.  It would be a good idea to also monitor the relevant
 temperature so as not to go too far in either direction.  The next two
 steps will be setting the LD and RES temperatures to maximize performance.
<p>
<li>Adjust VR1 in small increments (about 1/4 turn) in an effort to
 minimize diode current by adjusting the wavelength to near 808 nm.
 Wait 30 seconds or so between changes to see
 if there has been an improvement (lower diode current).  If so, keep
 turning in the same direction.  Else, reverse.  Then fine tune in
 smaller increments to find the best spot.  Record the LD temperature.
 One turn of the pot is about 5 &deg;C.
<p>
<li>Adjust VRx in small increments (about 1/4 turn) in the same manner.
 However, the response of the RES is a broad function with small  ripples.
 The desired setting is the peak of the center ripple.  This is very
 sensitive with respect to temperature - the ripples have a period of
 about 0.6 to 0.8 &degC.  As the optimal point is reached, there may be
 rather wide swings in diode current.  Record the RES temperature that
 results in lowest diode current.  One turn of the pot is about 2.4 &deg;C.
 So, one period will be about 1/4 to 1/3 of a turn.
<p>
<li>Finally, adjust VR3 for the desired output power if it wasn't set there
 originally.
</ol>
<p>
If the laser head is a -050 or -020 and the full output power cannot be
achieved at leas than 1 A of diode current, up to 1.5 A may be safe.  One
way to be a little more sure is to determine the diode lasing threshold.
Low power diodes will have a lower threshold.  I've seen two general types
with thresholds of about 250 mA and 350 mA, respectively.  My *guess* is
that the 250 mA variety are good for 1 A while the 350 mA variety will be
good for at least 1.5 A.  But, your mileage may vary.

<h4><A NAME="strju4346h">Comparison of uGreen 4301 and 4600 Laser
 Heads</A></h4>

CAUTION: Although the model 4301 and some 46XX/47XX uGreen laser heads look
similar and use an HD15 male connector, the wiring is NOT the same and
damage to the laser head and/or controller will likely result if the
controller and laser head are not compatible.  Since the Hybrid B controller
does NOT read the head EEPROM to determine the correct diode and cavity
temperatures and other parameters, even swapping compatible laser heads will
likely result in less than optimal performance, and possible damage to the
laser diode if the maximum diode current is set too high in the controller.
<p>

<p>
The trouble with the 4601 and similar two-TEC uGreens (not those like
the 4301) is that while the optical design is good, the mechanical
design could stand improvement.  The alignment between the diode
collimating lens of the beam correcting optics, and crystal assembly is not
secured in a totally stable manner and can change with time.  Alignment
to restore normal operation is straightforward, but when the laser goes
out of alignment, the controller will attempt to restore power by
increasing diode current to the current limit.  This is generally set
at 1.5 amps, which is quite high for these diodes and may shorten
their life.  It can also damage the input face of the vanadate crystal
from the high pump power.  (For the HyB B controller, I usually reduce
the current limit to about 10 percent above the measured operating
current.  But the digital controllers don't permit this since
it looks like they read the current limit from the head EEPROM.)

The following sections apply to the 4601, 4611, 4711,

inside and out to <A HREF="ug4601-1.jpg">JDS Uniphase Model 4601 uGreen

<p>
Throughout the following sections, the term "Model 4600" may be used
to refer to any of these unless otherwise noted.

<h4><A NAME="strju4600c">Components of the Model 4600 uGreen Laser</A></h4>

Here is a breakdown of the major parts of the model 4601, 4611, 4711,
4712, and other similar SLM uGreen lasers.
Please refer to <A HREF="ug4601-1.jpg">JDS Uniphase Model 4601 uGreen
SLM Laser Head</A> for parts identification:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><b>One-piece aluminum frame and cover:</b> This is milled from a solid
 block of aluminum, usually with a black painted or anodized finish.
<p>
<li><b>Flexible PCB (including 24C32A EEPROM and pump diode protection
  opto-isolated MOS relay):</b> The EEPROM is not used by the Hybrid B
  controller and in fact, the SCL and SDA signals are not even passed
  through the interconnect cable for the HYB B but may be used
  by newer controllers.  The protection provided by the normally
  closed MOS relay is probably not very good as its maximum current is only
  about 100 mA but it is better than nothing.  (However, it should be
  disabled whenever the laser diode is powered.)
<p> 
  The 4712 has an additional circuit associated with the light feedback
  photodiode.  The 4617 has additional circuitry on the flex PCB.  (However,
  the 4617 is not built along the lines of the others.)  Details on these
  are not known.
<p>
<li><b>Pump module:</b>
<p>
 Please see: <A HREF="ug4600-p.jpg">Uniphase 4600 uGreen Laser Pump Module</A>.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Pump diode:</b> This is a bare diode chip (probably between 1 and
  1.5 W) on a C-block mount.  A cylindrical microlens is glued just in front of
  the emitting facet to reduce the fast-axis divergence.   The resulting
  divergence is typically 10 degrees in the slow-axis and 4 degrees or less in
  the fast-axis.  The diode is oriented at 45 degrees so that the green beam
  (which results in a 45 degree rotation from the axis of the pump and
  1,064 nm intracavity beam) will be vertically polarized.
<p>
 The C-mount diodes (non-lensed) may be the JDSU part number SDL-2360.

     1.2 W         400-600 mA      1.6-1.8  A
</PRE>
<p>
 However, based on my measurements, I'm not entirely convinced that the
 uGreen pump diodes are indeed exactly these.
<p>
 I determined the threshold, power output at various currents, and slope
 efficiency for the diodes in several 4601 and 4711 uGreen laser heads that had
 incomplete and useless resonators.  With the resonator/photodiode module
 removed, the diode module could be powered in the normal way on my LDC-3900
 with a Coherent LaserCheck used to measure power.  (This can also be done
 on an intact laser head.  Just remove the pump focusing lens assembly (two
 screws, may will need to chip away some tiny dabs of adhesive) and use a
 small mirror to redirect the pump beam.  Whether it's front or resr surface,
 dielectric or metal coated doesn't matter (a piece of a shaving mirror is
 fine!) as long as its reflectivity at around 808 nm is known or can be
 estimated or measured.  Just keep in mind that the diode output power
 readings in this case may be slightly lower due to the less than 100 percent
 reflectivity of the mirror.  Replace the pump focusing lens after the
 tests are complete.  Realignment probably won't be needed.
<p>
 WARNING: The output of the pump module may be greater than 1 WATT and is
 a nearly invisible collimated IR beam.  The use of proper laser safety
 goggles is essential, especially if using the mirror to redirect the
 beam since if it should shift in position, a beam could go shooting into
 your eyes.
<p>
 The slope efficiency was determined by dividing the difference in output
 power at 0.50 and 0.75 A by 0.250.  The threshold values were determined by
 finding the current at which there was some modest output power (25 to
 50 mW), and then working back to 0 mW based on the diode slope efficiency.
 This is more accurate than attempting to find the location where lasing
 begins as there's enough LED emission (a few mW) to make this point difficult
 to find.

<p>
 Note that with the pump optics in place, there are some losses due to the
 uncoated microlens but this is probably balanced by the efficient coupling
 compared to the wide divergence raw beam.  
<p>
 These all appear to be very healthy diodes so I doubt the thresholds
 or slope efficiencies got messed up as a result of use or damage.  (There
 were also several heads with obviously bad diodes ranging from nearly dead
 with an output at 1 A of less than 10 mW, to one which was outputting at about
 half power and slope efficiency probably meaning part of the stripe was
 non-lasing.)
<p>
 It may be possible to determine the stripe width based on the size of the
 output spot at a fixed distance, assuming the same optics are used for
 all diodes.  Diodes 1 and 5 had the same beam width at 30 cm so I assume
 they have the same stripe width.  I didn't check the others.
<p>
 My conclusions are that at least some of these may in fact *not* be the
 JDSU/SDL diode part numbers listed above!

 <li><b>Pump diode TEC glued or soldered to pump block, indium foil to

 <li><b>Pump diode thermistor:</b> Sensor for pump temperature control.
  The wires can just be seen sticking out of the blue glob in the photo.
<p>
 <li><b>Pump beam collimating lens:</b> Takes divergent beam from pump diode
  and makes it relatively parallel.  Adjustable position by loosening
  setscrews; adjustable distance by turning lens (after breaking free of
  bits of glue and loosening setscrew).  A piece of 0.05" aluminum scrap,
  filed to be slightly curved to fit over the lens in the slots works well
  to rotate it.  A layer of tape should be put over the tool to protect the
  lens from scratches.

<li><b>Resonator module:</b>
<p>
 Please see: <A HREF="ug4600-r.jpg">Uniphase 4600 uGreen Laser Resonator

<p>
 Note: Not all versions of these lasers have a removable cavity block
 as shown in the photo.  Those that do will have two small holes through the
 top of the resonator - the outer one is for access to the set-screw that
 locks the KTP in place while the central one is for the set-screw that
 locks the cavity block in place.  Those without a removable cavity block will
 only have one access hole.  The two types of resonator modules are
 interchangeable.

<p>
 <li><b>Green filter:</b> Blocks most of the backward going green light
  from getting to pump diode.
<p>
 <li><b>Cavity block:</b> Mount for vanadate, KTP, and OC mirror.  This is
  a separate removable assembly on some versions; an integral part of the
  resonator module on others.  See above.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Vanadate/HR mirror:</b> Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> laser crystal glued to
   mount which is glued into cavity block.  The HR mirror is coated on
   the rear (input face) of the vanadate.  The vanadate is ground with a
   significant wedge.  Aside from reducing the effects of reflection from
   its intracavity surface, the entire purpose of this is unknown.
<p>
  <li><b>KTP on cylindrical mount:</b> 3x3x3 mm KTP doubling crystal may be
   adjusted for best phase matching by rotating about the horizontal axis.  It
   may also be pulled out slightly if there is damage or dirt present in
   the beam path.
<p>
  <li><b>Intracavity aperture:</b> A perforated strip of thin metal almost
   at the OC mirror inserted from the top and glued in place.  This may not
   be present on all units (not in photo).
<p>
  <li><b>OC mirror:</b> HR@1064nm,HT@532nm, slightly concave.  Glued in place.
   Note how off-center it is on the unit in the photo!  I guess it's more

<h4><A NAME="strju4600p">Powering the Model 4600 uGreen Laser with a Laser
 Diode Driver</A></h4>

For simple testing at low power, the laser diode can be powered without TE
cooling of either the diode or cavity (though this will likely result in
suboptimal performance).  A constant current laser diode driver can be used
for this purpose.  For more extensive testing, a two channel TEC controller
capable of using an NTC thermistor for temperature sensors would be desirable.
<p>
CAUTION: Laser diodes are exceptionally sensitive to almost everything and
can easily be damaged or destroyed if improper techniques are used.  Refer
to the information in the chapter: <A HREF="laserdio.htm">Diode Lasers</A>
if in doubt about what this means!
<p>
Two sets of connections are needed power the pump diode in the 4600:
<p>
<ol>
<li>5 VDC between pins 1 (+) and 6 (-) to disable the MOS shorting relay.
<li>Constant current laser diode driver between pins 13 (+) and 15 (-).
</ol>
<p>
CAUTION: The 5 VDC must be present before the drive current is turned on.
Otherwise, there will be current flow through the MOS relay chip (typically
between 50 and 100 mW) which isn't designed for high current and may be
damaged (though I've done this accidentally more than once without anything
bad happening).
<p>
With no TE cooling, the diode should only be powered at the lowest current
that will be adequate for whatever tests are being performed.  For the model
4600, the typical threshold current (for green lasing) is between 300 and
500 mA.  I do not know what the maximum current is but 1 A appears to be
safe for a short period of time without cooling.  However, the diodes in
the lower power units at least might only be rated for 800 to 850 mA max.
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strju4600c">Components of the Model 4600 uGreen
Laser</A>.

<h4><A NAME="strju4600t">Typical Problems With uGreen Lasers</A></h4>

I've tested a variety of these lasers, mostly model 4601s and the essentially
similar 4611.  There are several principle types of problems that result in
low or no output:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alignment of Pump and/or KTP:</b> Since the pump and resonator are
 joined by screws, not thick gobs of adhesive, it would seem that alignment
 can change just enough over time to result in a distorted and weakened
 output beam, though exactly 0.00 mW of output power due to this cause is
 unlikely.
<p>
<li><b>Weak pump diode:</b> A few units have had a pump diode which was
 incapable of generating enough power to reach lasing threshold.  Several
 other units have weak output which might be due to this same cause - as yet
 to be determined.  However, in general, a weak pump diode doesn't appear to
 be anywhere near the top of the list of likely problems.
<p>
<li><b>Dirty intracavity optics surfaces:</b> I don't know how it happens in
 a sealed cavity, but more than one unit benefited from cleaning of the
 surfaces of the vanadate, KTP, and OC mirror that could be accessed.
 On the 4601 and 4611, only the KTP can be removed for cleaning.  The
 vanadate and OC mirror really are untouchable.  The only hope for cleaning
 them would be to remove the resonator (one screw), and blow out with low
 pressure compressed air or flush with clean solvent and hope. :)
<p>
<li><b>Damage to vanadate or KTP:</b> One unit had a KTP crystal cracked along
 one edge which probably didn't affect operation.  Another had a KTP crystal
 with a spot in the beam position - pulling the KTP assembly out about 1 mm and
 realigning avoided having to replace it.  And the KTP crystal in yet another
 laser had obvious damage, but that unit had other more serious problems.
<p>
<li><b>Thermal contact lost between pump module (usually) and base:</b> The
 symptom is that the TEC is unable to lower the pump temperature with any
 significant current flowing.  Loosen all mounting screws, raise side bars
 1/2 mm or so, tighten side screws, then tighten top screws - snug but not
 so hard as to risk cracking the TECs.  Some realignment may then needed.
 I also found one unit with a TEC that was incapable of providing adequate
 cooling even with good thermal contact.
</ul>
<p>
In general, it would appear that a unit that can be tweaked up to rated
specifications will output at least 1/4 of rated power at 1 A without
temperature control (at least for a short while).  If the power is way
low, e.g., 3 mW for a 50 mW rated laser, there is almost certainly
an actual problem which will need to be remedied to get anywhere near
rated output.  However, the output power of most units doesn't improve that
dramatically between ambient and optimal temperature settings.

<h4><A NAME="strju4600m">Examples of Minor Repairs to uGreen Lasers</A></h4>

I was given a pile of uGreen lasers to evaluate and repair if possible along
with several others that were incomplete but might be useful for parts.
They are mostly 4601s, 4611s, a substantially similar 4711, and a single 4712.
The only major difference with the 4712 is that there is an active photodiode
preamp, circuit and use as yet undetermined.  So, for that unit only, I had to
use an external laser power meter.  For all the others, the photodiode
output to a VOM on the uA or mA range could be used for peaking.  Only
after that was done, did I have to use the Coherent LaserCheck to determine
actual output power.
<p>
All testing was done on the LDC-3900.  It was assumed that 1 A would be
safe for the diode at least for a short duration.  So far, I have seen
no evidence to suggest that this is not the case.  However, using 750 mA
as a maximum current would be recommended.
<p>
The first chart is of the patients after initial treatment (if required)
which included alignment of the pump and KTP, but prior to determining
optimal temperature settings:

Units #1 and #2 are the same ones that were originally tested as
described in the section: <A HREF="laserscl.htm#scljuugx">Powering the
uGreen 4601 With the ILX Lightwave Model LDC-3900</A>.
<p>
The term "weak" is just subjective as I didn't actually measure the output
power during this initial treatment unless it appeared to be a substantial
fraction of rated power at 1 A.
<p>
For #5 (and a couple of other incomplete uGreens I have), there is no easy
repair since a multiaxis micropositioner and custom gripper are needed.
Eventually, I may borrow the needed micropositioner and build a gripper
but for now, it's a parts unit.

</PRE>
<p>
All 4601, 4611, and 4712 units had further fine tuning of alignment.  Where
units were very weak like #15, optimal settings couldn't be determined and
it wouldn't be worth it anyhow as any major repairs would likely affect them.
<p>
Unit #17 was not from the original batch of lasers but was the only -005
(probably no different than a -010 or maybe even higher power similar model
laser heads).
<p>
Unit #19 was also not from original batch of lasers.  It was originally doing
only 2 mW at 1 A.  Pulled KTP out about 1 mm and realigned pump focusing
optic.  Probably bad spot on vanadate or KTP.  So, pump locatione and KTP
orientation may each not be optimal, but together produce a reasonable
result.
<p>
Units #3 had a problem running SLM.  It appeared to only be a problem on
the uGreen digital controller (model 4802).  I discovered this a couple
years after doing these initial tests, just as I was about to ship the
system to a buyer.  So, I sent #19 instead.  While it <i>seemed</i> to have a
beautiful TEM00 beam at all power levels on the LDC-3900 lab controller, on
the uGreen controller, the beam was TEM10 until very high power (well above
50 mW).  And using an SFPI, a second solid longitudinal mode could be seen
up to above 50 mW, and a third weaker one at some power levels.  At first I
thought that maybe the cavity/RES temperature wasn't correct.  Although
I had added a pot to fake the LD temperature (since the EEPROM value
is way off for some reason), I didn't do that for the RES temperature.
But that didn't smell right, a varying the temperature on the lab controller
had no obvious effect.  I now believe it probably was messed
up on the lab controller as well but I just didn't notice it.  Even
after carefully readjusting both the pump beam and KTP alignment again, the
multiple modes were still there.  But adjusting the pump beam focusing
seems to have mostly cured it, and reduced the pump current at all levels of
output power significantly.  Now, there is a second mode popping up only
sometimes at low power on the digital controller.  Above 50 percent power,
it never appears.  And, once it goes away, it usually stays away at all
power levels.
<p>
Units #6 and #8 still don't meet specs but produce enough output to be useful
for experiments and testing of controllers that might not treat them too
kindly.
<p>
Unit #16 - the only 4301 - originally had no output due to a very weak pump
diode.  Details of its surgery may be found in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strju4301r">Replacing the Pump Diode in uGreen 4301 and
4501 Laser Heads</A>.  With a new diode, the 4301 now has the lowest operating
current at rated power of the bunch. 
<p>
Unit #18, the only 4501 - essentially identical to the 4301 - was also not
from the original batch of lasers.  But like the 4301, it had a bad diode.
It's diode was also replaced with something I had kicking around and now
performs reasonably well. :)
<p>
Units #14 and #6 were the only others that had actual major parts replaced with
50 percent success so far (#14 meets specs, #6 does not unless it's relabeled
to a 4611-005, or a 4611-007 if run at 1 A!).  The resonator in some of these
lasers is held in place with just a setscrew and easily swapped once the
photodiode and its optics have been removed.
Another transplant was attempted - replacing the KTP and then moving the
entire resonator from #15 to #6 whose pump was tested and found to be good.
But there was no improvement suggesting that there is likely dirt or damage
on the inaccessible internal optics surfaces (a spot was found on the
vanadate).  Installing the resonator from #12 into #6 resulted in some
improvment but I still don't know what the real problem is.  #8 may have
a weak pump - I have not tested it as yet though I also suspect a
resonator problem.
<p>
I did completely disassemble (breaking the glue bonds for the vanadate
mount and OC mirror) and clean the resonator from #2.  All surfaces
look perfect.  However, after reassembly matching up the glue for the
vanadate mount and realigning the OC mirror, there was little or no
improvement.  So, it's possible there is coating damage on the vanadate
not visible by eye.  I don't know what else could be wrong.  
<p>
The temperatures are really only as accurate as the thermistors and the
accuracy of the measuring equipment.  On another LDC-3900 with the default
C1/C2/C3 settings, they would probably be close.  But, actually
powering any given laser will require fine adjustments on whatever controller
is used.  For the RES temperature, 0.02 &deg;C resolution is really needed to
fully optimize performance. However, the 0.1 &deg;C resolution of the LDC-3900
without playing with the C1/C2/C3 constants is close enough for testing.  It's
also quite possible I haven't found the "sweet spot" for all of them - the RES
response is doubly periodic - a broad cycle of something like 30 &deg;C and
many little peaks 0.6 &deg;C to 0.8 &deg;C apart.
<p>
The broad response a result of the KTP being used as a birefringent filter.
This is periodic but with a cycle of about 30 &deg;C for the 3 mm long
KTP.  Thus, if the KTP is replaced, the optimal temperature setting for the
resonator will likely be totally different.
<p>
Optimal temperatures also depend to some extent on the laser diode current
(mostly LD temperature) and output power (RES temperature).  If the lid is
in place, depending on ambient temperature, that will change the settings
by a few tenths of a &deg;C or more.
<p>
In general, a salvageable unit will be at least 1/4 of rated output power
at 1 A with no temperature control (at least for a little while).  LD
temperature does a small amount of peaking.  Most comes from RES temperature
with power variations of up to 50 percent or more near the best setting.
<p>
So, out of 12 uGreen lasers that may have spent some time in a dumpster,
8 could be restored to original specifications at least by my criteria which
is to achieve rated power at less than 1 A of pump current with good beam
quality.  A ninth does at least a stable 2 mW. :)
<p>
I still do not know if there is any physical difference among lasers with
the same model number but differing power ratings.  For example, is a
4601-005 the same as a 4601-050, just selected based on actual performance?
Or, for example, does the lower power laser actually use a different pump
diode?

<h4><A NAME="strju4600o">Model 4600 uGreen Pump, KTP, and Output
 Cleaning</A></h4>

Cleaning of the external optics can be done with lens tissue and alcohol.
The only optic that is likely to require cleaning under normal operating
conditions would be the final output lens which probably has one of your big
fat fingerprints on it. :)
<p>
Most critical optics in terms of cleanliness are the 4 optic surfaces inside
the cavity.  Unfortunately, of these, only the KTP is readily accessible.
The intracavity surfaces of the vanadate and OC mirror are not easily cleaned.
Other than blowing out dust with a squeeze bulb or compressed air through the
hole in which the KTP assembly mounts, there is no easy solution.  It might be
possible to flood the inside of the cavity with ultrapure acetone or alcohol
but I haven't tried this.  I also haven't figured out how the interior of a
sealed chamber can get dirty - but it indeed does since cleaning the KTP on
several of these lasers had a dramatic effect on output power and beam
quality.
<p>
For details on removing the KTP for cleaning, see the information in the
next section on KTP alignment.

<h4><A NAME="strju4600a">Model 4600 uGreen Pump, KTP, and Output
 Alignment</A></h4>

Minor problems with alignment are likely to manefest themselves as a
weak and/or distorted output beam.
<p>
One supposedly working unit I tested did not operate in TEM00 (single
spatial) mode but was more TEM01 with two spots on a 45 degree diagonal.
This is a defect since having a single longitudinal mode
implies that the laser is operating with a single spatial mode as well.
The anomaly wasn't visible with the original external beam expanding
optics in place, only with the raw output of the laser head itself.
Projected on a screen about a meter away, it was quite obvious and gets
slightly worse after the jump to full power.  The most likely cause of
multi-spatial mode operation of a TEM00 laser is misalignment of the laser
cavity or pump beam.  However, with this particular unit, there might
have been other problems.  Unfortunately, I no longer have it in my
possession to check.
<p>
The pump and resonator modules themselves are unlikely to ever need alignment
since they are very tightly screwed and/or glued together.  As a practical
matter, the only things that may need alignment unless the laser was really
terribly abused are the pump beam position, KTP angle, and output optics.
Even these are very unlikely to change on their own.  However, sometimes
due to contamination or who-knows-what, a bad spot will develop on the
vanadate, KTP, or OC (inner surface), and realignment of the KTP and
pump beam may move the active spot enough to avoid the damaged area.
Any significant change in pump beam position will likely also impact KTP
alignment, and vice-versa.  However, finding the "sweet spots" can be
tricky because the optimal cavity temperature also depends on KTP
orientation.  So, some iteration may be required and this could take
some time (and require the sacrifice of a few of your hairs).
<p>
The following applies specifically to the models 4601, 4611, 4711, 4712,
and other similar uGreen lasers.  Please refer to
<A HREF="ug4601-1.jpg">JDS Uniphase Model 4601 uGreen SLM Laser Head</A>
for parts identification.
<p>
<b>Pump beam alignment:</b>
<p>
CAUTION: If your laser produces a nice round spot even at low power, there
is probably no need to touch anything.  It's very easy to make things worse!
<p>
The following assumes that the only problem is pump beam alignment and that
the cavity and pump diode are known to be good.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the output collimating lens (optional).  This will result in the
 beam diverging more rapidly making it easier to see the exact shape.
<p.
<li>Power up the laser head in constant current mode so that it produces
 a weak beam (less than 1 mW) projected onto a white card.  The diode can be
 powered for a reasonable length of time without cooling as long as it is
 at low current.  The lasing threshold for the 4600 seems to be around 300
 to 400 mA for a reasonably healthy unit that is fairly well aligned.  A
 current of 600 mA is probably sufficient to produce a usable spot even with
 a moderately misaligned laser.  Under no circumstances should the diode
 current be set above 1 A.  The current limit for the diodes in these
 lasers varies from about 1.1 A to 1.5 A, but there is really no way to
 know for sure without checking how the controller (if available) is set up.
<p>
 Note: If the output optics are grossly misaligned, part or all of the beam
 may be cut off.  If this is the case, do the output optics alignment first
 or remove them entirely.
<p>
<li>If the beam shape is TEM00 - a single nice and round spot with negligible
 off-axis scatter except for the pair of ghost spots on the diagonal which
 are unavoidable, there is probably no need to go further.  Make sure it
 remains TEM00 from threshold to 800 mA or so.
<p>
<li>Assuming the beam is not TEM00, slightly loosen the two cap screws
 holding the beam collimating lens in place.  This can be done with a
 ball-end hex wrench (barely or not at all on some units) or with a pair
 of needle nose pliers.  The lens assembly should be loosened just enough
 to be able to push around by hand but still remain in position.
 There is a threaded hole on the top of the white plastic piece that is
 intended for a setscrew to lock the collimating lens in place.  DO NOT
 touch the set screw!  But a 2-56 screw tightly threaded into this hole will
 act as a nice handle during alignment.
<p>
<li><b>Carefully</b> change the position of the pump beam collimating lens in
 super small increments.  One tenth of a millimeter is significant.  Watch the
 beam shape as you do this.  It will change from TEM00 to TEM0X or TEMX0
 or any combination during this process.  Try not to lose the beam entirely
 but if this happens, slightly increase the diode current to see if it is
 still capable of lasing.  If not, a search procedure will have to be used
 to reacquire it.  Under no circumstances, should the diode current be
 set above 1 A, and even 1 A should not be maintained for too long without
 active cooling.
<p>
 CAUTION: When pushing the lens assembly from side-to-side, pressing on
 the flex circuit where it is soldered to the temperature sensor thermistor
 is almost unavoidable.  However, this should be avoided as the wires are
 very fine and will break off with only minimal abuse.  If a wire breaks
 very short, replacement of the thermistor may be required.  This is one
 reasons why using the 2-56 screw is preferred.
<p>
<li>The alignment "sweet spot" will result in a noticeably brighter beam
 and TEM00 beam shape.  Gently pressing on the resonator module successively
 in all four directions should result in a slight <i>decrease</i> in beam
 brightness, indicating that the optimal position has been found.  Confirm
 that the beam remains TEM00 from threshold to 900 mA.  With good alignment,
 output power should more or less increase steadily as pump current is
 increased.  However, due to the temperature of both the pump diode and
 cavity/KTP changing, some ripple will be present in the output power
 function.  But imperfect alignment (both pump and KTP) may result in a sudden
 <i>decrease</i> of output power at some levels of pump current.
<p>
<li>Carefully tighten the screws holding the pump beam collimating lens
 assembly in place and then double check that nothing has shifted position.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Pump focusing lens adjustment:</b>
<p>
The pump focusing is not a super critical adjustment but getting the smallest
spot is necessary to assure single spatial mode and single longitudinal mode
operation.  I've never found this to be a problem with laser heads that
weren't opened, but if parts have been swapped or even just removed and
replaced, it's worth checking.
<p>
I had one laser head where everything seemed to be fine with decent power
and a good looking beam, but it was not SLM.  Adjusting the pump focus
cured that and also increased output power for a given current significantly.
<p>
<ul>
<p>That set-screw in the white Nylon pump beam collimating assembly housing
 mentioned above locks the focusing lens focus position.  Loosen it with a
 suitable hex wrench.  The screw can be removed entirely since the focusing
 lens barrel is generally quite tight in the housing and won't move
 on its own.  A side benefit of this is that there is much more depth
 to thread in a 2-56 screw to aid in adjusting its position (see above). 
<p>
<li>Power the laser at medium power while monitoring the output with a
 laser power meter.
<p>
<li>The pump focusing lens barrel has 4 slots cut into it to allow for
 a suitable tool to rotate it.  Using a suitable tool, adjust for
 maximum power on the meter.  Avoid getting in the way of the pump beam
 with your suitable tool as it may be damaged  Also avoid scratching
 the lens.  A small flat blade screwdriver that just fits in the slots
 is one suitable tool.
</ul>
<p>
<b>KTP alignment:</b>
<p>
Problems with KTP alignment are very unlikely unless actually messed up
by a human. :)  However, I have found that somehow, the KTP (and probably
the vanadate and OC mirror as well) may pick up an invisible (at least to
the human eye) layer dirt, dust, outgassed glue, who knows? :)  Removal of
the KTP assembly and gentle dusting with a piece of lens tissue or more
thorough cleaning with pure alcohol may help immensely.  Or, simply
pulling the KTP mount out a millimeter or so and readjusting its orientation
may get around the bad spot.  However, touch-up of the pump beam alignment
may also be needed.
<p>
The KTP crystal is mounted in a holder on the far side of the cavity block
(with the laser output-end facing to the right).  There is a 2-56 tapped
hole in the center of the shaft on which the KTP can be rotated.  A setscrew
from the top secures it once alignment is complete.  But see the CAUTION
below before attempting to do anything.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Using a fine scribe or similar tool, make a note of the original
 orientation of the KTP holder.  This isn't that critical since it's easy
 to find it again and the required orientation accuracy is beyond what
 would be obvious just looking at a scribe mark, but this will save some
 uncertainty on the two peaks which are at a 180 degree orientation and
 may have different lasing performance.
<p>
<li>Use a dental pick or Xacto knife to remove any dabs of adhesive around
 the edge of the KTP holder that  may be present..
<p>
<li>Make sure the setscrew is tight.  Then install a 2-56 cap screw, 1/8 inch
 MAXIMUM thread length, in the hole to act as a handle so the shaft can be
 turned once it is free.  (This "handle" screw can be left in place
 permanently.)  This is adequate if the KTP holder simply needs to be
 turned.  However, if it needs to be pulled out a bit, then use a
 2-56 x 1 inch cap screw with a 2-56 nut threaded 1/8" onto its end.
 A large washer or nut installed at the head-end of the screw can be used
 as a handle.  Thread the screw in 1/8" maximum and then tighten the nut
 to secure it.
<p>
 CAUTION: The 2-56 hole is tapped all the way through to the KTP and
 tightening a screw longer than about 1/8 inch (depending on the particular
 version of the 4600 laser) into it may shatter the KTP.  Don't ask how I
 found out. :(  What morons.  Although only about a 1x1 mm area in one corner
 was still intact on one face, I did manage to repair it somewhat by filing
 down and remounting what was left of the KTP so the undamaged area was
 centered in the holder.  The bottomless hole came in handy for
 threading in a nylon screw to hold the KTP during testing and until
 the glue cured.  I wonder if that is what is done during manufacturing -
 it would be convenient.  So maybe they aren't <i>total</i> morons. :)
 I don't know if the laser is operating at peak efficiency but the beam is
 clean and the threshold is low.  There is more on KTP repair in the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strskc">Salvaging the Damaged KTP Crystal in a
 DPSS Laser</A>.
<p>
<li>Loosen the setscrew recessed in the top of the laser.  If the shaft
 doesn't turn easily, there may be still be some adhesive residue that
 will need to be removed.
<p>
 To remove the KTP assembly for cleaning, either grab the head of the 2-56
 screw with a pair of needle nose pliers and gently pull it out, or thread
 a longer screw into the hole just a couple of turns and pull it out with
 that.  
<p>
<li>Operate the laser at medium power in constant current mode or with a
 constant current driver.
<p>
<li>Adjust the angle of the KTP for maximum power and note its value if
 a laser power meter is being used.  Then, rotate the KTP 180 degrees
 (which should also result in green lasing) and check the maximum power
 there.  Select the orientation that produces the greater output power.
 If they are about the same, use the original orientation if known.
 (Which of these is selected really shouldn't matter for phase matching
 but there is usually one preferred orientation, possibly due to the
 side-to-side (yaw) angle which isn't adjustable.)  The KTP adjustment
 isn't nearly as critical as for mirror alignment but still needs to be
 quite precise for optimal performance.
<p>
<li>Carefully tighten the setscrew and confirm that the output power hasn't
 decreased significantly.  If it has, some very small adjustments will be
 needed with the set screw semi-tight.
<p>
<li>Since the KTP and pump alignment, as well as the cavity/KTP temperature
 interact to some extent, it may be necessary to go back and forth among the
 adjustments to fine tune the laser.  If a temperature controller is available,
 setting the cavity for about 35 &deg;C would probably be a good start since
 this is what's typically used.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Output optics alignment:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Clamp the laser head down on an optical rail or provide some other means
 to determine the location of the beam axis.  Mark this exact location of
 where the beam should be on a white card and position it about 1 meter
 from the laser.
<p>
<li>Power up the laser so it produces a low power beam.  If the beam is
 centered on the target spot, there is no need for alignment.
<p>
<li>If the beam isn't centered, remove the output aperture plate (one screw).
 Take care not to break off tbe easily broken off tab (as was done with the
 unit in the photo!) as it becomes a pain to adjust. :)
<p>
<li>Check that the output collimator lens (the outside one) is centered
 in its mount.  If not, loosen its two screws and center it using a toothpick
 or other soft tool to move it.
<p>
<li>Partially loosen the two screws holding the output beam expander lens and
 adjust it so that the beam spot is centered on the target.  Tighten the
 screws.  If this isn't possible or the beam ends up being way off center
 in the output collimator lens, the output collimator lens may need to be
 adjusted slightly.
<p>
<li>Install the output aperture plate and adjust it so the beam goes cleanly
 though it centered between its diagonal sides.  Only the main beam should
 get through - the ghost spots (usually two) should be block.
</ol>
<p>
Note that the opposite order of adjusting the beam expander lens (center the
beam) and collimator lens (recenter the beam) may be more optically perfect
but I prefer to have the output lens centered and I doubt it matters all that
much. :)  However, with some units, alignment of the beam out of the laser
resonator is too far off to permit this, though it may be possible to loosen
the hold-down screws for both the pump and resonator/photodiode modules and
rotate the entire rig a bit but there is a small chance this will
affect pump alignment.

<h4><A NAME="strju4600x">Model 4600 uGreen Laser Disassembly</A></h4>

WARNING: The output of the pump module may be greater than 1 WATT and is
a nearly invisible collimated IR beam.  If powering the pump module without
the resonator module installed, proper laser safety goggles are essential
unless terminated in a suitable beam stop or enclosed in such a way that
excape is impossible.  It's too easy to become careless.  While the beam
probably won't set things on fire without focusing, it is capable of permanent
instant damage to vision at a considerable distance.  Since it appears dim
red, there is no awareness of location as with a visible laser.  This is no
5 mW laser pointer!
<p>
Many parts of the uGreen laser head are attached or locked in position using
some type of blue adhesive.  This is very hard but will yield to a sharp
blade.  It also softens - slowly - if soaked in acetone (nail polish
remover) for a few hours or days.
<p>
The following procedure will permit breaking down the model 4601, 4611, 4711,
4712, and other similar uGreen lasers to their component modules.  This should
be reversible, maybe.  Please refer to the photo in
<A HREF="ug4601-1.jpg">JDS Uniphase Model 4601 uGreen SLM Laser Head</A>
for parts identification:
<p>
<b>Laser disassembly:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the cover and cable.  (Yes, this will void the warranty!)
 Install a shorting plug on the connector to protect the pump diode
 if it is or may be good.
<p>
<li>Unsolder the photodiode and thermistors from the flexible PCB.  Caution:
 The thermistor leads are very thin and fragile!  However, if one or more
 breaks off, don't panic.  It's quite easy to use a hand drill with 1/16"
 bit to remove the carcass of the broken thermistor and then install a new one
 filling the hole and covering the body with Epoxy.  The part is a common NTC
 thermistor, 10K ohms at 25 &deg;C, about 1 mm in diameter.
<p>
<li>Remove the hex screws holding the laser modules in position (typically
 4 or 8 on the sides and 4 on top of the black plastic bars running along
 the base).
<p>
<li>Free the laser modules from the baseplate.  With some luck, much of
 the indium foil will remain intact.
<p>
<li>Carefully position the laser modules to gain access to the pins on
 the rear of the pump module so they can be desoldered freeing the laser
 modules from the flex PCB.  Install a shorting jumper between the pump diode
 pin and the metal block.
<p>
<li>Remove the two large cap screws holding the output beam expanding lens to
 the laser base.
<p>
<li>Remove the cap screw holding the output aperture plate to the laser base.
<p>
<li>Remove the two small hex screws holding the output collimating lens to the
 laser base.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Pump module disassembly:</b>
<p>
 Please see: <A HREF="ug4600-p.jpg">Uniphase 4600 uGreen Laser Pump Module</A>.
<p>
The major components of the pump module are the pump mount, pump diode,
pump block with TEC, and pump collimating lens assembly.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the two hex screws holding the pump collimating lens assembly
 in place.
<p>
<li>Remove the two hex screws holding the mount on which the
 diode is actually mounted to the pump diode module.  Take care not
 to damage the insulating material between these as the two parts
 are separated.
<p>
<li>If the pump diode is to be replaced, carefully scribe a line around
 the perimeter of the old diode to mark its position.
<p>
 If it weren't for the microlens, it is likely that replacement diodes would
 be readily available.  However, lensed diodes are usually not standard
 products and even if they are available, minimum order quantities will
 apply and they will be expensive.
<p>
<li>Unsolder the negative lead and remove the mounting screw for the
 diode.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Resonator module disassembly:</b>
<p>
The major components of the resonator module are the pump focusing lens,
cavity block, cavity holder with TEC, and power pickup assembly.
<ol>
<li>Remove the two hex screws holding the power pickoff assembly.
<p>
<li>Remove the two Philips flat head screws holding the pump beam focusing
 lens.  There may be spots of glue still present but these will come free
 quite easily.
<p>
<li>Loosen the setscrew in the middle of the top of the cavity holder almost
 until if comes off and slide out the cavity block noting the pair of O-rings
 for sealing.  Thread the setscrew back in until it is flush with the top
 of the cavity holder so it won't get lost.
<p>
<li>Loosen the setscrew locking the KTP assembly in place in the cavity block
 and pull out the KTP assembly using a 2-56 screw threaded NO MORE than 1/8
 inch into the tapped hole as a handle.  There may be some dabs of glue that
 will need to be removed to free this piece.
</ol>
<p>
Going beyond this level of disassembly is not recommended as the pump focusing
lens, vanadate, and OC mirror are aligned and secured with copious amounts of
glue and realignment would require multiaxis positioners.  However, swapping
of the pump or resonator modules between laser heads is straightforward.
(Swapping the inner cavity block probably should not be attempted as the
position/angle of the focusing lens is matched to its cavity block.)  Only
the minimal realignment outlined in the previous section is needed.  But note
that if a controller that reads information stored in the serial EEPROM on the
flex PCB is used, the settings will be incorrect for the pump and/or cavity
parameters.

<h4><A NAME="strju4600r">Replacing the OC Mirror on a uGreen Laser</A></h4>

The following applies to most uGreen laser heads except the 4301 which
uses a Multiple Crystal Assembly (MCA) and has no separate OC mirror.
<p>
The OC mirror is attached to the resonator behind the optical
pickoff/photodiode assembly.  Replacement or reattachment might
be required for several reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The mirror is damaged (e.g., chip or scratch in the beam path).
<li>The mirror fell off (this happened to me by accident as the adhesive
 wasn't very strong).
<li>The particular pump location on the vanadate is bad (apparently rather
 common as I've seen it on two uGreen laser heads).
</ul>
<p>
If the pump alignment hasn't been disturbed, this is relatively
straightforward but will require a solidly mounted laser head and
micropositioner with gripper for the mirror.  One complicating factor
is that the original OC mirror may not have been mounted flush to
the surface of the laser resonator but might have been supported solely
by glue - and at an angle.  While the OC is highly curved and normally
this would allow alignment to be performed with only movement on the
surface, it would appear that due to the funny wedge of the vanadate,
some of these don't have very good vanadate alignment and this method
doesn't work.  If it did, the laser could be mounted in a vice with
the output pointing up, the OC placed on the surface and moved around
until there was a strong beam, then fastened with a few dabs of 5 minute
Epoxy or UV cure adhesive.
<p>
For the case where the mirror just popped off and everything else is
reasonably well aligned, the KTP can be left in place and the procedure
performed by obtaining and maximizing green light.  Where the orientation
of the KTP is unknown, IR lasing must be achieved first with the KTP
removed since there is no way to set the angle of the KTP close enough
for there to be any reasonable chance of green photons.  In this case, an IR
detector card will be required.
<p>
Where it is desired to remove an OC mirror that is still firmly attached
to the resonator for use in another uGreen or other laser, soaking in
acetone (nail polish remover) should soften the blue adhesive enough to
allow the mirror to be lifted off with no damage to the coatings.  Up to
48 hours or more may be required if there is adhesive under the mirror
(on the coated area) but much less if it's only on the sides.  In the
later case, just some modest force may cause the mirror
to pop off without the use of any solvent to loosen it.  The glue attached to
the resonator will probably remain intact so that the mirror might be
replaced in nearly perfect alignment.  So, if this is desired, don't
immediately scrape the remaining glue from the resonator.
<p>
WARNING: With the IR blocking filter removed, there will be a fairly well
collimated beam at 1,064 nm when alignment is achieved.  This is leakage
through the output mirror.  It is totally invisible and may be powerful
enough (a few mW) to pose a risk to vision.  There will also be some leakage
of the 808 nm pump wavelength.  And, hopefully some bright 532 nm light!
The use of proper laser safety goggles is highly recommended.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Mount the laser head and micropositioner on a rigid platform like a
 thick aluminum plate or optical table.  Ideally, 5 degrees of freedom
 are required relative to the resonator - pan, tilt (roll on the
 micropositioner), X, Y, and Z.  However, with a bit of care,
 something that only does X, Y, and Z can be used but the mirror might
 have to be mounted at a slight angle on the micropositioner.
<p>
<li>Check for any contamination of the inner curved surface OC mirror
 and clean it if necessary using one of the acceptable methods for cleaning
 dielectric laser mirrors.  See the sections starting with
 <A HREF="laseratr.htm#atrcln">Cleaning of Laser Optics</A>.  If there are
 any damaged areas, don't panic.  All you need is a good spot  about 0.2 mm
 or so in diameter and there are an infinite number of orientations and
 positions for the mirror that will work equally well.
<p>
<li>Mount the mirror in some sort of gripper on the micropositioner.
 This should hold the mirror snugly but allow it to be released without
 applying too much force that might break the glue bond.  I made one
 out of a piece of thin aluminum (roof flashing!) folded over and fastened
 to the micropositioner using a screw with another between the two sides
 to clamp the mirror.
<p>
<li>With everything set, power up the laser either using the Hybrid B
 controller, a laser diode driver, or a constant current power supply.
 Set the current to about 0.75 A.  Powering the LD TEC is desirable but
 not essential for the few minutes this <i>should</i> require.
<p>
<li>Using an IR detector card for IR or a white card for green, move the mirror
 around in an effort to get a beam.  With the highly curved mirror and
 short cavity, this is actually quite easy and can even be done by hand
 without the micropositioner, but then there is no way to keep the mirror
 in place to add the glue!  Once there is a beam, reduce the diode current
 to a value just sufficient to be able to see the beam on the card.
<p>
<li>It's not that important to have the absolute best beam possible since it
 can always be fine tuned later using pump alignment.  But, if the original
 problem was a bad spot on the vanadate, now is the time to shift the
 pump alignment a bit which will also shift the OC mirror position.
<p>
<li>(Skip if KTP is already in place.) Once there is an IR beam, install
 the KTP and adjust it for the best green beam and lock in place.
<p>
<li>Fasten the OC mirror in place with 3 or 4 small dabs of 5 minute Epoxy
 or low shrink UV cure adhesive.  Take care not to drip it between the mirror
 and resonator!  Monitor the output while the glue sets.
<p>
<li>Once the original glue has set, fine tune the pump and KTP alignment
 to for best beam shape and maximum output power.
<p>
<li>Add some additional adhesive to assure a robust bond.  Once it sets,
 do a final alignment if necessary.
</ol>
<p>
Once I accepted the fact that rigidly mounting everything really was
essential and did so, it took about 10 minutes to perform the initial
alignment with glue.

<h3><A NAME="strju4301d">The Model 4301 SLM uGreen Laser</A></h3>

The uGreen 4301 uses an optically contacted MCA (Multiple Crystal Assembly)
instead of discrete components (vanadate/KTP/OC).  It appears to be an older
model subsequently replaced by the 46XX/47XX series.  It's possible this was
done for cost reasons though this would be hard to understand comparing the
relative simplicity of the 4301 to the complexity of uGreen lasers using
discrete crystals and optics.  But an optically contacted MCA would have been a
rather expensive part when first introduced.  A more likely reason is the
susceptibility of MCAs to damage and general reliability issues.  Stability
of the MCA's flat-flat cavity might also have been an issue.

<h4><A NAME="strju4301c">Components of the Model 4301 uGreen Laser</A></h4>

Here is a breakdown of the major parts of the model 4301 SLM uGreen laser.

 <li><b>Pump diode:</b> This is a bare diode chip (probably between 1 and
  1.5 W) on a C-block mount.  There is no fast-axis beam correction.  The
  diode is oriented at 45 degrees so that the green beam
  (which results in a 45 degree rotation from the axis of the pump and
  1,064 nm intracavity beam) will be vertically polarized.

<h4><A NAME="strju4301p">Repairing a 4301 uGreen Laser Head Damaged by Excessive Power</A></h4>

This was a 4301-10 on a HYB B controller being set up to drive it around
its rated power of 10 mW.  The current limit was set to 800 mA which is
safe for the pump diode and the initial current was set at 500 mA which
resulted in about 8 mW of output power with a nice clean beam.  Everything
was fine until the controller switched into constant light mode.  At that
instant, the diode current increased to 800 mA, output power dropped
to a mW or so, and the beam shape turned into a mess.  The high diode
current was likely a result of the monitor photodiode feedback gain being
set too low.
<p>
Although I was suspect of the controller damaging the pump diode, the messed
up beam suggested that there was nothing wrong with the diode as almost
any such damage would not change the beam shape appreciably.  Thus, crystal
damaged was likely.
<p>
The 4301 uses a Multiple Crystal Assembly (MCA, also known as a composite
crystal).  With it's very short gain section (probably 0.3 to 0.5 mm),
it may be more susceptible to thermal damage than the discrete crystals
and optics used in the 46XX/47XX uGreen lasers.  In addition, the MCA has
a much higher slope efficiency and 800 mA might result in an output power
of 75 or 100 mW which is possibly too much for for the MCA to handle.
At least that was the hypothesis. :)
<p>
First, I loosened the pump beam collimating lens assembly in an attempt to
reposition the pump spot figuring this would be easier than gaining access
to the screws holding the MCA mounting plate in place.  However, while
there was some evidence of improvement by move the collimator, it wasn't
enough to restore either normal output power or beam shape.
<p>
So, it was necessary to remove both modules (4 screws).  I then removed and
inspected the MCA expecting to find some obvious damaged spots.  But there
were none, at least to the unaided eye.  While the MCA was removed, the
pump was powered and the collimating optics reset to produce the
strongest and most symmetric pump beam as this was totally messed up from
the previous adjustments.  The MAC was then replaced with the screws
tightened just just enough to hold it in place and still allow for the
plate to be moved around by hand.
<p>
With the laser now powered up at the original 250 mA diode current, there
was an immediate improvement.  In fact, it wasn't possible to find the
original bad spot or at least it wasn't easy (and I didn't try all that
hard).  With everything reinstalled, operation was similar to that prior
to the "event".
<p>
To minimize the chance of a repeat of this problem, the diode current limit
on the HYB B was set to 600 mA.  The laser runs at 11.2 mW at about 540 mA
after tweaking the LD and RES temperatures so that should be enough headroom.
<p>
I know that this laser would run at greater than 20 mW without incident
and assume that there is no real difference between the 10 mW and 20 mW
versions of the 4301.  I don't know if there is one rated at 50 mW.

<h4><A NAME="strju4301r">Replacing the Pump Diode in uGreen 4301 or 4501
 Laser Heads</A></h4>

The following applies to both the 4301 and the essentially identical 4501
uGreen laser head, and probably to other similar models.  Any differences
are noted.
<p>
The 4301 and 4501 are the simplest of the dual TEC uGreen laser heads.  They
use a Multi-Chip Assembly (MCA) rather than discrete cavity and the pump beam
alignment is much less critical.  The pump diode is a standard C-block,
non-lensed type and is easily replaceable.  It appears to be the same diode
as used in the 4702 uGreen laser head.  Some 5 minute Epoxy and possibly
a replacement piece of indium foil will be required in addition to a
0.5 to 1.2 watt C-block 808 nm diode with a stripe width of 50 to 100 um.
Some pure acetone is desirable to clean the diode prior to final assembly.
But this can be avoided if it is known the diode is new and/or clean, and
care is taken to avoid contamination of the diode's output facet during
installation.
<p>
I repaired a uGreen 4301-20 and a uGreen 4501-50 with dead pump diodes -
confirmed by testing the diodes on a lab controller.  For the 4301,
the MCA was also tested by using the pump module from a 4601 to generate
green light from the 4301 laser module.  The MCA in the 4501 was inspected
visually.  The replacements were diodes from a batch that may have been the
original part though I have no way to know for sure.  However, it appears
to be a normal C-block 808 nm diode with the beam exiting away from the
mount.
<p>
Refer to the photo in
<A HREF="ug4301-1.jpg">JDS Uniphase Model 4301 uGreen SLM Laser Head</A> for
parts identification.
<p>
Everything should be done using proper ESD precautions.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Detach the pump and resonator/photodiode modules from the baseplate
 and remove the side-bars complete from the modules.  Take care not to
 stress the very thin thermistor wires at any time as replacing the
 thermistors is straightforward, but not much fun.
<p>
<li>Remove the pump beam shaping optics from the pump module (2 screws
 in front, 1 in the rear).  This will reveal the pump diode.
<p>
<li>Make a note of the exact position and orientation of the original diode
 so the replacement can be installed the same way.  There isn't much room
 for movement but the closer the better!  Remove the screw holding the laser
 diode to the module casting.
<p>
<li>Cut the cathode wire/tab flush with the dead laser diode.  Peel off the
 heat-shrink (if present) and unsolder the remains of the cathode tab
 from the wire.  Pull the wire out of the pump module.  Use an Xacto knife or
 single edge razor blade and 3/32" drill bit to scrape/push/remove the glue
 through the casting and clean up the debris.  If the indium foil pad between
 the diode and casting is severely damaged, remove the bits and use a new
 piece when installing the replacement diode.  If in good condition, it can
 be reused.
<p>
<li>Shorten the cathode tab on the new diode so it will fit in without
 the possibility of shorting.  (The original probably had heat-shrink
 tubing for insulation but this is really not essential if you don't
 have any handy.)
<p>
<li>Install the new diode with an indium foil pad.  Align it the same
 as the original and then tighten the screw securely.  If the pad is new,
 take care that it is only as large as the diode so that there is no
 excess to get in the way or short out or something.
<p>
<li>Check the stripped end of the orange wire for damage.  If in decent
 condition, add some rosen core solder to it WELL AWAY FROM THE LASER DIODE
 to avoid contamination.  Put a 1/4" piece of 1/8" heat-shrink tubing over
 the ornage wire (optional, if available) and snake it through the hole in
 the casting so the stripped end aligns alongside the cathode tab.  Solder
 the wire to the tab WITHOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL FLUX - the gold tab does not
 need flux.  If there is any chance of solder smoke (condensed flux) having
 landed on the diode facet, clean it by dripping a few drops of pure acetone
 on it and allowing it to run off an evaporate.  Since this in itself can add
 contimnation, it's best to avoid unless really needed.
<p>
<li>Use some 5-minute Epoxy to seal and secure the wire in the hole so it won't
 tug on the laser diode.  Allow ample time for the Epoxy to set.  Make sure
 the Epoxy doesn't extend more than about 1 mm behond the edge of the hole
 as that would interfere with the side-bar seating flush with the pump
 module.
<p>
<li>Reinstall the pump beam shaping optics tight enough to hold its position
 but still permit some adjustment if necessary.  Now would be a good time to
 confirm that the laser diode is good by powering it with a proper laser
 diode driver and measuring output power if possible.  Just don't let it
 run for more than a few seconds since there is no active cooling as yet.
<p>
<li>Reinstall everything else in reverse order from disassembly.  Make sure
 the indium foil pads are in place under the pump and laser TECs and that
 the modules are tightened down snugly to assure low thermal resistance.
<p>
<li>Install a laser diode protection network (optional).  This laser has
 nothing across the laser diode terminals to minimize the chance of ESD
 damage.  I recommend putting a 100 ohm resistor, 0.1 uF capacitor, and
 1N4148 diode (reverse polarity) in parallel across pins 2 and 7 of the
 DB15 connector.  Just tap into the wires inside the laser head or solder
 to the connector pins (or ground lug for the positive lead).  Short
 pin 2 to 7 externally while soldering.  Note that the 100 ohm resistor,
 the actual diode current will be about 20 mA less than the current supplied
 to the laser head.
<p>
<li>Power up the laser to a current high enough to get some green light
 but not more than 0.75 A (or the maximum current rating of your diode
 if less than this).  Assuming the pump focusing lens in the laser
 module has not been moved, the green lasing threshold will probably be
 at about 0.5 A or less for the typical 1 W pump diode.
<p>
<li>The following two steps may be both need to be performed to get any
 green light especially if adjustments were attempted with the original
 bad diode.  Go back and forth between them to maximize green light:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Adjust the X-Y position of the pump beam shaping for maximum green
  light (or any green light if there is still none at 0.75 A).  There is
  little range on this (unlike the 4601 and similar heads where it
  is significant.  However, it's still enough to go from no lasing to
  maximum power on at least some versions.  On the 4301, it didn't
  have that much effect.  But on the 4501, there was a wide range.
  Once optimized, tighten the three screws locking the pump beam
  shaping optics in place.
<p>
 <li>Loosen the pump focusing lens locking screw and use a narrow tool like
  a dental pick in the adjacent hole to slide it to the position of maximum
  green light.  Tighten the locking screw.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Adjust the position of the output optics to align the beam with the
 laser centerline.  (This is probably not necessary if they were never
 disturbed.)
<p>
<li>Using the laser diode controller of your choice, determine the optimal
 temperature settings and required diode current.
</ol>
<p>
On the 4301 I repaired, there was green light immediately without any
alignment though it did help to maximize output power.  On the 4501,
it took a few seconds of fiddling to get green light.
<p>
However, I discovered that there was no IR blocking filter either before
or after the photodiode/pickoff assembly on the 4301.  (The 4501 seems to
have one.  Perhaps, that's the major difference!)  Without a filter, there was
enough IR leakage, mostly at 1,064 nm, to totally confuse my LaserCheck
power meter.  It was reading several <i>hundred</i> mW at 532 nm for a beam
that was obviously only a few mW of green.  When set at 1,064 nm, it
showed a few mW of IR.  I'm still not sure why the LaserCheck was so
totally confused when set at 532 nm.  Assuming it uses a silicon photodiode,
the sensitivity at 532 and 1,064 nm shouldn't be that different.  I would have
expected some error since both wavelengths are contributing to the reading
(perhaps a factor of 2 or 3) but not a couple orders of magnitude!  After
installing an IR filter, the readings made sense and that is how all
subsequent tests were done.
<p>
Before temperature optimization of the 4301 (both TECs set at 20 &deg;C), 20
mW (rated output power) was obtained at a diode current of about 725 mA.  After
adjusting LD and RES Temps using my LDC-3900, the operating current dropped
to 655 mA which is lower than the current on all of the 46XX/47XXs I've tested
at their rated power.  Further improvement may be possible.
<p>
For the 4501, with the temperatures optimized, 50 mW is achieved at around
910 mA.  This is a slightly higher current than for some of the discrete
50 mW uGreen laser heads, but has similar slope efficiency to the 4301.
<p>
Note that for the these laser heads with MCAs rather than discrete optics, the
temperature behavior is rather different than for the 4601, 4611, 4711, and
4712 units.  Near threshold, small LD Temp changes result in large fluctuations
in power, in addition to the broad wavelength centering peak.  The
RES Temp still has the same ripple and broad peak as the discrete
cavity, but the period of the ripples is larger due to the shorter
KTP.  And, there seems to be generally less variation in output power
due to the ripples.

<h3><A NAME="strjug50t">Testing G50/CDPS532M Laser Heads</A></h3>

These were tests of a pair of what appear to be G50/CDPS532 laser heads.
Although they look similar, the wiring and Flex-PCB differed.  But they
are both single-TEC laser heads.  Based on the existence of yet another
version of the Flex-PCB, there is at least one other type out there.
<p>
One version (#2, below) is shown in <A HREF="ugg50h1.jpg">JDS Uniphase
G50/CDPS532M Laser Head with Closeup of Flex-PCB</A>.
<p>
<PRE>
 ID#  Model  LDI-Thresh  Laser Temp   Pout at LDI
----------------------------------------------------
  1   G50?     350 mA     19.9 &deg;C    25 mW  750 mA
  2   G50?     350 mA     26.1 &deg;C    25 mW  688 mA
</PRE>
<p>
Since there is only a single TEC, finding an optimal operating point
is a compromise between laser (pump) diode wavelength and KTP phase
matching, while maintaining single longitudinal mode.
<p>
Both #1 and #2 were incomplete, missing some or all of the beam collimator
and ghost beam suppression aperture (if used).  So, it's not clear if they
failed some QA test like for SLM (I didn't test that), or became surplus
for some other reason.  The output power of 25 mW at a laser diode
current of 750 mA or less is normal and the beams look decent.

<h3><A NAME="strjuugir">Converting the uGreen to an IR Laser</A></h3>

Although this may seem to be opposite of what most people want, operation
at 1,064 nm may result in much higher output power compared to green.  Depending
on the actual pump diode installed, 200 or 300 mW may be possible.
<p>
It is relatively easy to modify most of these lasers to output at 1,064 nm
instead of 532 nm with similar TEM00 beam quality.  However, note that the
highly desirable single longitudinal mode performance is lost and the uGreen
will operate multi-longitudinal mode even very close to the lasing threshold,
regardless of cavity temperature.  Thus, it is assumed that the KTP must play
a vital role in forcing single longitudinal mode operation.
<p>
All that is required
is to remove the KTP and original OC mirror and replace the OC with one
having a Radius of Curvature (RoC) of 25 to 50 mm and coated S1:98%@1064nm
and S2:AR@1064nm.  The mirror I used was a CASIX NDO-0151-98% with an RoC
of 25 mm (because that's what I had handy!).  Alignment is quite easy,
especially if the laser works before modification and the original OC mirror
is glued flush on the cavity surface.  If there is some green light, that can
be used to do the alignment.  Otherwise, a means of seeing IR will be required
since 1,064 nm is totally invisible.  The simplest is an IR detector card,
followed by an IR viewer.  But a camcorder or video camera may also
be used though its IR filter, if any may need to be removed.
<p>
WARNING: The use of proper laser safety goggles is highly recommended as
the output beam will be totally invisible, reasonably well collimated,
totally invisible, high enough power to present an instant vision
hazard, and depending on your method of alignment, may be pointing in
an direction that isn't what's expected from past experience.
<p>
The following applies directly to the models 4601, 4711, and other uGreen
laser heads of similar construction.  For those that are more thoroughly
glued together, additional chiseling may be needed.  The pump diode will
need to be powered during alignment but for a reasonable amount of time,
no cooling is needed.
<p>
I was able to get over 100 mW of TEM00 1,064 output at 750 mA of pump diode
current (about 400 mW of pump power) from a 4601-010 (rated 10 mW green) uGreen
laser head.  Even more power would likely be possible with a bit of work.  And
while I know the pump diode in this unit is healthy, I don't know if the vanadate is in
tip-top shape as it used parts that had been thrown out. :)  As an
interesting side note, installing the KTP in this laser resulted in
only a fraction of a mW of green, but a reduction in IR output to
65 mW at the same pump current.
<p>
There are two procedures depending on the original condition:
<p>
<b>Procedure 1 - Laser produces some green light:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the cover, output optics, and beam sampler assembly.  Do not
 remove the KTP holder.
<p>
<li>If pump alignment is suspect, power up the laser diode at about 500 mW
 and adjust the pump focusing lens position and KTP for maximum green
 intensity and best beam shape exactly as if doing it for the green laser.
<p>
<li>Remove the OC mirror by using an Xacto knife or other sharp instrument
 to whittle away at the adhesive holding it in place.  If there is significant
 glue under the mirror and it is desired to save it, you will have to
 use Procedure 2 since the use of any solvent would likely contaminate the
 KTP surfaces, if not more.
<p>
<li>Set up the laser either with a micropositioner to hold the new mirror
 (see the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strju4600r">Replacing the OC Mirror
 on a uGreen Laser</A>) or in a vise pointing vertically so a mirror can
 be laid flat on the surface of the cavity.  Put a rim of tape around the
 cavity so the mirror can't fall on the floor! WARNING: IR shooting up!!!
<p>
<li>Power up the pump diode to about 500 mW and adjust the new OC mirror
 until there is some green lasing.  Since this mirror has lower
 reflectivity, there is much less intracavity power and the green beam
 may be very weak.  Just realize that the output at 1,064 nm will be
 strong, possibly dangerously strong.  I measured about 65 mW of 1,064 nm but
 only a fraction of a mW of 532!
<p>
<li>When there is green lasing, back down on the pump current so the laser
 is just above threshold and use 3 or 4 dabs of 5 minute Epoxy or UV cure
 adhesive to fix the mirror in place.  Don't worry if the beam isn't perfect
 at this time.
<p>
<li>Once the glue has hardened, restore the laser to a normal position,
 remove the KTP holder,  and perform pump focusing lens alignment to
 achieve a small, round, TEM00 beam.  Then add some more glue to secure
 the mirror permanently
</ol>
<p>
<b>Procedure 2 - Laser does not produce any green light due to missing or
 damaged KTP:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the cover, output optics, KTP holder (if present), and beam sampler
 assembly.
<p>
<li>Use an Xacto knife or other sharp instrument to whittle away at the
 adhesive holding the output mirror in place.  If it is desired to save
 the mirror, soaking in acetone for a couple days is less likely to result
 in damage, especially if there is glue under the mirror.  Of course,
 this will probably require removing the cavity module entirely and may
 result in contamination of the vanadate so mechanical removal is
 preferred.  Clean up any debris.
<p>
<li>If pump alignment is suspect, power up the laser diode at about 500 mW
 and adjust the pump focusing lens position for maximum amount and
 symmetrical spot of 808 nm making it through the output hole in the
 cavity.  This will maximize the available pump power.  Power down.
<p>
<li>Set up the laser either with a micropositioner to hold the new mirror
 (see the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strju4600r">Replacing the OC Mirror
 on a uGreen Laser</A>) or in a vise pointing vertically so a mirror can
 be laid flat on the surface of the cavity.  Put a rim of tape around the
 cavity so the mirror can't fall on the floor! WARNING: IR shooting up!!!
<p>
<li>Power up the pump diode to about 500 mW and adjust the new OC mirror
 until there is lasing at 1,064 nm using your viewing technique.  Note the
 difference between the diffuse leakage of the pump 808 nm and the very
 small spot of actual 1,064 if actually lasing.
<p>
<li>When there is 1,064 nm lasing, back down on the pump current to just
 above lasing threshold and use 3 or 4 dabs of 5 minute Epoxy or UV cure
 adhesive to fix it in place.   Don't worry if the beam isn't perfect at
 this time.
<p>
<li>Once the glue has hardened, restore the laser to a normal position
 and perform pump focusing lens alignment to achieve a small, round, TEM00
 beam.
</ol>
<p>
The monitor photodiode/beam sampler can probably still be used at 1,064 if
the IR-blocking filter is removed (else, there won't be much of an output
beam!).  And the HYB B controller can then be used to drive the laser,
though recalibration of the photodiode sensitivity will be required.
Note that without the KTP, the output power is a lot less sensitive to
cavity temperature so adjustment may have a small effect but nothing dramatic.
However, since the output lenses are not AR coated for 1,064 nm, their
performance may be less than ideal.  But it still may be worthwhile to
try them.

<h3><A NAME="strjuugpo">Using uGreen Parts for Other Lasers</A></h3>

Both the pump module and resonator/photodiode module in most uGreen lasers
can be used separately.  It probably makes the most sense to use the uGreen
pump with a home-built resonator rather than using a home-built or other
pump module with the uGreen resonator but that may also be useful with
original or replacement parts (i.e., vanadate, KTP, OC mirror).  The pump
beam shaping is matched to the resonator so replacing it will likely result
in suboptimal performance, and the maximum power available may already by
limited by the resonator design.  Simply replacing the diode itself with
a higher power one of the same type (lensed or unlensed) may also not
be optimal as the stripe width and resulting spot size may change.
<p>
However, the diode pump module of many of the uGreen lasers is nearly ideal for
home-built DPSS lasers.  Its output is a collimated beam with up to
0.5 or 1.2 W of output power at 808 nm depending on model.  It includes
a TEC with thermistor temperature sensor and is mounted in a sturdy
base.  Since some uGreen lasers fail due to problems in the resonator
but still have a good pump, this is a way of providing them with a second
life.  It's a simple matter to remove the resonator and photodiode modules
on most uGreen lasers leaving the pump and wiring intact.  There is adequate
space to add a small resonator of your own, or the beam can be taken out
of the front of the laser.
<p>
One problem is that the polarization of the pump beam is oriented at a 45
degree angle which will result in less than optimal absorption in a short
vanadate gain section.  If mounting the new resonator can't be done at
a 45 degree angle, a half wave plate (at 808 nm) can be used to rotate
the polarization.  However, using the 45 degree orientation will enable
any 532 nm green output to be vertically or horizontally polarized
automagically as a result of the Type-II phase matching in the KTP.
<p>
Any of the driver options will still be appropriate including the HYB B
and it should be a simple matter to adapt it to any TEC in your resonator.
<p>
WARNING: The beam from the pump module is well collimated, nearly invisible,
and high power.  This combination means that it not only can cause instant
blindness, but can also damage some types of materials, if not set them
on fire.  Proper laser safety goggles are highly recommended and make
sure the beam terminates in a beam stop if not being used to pump a laser.
<p>
The resonator module can also be used simply for its TEC and small solid
design.  The original vanadate can be removed and replaced
with a normal 3x3x1 mm 1 or 2 percent Nd doped part from CASIX but its
mount will need to be modified or replaced with one that puts the vanadate
at the more normal orientation perpendicular to the optical axis of the
laser but with the C-axis pointing at a 45 degree angle \ viewed from
the front.  Of course, alignment of any vanadate replacement will be
required so the beam is centered in the output hole.  The OC mirror is
also relatively easily replaced as described above.
<p>
Individual parts might also be useful:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser diode:</b> The C-block pump diode will have a maximum power output
 in the range of 0.5 to 1.2 W (50 and 100 um stripe width respectively).
 On most units, there is a fiber lens for fast-axis collimation.  However,
 it seems silly to salvage the diode when the entire pump module is so useful!
<p>
<li><b>Vanadate:</b> This is a 3x3x1 mm crystal, 1 to 2 percent Nd doped,
 with a wedge angle of about 10 degrees.  While the wedge is beneficial
 in preventing unwanted reflections, it also means that the crystal has to
 be mounted at a strange angle to get the beam to come out straight.  And,
 the pump beam has to enter at a strange angle for optimal pump spot
 orientation.  Since it's probably not practical to remove the vanadate
 piece itself anyhow, if reuse is desired, leave it in its mount along
 with the pump focusing lens.
<p>
<li><b>KTP on mount:</b> The KTP is about 3x3x3 mm, AR coated, and should work
 in another short cavity laser.  It is best to leave it in the cylindrical mount.
<p>
<li><b>Photodiode and pickoff window:</b> This is a nice silicon photodiode
 in a 5 mm can package.  The pickoff is a 5 mm or so disk.
<p>
<li><b>Various lenses:</b> These are the pump collimating, pump focusing,
 beam expander, and output collimator lenses.
<p>
<li><b>Various filters:</b> These are the green-blocking filter glued to the
 pump focusing lens and the IR blocking filter glued onto the beam expander
 lens.
<p>
<li><b>TECs:</b> Depending on the particular version, either silver Epoxy or
 low temperature solder is used to bond the TEC to the cavity block.  Those
 using solder may be removed by heating the cavity block (after all other
 useful parts have been removed!) on a hot plate or with a soldering gun
 (with the cavity block clamped between wood blocks or something similar
 that is not highly thermally conductive).  With some luck, the solder
 holding the TEC in place will melt before the TEC falls apart.  Where
 Epoxy is used, I don't know of any practical way to remove the TEC as
 Epoxy can't be easily dissolved and the TEC <i>will</i> fall apart
 before the glue comes loose.  I've tried!  It should be possible to
 determine which type of bond is used by carefully scraping around the
 edge of the seam with a sharp blade.

<h2>Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</h2>

<h3><A NAME="strmghppr">Problems with Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

The following should be useful in evaluating a laser you own or in
determining the condition of a surplus unit.  Some of these characteristics
should be easily detectable by simple tests or via appropriate questions to
the seller.
<p>
There can be several types of problems common with these lasers:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak output but good beam quality</b> This means that the beam or
 beams (in a dual beam laser) are nice and symmetric (round or elongated
 depending on the specifications but not "blobby"), there are no or at
 most very weak ghost spots, and the beam alignment is within normal limits.
 (For single beam lasers, this is with respect to the laser optical axis and
 is spec'd at 5.7 degrees +/- 1 degree horizontally); for dual beam
 lasers, it also refers to the relative alignment of the two beams vertically
 but I could find no specification for this.  By eye, there should not be
 anything that would stand out as being skewed - a couple degrees is probably
 acceptable but not 15 or 20 degrees.)
<p>
 For a new (or low hours laser) the output power should be near or greater
 than the rated value when running at the factory set current in current
 mode, or near the rated value when run in light feedback (constant power)
 mode (if available).  However, pump power for a given pump diode current
 does decrease gradually with hours used so that a
 high mileage laser will likely produce less than rated output
 power at the original pump current in constant current mode.  This could
 be anywhere from slightly lower to near zero, but could still represent
 a stable situation and not impending doom.  So, the laser could still
 run for many hours without a significant change.
<p>
 On lasers using controllers having an active RS232 port (models 58-PSM-290
 and above, perhaps some others), it's possible that the default current
 and/or output power settings have been changed via the control program.
 So, it would be desirable to check these.  Without the RS232 port, there
 is no way to change the default current or power in the field (there are
 no pots inside the controller for this purpose so don't bother looking).
<p>
 For green lasers, if the output power is at least 50 percent of the
 rated value, it's possible that the wrong controller (or one with corrupted
 settings) is being used and the temperature set-points for the pump diode
 and cavity are incorrect.  For blue lasers, the output power may be much
 lower.  Although Melles Griot does not provide any information on changing
 the temperature set-points on these controllers and there are no adjustments
 either internally or via the RS232 port (if present and active), it is
 possible to "fool" the controller into using modified temperature
 set-points
<p>
 The other likely cause is a weak pump diode.  There were a large
 number of these lasers manufactured using a bad run of pump diodes.  Many
 have been replaced under warranty but many more have or will show up on
 eBay or from other surplus sources.  Pump diodes can be replaced.
<p>
 However, even on matched heads and power supplies, there can be some
 drift in laser diode and crystal characteristics over time.  So, some
 fine tuning of the temperature settings may be required to peak the
 output.  On a 58-BLD-605 457 nm blue laser that I have (spec'd power
 output of 400 mW) fine adjustment of the laser diode and crystal
 temperature set-points resulted in the power increasing from 320 mW to
 a steady 380 mW with over 400 mW appearing during warmup.  So, there
 may be room for improvement.
<p>
<li><b>Poor beam quality:</b> This may include misshapened beam(s) and/or
 excessive ghost spots and/or shifts in beam alignment.  Where no one has
 gone inside the laser head and attempted any alignment, a possible cause is
 damage to the laser cavity optics, probably a result of partial delamination
 of one or more optical contacted or optical bonded joints.
 Delamination will result in the interface between optically contacted
 surfaces no longer being reflection-free, reducing output power and
 stability, and generating multiple ghost spots.
 For dual-beam lasers, in addition to ghost spots, delamination of the
 backward traveling beam reflecting mirror will result in an angle shift
 so that the two beams will no longer have the same vertical alignment.
 And where the delaminated optic also serves as a heatsink for the
 vanadate, cooling will no longer be adequate.  With luck, the <i>only</i>
 symptoms will be low output power, reduced stability, ghost spots, and
 messed up beam alignment.  But without luck, the vanadate may crack and
 self destruct.
<p>
 For example, see <A HREF="mghpbms1.jpg">Mishapened Misaligned Beams of
 Melles Griot High Power Green DPSS Laser</A>.  This photo is of laser #2,
 below but is similar to the appearance of the beams of laser #1 as well
 (though they were much weaker).  Compare it to the beams in
 <A HREF="58bld-1.jpg">Melles Griot 58-BLD-605
 Dual Beam Blue DPSS Laser</A> which are clean and well aligned.
 In all fairness, I don't know positively that this laser has problems,
 but its beam characteristics do stand out in a negative way compared to
 most others I've seen.
<p>
 Another example is shown in <A HREF="mghpbms2.jpg">Excessive Ghost Beams
 of Melles Griot High Power Blue DPSS Laser</A>.  This is a 58-BLS-305
 laser that is supposed to have a single beam.  Normally, there might a 1 or
 2 faint ghost spots, but 8 bright ghost spots and more than double that number
 of faint ones is a sign of possible trouble.  Even so, this particular
 laser meets output power specifications (200 mW).  And apparently, the
 previous owner had simply installed a stop (aperture plate) to block
 the ghosts!  It is not known if these ghosts were present when the laser
 was new or developed gradually or suddenly.  It's quite possible that
 if the power in the ghost spots is less them 1 or 2 percent of the power
 of the beam(s) and that power is close to the spec'd power, the ghosts
 may be normal.  Digital photos can be deceiving.
<p>
 I've heard of people offering to repair the optics in these lasers for a
 fixed price, but I'm suspect of such claims as optical contacting isn't
 something that can be done in your basement or even a typical optics lab.
 The pieces that need to be joined are only a few millimieters in size,
 easily damaged, and the space in which to work may be quite limited
 (depending on laser model).   Absolute cleanliness is required.  The
 surfaces must be free of all dust and contamination and a filtered air
 environment like a cleanroom or glovebox is required to have any chance of
 success and decent life.  Even if there is an agreement to charge
 nothing if they fail, the effort could render the optics in the
 laser totally useless such that even Melles Griot won't touch it.
<p>
 Note that poor beam shape and alignment in itself isn't necessarily a
 problem for applications like laser shows where the beams will be put
 through a beam expander/collimator.  After this, the degradation may
 be minimal, if detectable at all.  It's the possibility of total failure
 in short order that's the real issue.
<p>
<li><b>No output:</b> Assuming the controller powers up without
 error, it's possible the laser diode is either dead with little or
 not pump output, or totally shorted.  Testing for a very shorted diode
 only requires a DMM which uses a low voltage for resistance measurement.
 A new diode will probably test open in both directions.  However, a high
 mileage or marginal diode might have a reduced resistance but still be
 usable.  But a shorted diode will show a few ohms or less in both
 directions.  Note that the cause of a shorted diode can not be determined
 conclusively unless an obvious failure is found in the controller, but
 is probably more likely to be due to a sample defect or
 environmental factors as the older versions of these lasers in particular
 are not well sealed.
</ul>
<p>
For lasers of unknown pedigree, another thing to note is the model number.
If it contains an "R" (as in 58-GSDR-309), the laser had been back to Melles
Griot for evaluation due to a problem like low output or bad beam quality.
It may have been repaired, or the repair may have been declined due to the
high cost and the laser was simply returned unchanged.  Given the high cost
of repair from Melles Griot, the latter is quite likely.  (The cost of
evaluation alone is around $500!)  Many eBay lasers show up with the R. :)
Note that the lack of an "R" doesn't necessarily mean the laser <i>wasn't</i>
tested by Melles Griot for a problem, only that the sticker was left
unchanged!
<p>
Although the controller itself could be defective, this doesn't appear to be
very common.  The design is relatively simple and they are well protected for
both open and shorted conditions.  But see the procedure below for testing.
<p>
I have evaluated several 3 W (rated) lasers which were a mix of really
old units (1997) identical to the original Laser Power Corporation design,
and newer units (2000/2001) which look like the modern Melles Griot lasers
currently being sold.  All except #5 had a model number of 58-GSDR-309, the
"R" indicating that they had been back to Melles Griot for evaluation.
Laser #5 was a 58-GSD-309 which may have simply failed and never been
sent to Melles Griot, or they may simply have not updated the sticker. :)
Here are the case histories for five of these lasers (O=older laser,
N=newer laser):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unit #1 (O): The output power was very low at 80 to 100 mW, declining to
 50 mW or less after warming up.  The beam shape was decent but there were
 ghost spots.  Adjustment of the temperature set-points could maintain the
 power at 100 mW or so.  Alignment of the laser cavity with respect to
 the focusing lens showed no improvement.  Moving this focusing lens and entire
 laser cavity to another laser head (Unit #3) with known good pump diode
 showed no improvement and this pump diode tested good.
<p>
 A close examination of the laser cavity revealed a rainbow interference
 pattern on the rear surface of the vanadate.  Gently touching the vanadate
 with a toothpick caused it to fall off entirely.  The cause was almost
 certainly delamination of the optical contacted or optical bonded joint
 between the vanadate and backing plate.
<p>
 Problems with optical contacting are well known, especially for microchip
 lasers where the contacted area is small (this is about 5x5mm).  I'm not
 really sure what technique is used here as there isn't even any glue along
 the edges to keep the crystals together.  It might be a form of optical
 bonding though I believe it to be simple optical contacting.
<p>
 For these lasers, it appears as though the sandwich was made prior to
 being glued in to the metal frame of the laser cavity.  Just gluing
 or clamping the vanadate back in place will result in both poor optical
 performance due to reflections at the interface between the vanadate and
 backing plate, and insufficient thermal contact likely resulting in
 cracking of the vanadate (as I found out when I attempted this).
<p>
<li>Unit #2 (N): The output power was decent at 1.9 W but the beam
 shape is diagonally elongated with ghost spots and the alignment of
 the two beams in the vertical is not good as shown in
 <A HREF="mghpbms1.jpg">Mishapened Misaligned Beams of
 Melles Griot High Power Green DPSS Laser</A>.  Alignment was attempted
 by adjusting the horizontal position of the pump diode assembly.  This
 resulted in a slight improvement in beam shape at the expense of about
 0.1 W in output power.
<p>
 The symptoms may represent an early stage of delamination of the
 vanadate crystal from its backing plate as with Unit #1.  However, this
 laser appears stable with no change in performance during the course of
 testing.
<p>
<li>Unit #3 (O): Powering up this unit showed just a red glow exciting the
 output aperture.  Removing the cover revealed that it was missing the
 laser cavity entirely. :(  However, the pump diode was healthy and
 was used to test Unit #1.  I should have been suspicious when all but
 2 of the case screws were missing! :) I have no idea who was inside.
<p>
<li>Unit #4 (O): The output power was somewhat low at 1.3 W but the beam
 quality is good.  Temperature set-point were checked and found to be close to
 optimal with at best a 0.1 W increase in output power possible, not done.
<p>
 With good optics, the likely cause is a tired pump diode.
<p>
<li>Unit #5 (N): There was absolutely no output.  A test of the laser diode
 revealed that it was shorted.  After the controller was tested to confirm
 that it wasn't the likely cause of the short, the laser diode from Unit #1
 was transplanted into it and the temperature set-points were adjusted
 with the result that the output power is now 2.8 to 3 W with good beam
 quality.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpdt">Repairing a Melles Griot 58-GSD-309</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Realistically, the probability of significantly improving output power
on any of these lasers without a transplant assuming the controller is
matched to the laser head and operation is probably small.  The only
likelihood of misalignment would be if the entire laser head were dropped
or shot out of a cannon. :)  Everything is either very well glued or screwed
in place.  My working hypothesis right now is that if the beam(s) look good
- nice, round, with minimal ghost spots - then low power is a pump diode or
controller problem.  If the beam(s) look messed up and/or significantly out
of line, it's probably a laser cavity/optics problem.  The latter is not
likely to be repairable.  While simple contamination - dirty optics - is
theoretically possible, the (newer) versions of these lasers manufactured
by Melles Griot are reasonably well sealed so this shouldn't happen.
<p>
And, if considering the purchase of one of these types of lasers used, as in
general with surplus lasers, don't assume that what you get will necessarily
meet new specifications.  So, a laser rated at 3 W may only produce 1.5 or
2 W.  But if that is a stable situation, it's likely you will still
have gotten a good deal since there can still be a lot of life remaining.

<h3><A NAME="strmghpt">Testing the Controllers for Melles Griot High Power
 DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

Here is some information on checking out controllers for the 58-GSD-309,
58-BLD-605, and similar lasers without requiring a laser head, where the
laser head is suspected of being defective, or where the condition of the
controller is unknown and thus connecting it to a laser head would be risky.
Note that a defective controller doesn't appear to be a common problem
for a dead or weak laser but testing is easy enough so it's probably worth
doing if in doubt.
<p>
These procedures will confirm that the major control loops
are functional and determine the approximate set-points for each one.
They have been developed from measurements on a 58-PSM-254
controller (older type) and inspection of a 58-PSM-281 controller (newer
type).  To run the controllers without the laser head, all that is needed
is for the interlocks to be in place.  Then a suitable load can be installed
on each output to be tested.  Having no load on the other outputs won't cause
problems or affect measurements on the one being tested.
<p>
Interlocks on both the laser head and user interface connectors must be
present for the controller to power up.  Refer to the appropriate sections
(above) for pinout information.
<p>
If any unusual behavior occurs, press the "Off" button to instantly shut off
all outputs (LD current, LD TEC, Xtal TEC), though the fan will continue
to run for a minute or so.  Pulling the plug also works and shouldn't cause
damage to anything since no laser head is attached for these tests.
<p>
WARNING: These units are line connected with potentially lethal voltages
present when AC power is present (regardless of whether they are actually
operating) and for several minutes after removing all AC power (while the
main filter capacitor is charged).  They should not be run with the cover
removed unless absolutely necessary.  The low voltage B+ is present a few
seconds after the keylock switch is turned on with the interlocks in place
and takes a minute or so to discharge after power is removed.
Everything on the external connectors is
isolated and should not be a shock hazard, though the relatively high
available current can result in burnt or welded contacts or screwdrivers.
To avoid accidental short circuits, change connections only with power off.
The power supplies appear have decent fault protection but don't count on it.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>+12 VDC fan power:</b> Apply power to the controller, turn on the
 keylock switch (if present), wait a few seconds for the main power supply
 to start up, and press the "On" button.  The controller fan should come on
 immediately and the +12 VDC should be present on the laser head connector.
 Pressing the "Off" button does not turn off the fans immediately, there is
 a minute or so delay.
<p>
<li><b>LD current:</b> My load is 2 high current (50 A) silicon diodes in
 series, in series with a DC current meter of 50 A full scale (30 A should
 be sufficient).  (The diodes probably aren't essential as these controllers
 appear perfectly happy driving into a short circuit.  In fact, one way to
 detect a shorted pump diode is to measure AC line current - it will be
 about 1/2 the value present with a good pump diode.  But the series diodes
 won't hurt and are a more realistic test.)  Power up as above.  After a few
 seconds, the LD current should begin to slowly ramp up to the operating
 value.  This takes a minute or two.  The final current will depend on the
 model and specific unit but 15 to 20 A is probably typical
 for 3 W green or 400 mW blue lasers; lower power lasers will have a lower
 LD operating current.
<p>
<li><b>LD temperature:</b> I used a large TEC for the load, but a low value,
 high power resistor should also be adequate.  The voltage is monitored
 across the load.  The procedures differ slightly depending on controller
 type:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The drive circuitry in older controllers like the 58-PSM-254 is
  unipolar and only capable of providing current in the
  cooling direction (positive to the red wire on the TEC).  Thus, they assume
  that some heat has to be removed - there is no way to go even to 0 current.
  So, it is not possible to simply use a TEC as a load with a thermistor sensor
  without heating the TEC by some other means.  Instead, a 20K ohm rheostat
  is connected between the LD thermistor pins and set to 20K.  Once the
  controller is powered up as above, after a few seconds, the temperature
  control loop will become active.  At 20K ohms, there will be minimum
  current to the TEC (though it's not zero).  Very slowly decrease the
  value of the pot while monitoring the TEC voltage.  As the set-point
  value is approached, the voltage will start increasing.  At first, it
  just jumps a bit each time the pot is changed and then returns to the
  the  minimum value.  But just beyond where the set-point is reached,
  it will continue to climb.  Once this happens, power down and
  measure the rheostat resistance, which will be close to the thermistor
  resistance set-point.  If desired, convert the resistance value to
  temperature using the following table which is from the Melles Griot
  operation manual for the 58-BLD-605 laser:

  </PRE>
<p>
  If the resistance is
  reduced too far, the controller will shut off its outputs due to what
  it thinks is overtemperature.  The "Off" button must then be pressed to
  shut down completely.  Once the fan stops, the controller can be restarted.
<p>
 <li>For newer controllers like the 58-PSM-281, the TEC drive circuitry
  appears to be bipolar (it looks like an H-bridge) and can thus both cool
  and heat the TECs.  Thus, providing a load that consists of a TEC
  with a 10K thermistor sensor should result in a stable control loop.
  However, using a similar procedure to the one above will enable the actual
  set-point resistance to be determined easily rather than having to measure
  the temperature.  The only change is that the set-point location is where
  the drive voltage switches polarity and continues to increase in the
  opposite direction.  I don't know whether the controller will shut down
  if it senses too high a resistance (too cold).  If it shuts down or won't
  start up, set the pot to around 10K ohms and work quickly to locate the
  switch-over point.
 </ul>
<p>
 These controllers all appear to use a peculiar slowly sampled feedback
 loop for the TECs.  (The thermistor sensors go to an analog multiplexer
 inside the controller, not direct to any op-amp circuitry.)  The response
 is not instantaneous and changes occur in spurts rather than continuously.  
 Make small changes to the rheostat setting and wait for the loop to settle
 down.  It may also be best to approach the set-point resistance one or more
 times in both directions and average the results. 
<p>
 Due to the sampling, it isn't possible to monitor the thermistor resistance
 (via voltage drop assuming a constant current) with a multimeter while the
 controller is operating.  An oscilloscope might work.  However, as soon as
 the "Off" button is pressed (and before the fans stop), the head cable can
 be unplugged to measure the thermistor resistances directly before the
 temperatures change very much.
<p>
<li><b>Xtal temperature:</b> The procedure and behavior is very similar to
 that for LD temperature except that the controller may not shut down if it
 senses a temperature that is outside the normal operating range.
</ul>
<p>
The circuitry for each of the control loops is on the left side of the bottom
PCB towards the rear of the controller.  From back to front they are: LD
current, LD temperature, and Xtal temperature.  Each has an LED which
will be on whenever the control loops are active.  The LED brightness is
roughly proportional to the output voltage in each case.  On some
controllers, there is also an LED on the B+ line (on the right side
near the back).
<p>
Some units actually label the driver circuits on the main PCB (what a
concept!) but call the LD circuit "LED", like the laser diode is just
one really really big LED. :)
<p>
Assuming these tests show the controller behaving as expected, it should
be safe to connect the matching laser head.  Where the controller is being
tested because the laser doesn't work as expected, the problems are likely
in the laser head, or the laser head is not matched to the controller.
<p>
The unipolar nature of the TEC drivers isn't surprising on the older
controllers considering that it would appear they always operate at full power.
For example, for a 3 W green laser, if the laser diode is running at 18 A,
it is dissipating about 26 W of heat while outputting about 10 W of light.
Most of the 10 W of light is being absorbed by the vanadate crystal, of
which about 5 to 7 W needs to be removed as heat (the remaining being
the useful 3 W green output and losses in the laser cavity).  However, a
problem may arise where the laser is operating at much lower than rated
power resulting in even the minimum current from the LD and Xtal drivers
producing too much cooling.  The newer controllers which allow for power
adjustment likely have bipolar drivers for both the LD and Xtal TECs.
<p>
Some controllers also have a single HEX-digit readout on the PCB toward the
front and visible through the ventilation slots.  This probably shows
status or error codes but I have no idea what they mean.  There is also
a 26 pin IDC connector labeled "Display" near the front, possibly for a more
elaborate front panel or diagnostic unit.
<p>
I tested three 58-PSM-254 controllers in the manner describe above with
the following results:
<p>
<PRE>
   ID#   LD Current   LD Thermistor   Xtal Thermistor
  ----------------------------------------------------
    1      18.0 A         8.0K             13.6K
    2      18.5 A         7.5K             14.0K
    3      19.0 A         8.6K             13.2K
</PRE>
<p>
The thermistor values are kind of reversed from what I'd expect (or at least
what would be desirable) but I double checked the wiring.  It's usually
desirable to have the LD temperature be cooler than the 29 &deg;C to
32 &deg;C corresponding to these resistance values but those must be what
were needed to tune the wavelength to 808 nm.  And the Xtal (KTP) is usually
run warmer.  However, a 58-BLD-605 with a 58-PSM-290 that has the LD and Xtal
thermistor resistances available via its RS232 port was even more extreme -
5.3K and 13.0K, respectively.

Having both Interlock jumpers in place is necessary and sufficient to get
the controller to turn on its green Power LED.  However, I do not know if
attempting to actually run the controller with only the Interlock jumpers
in place has any potential for damage.  I assume it's smart enough to simply
abort and turn on its fault LED but haven't confirmed this.
<p>
The "Aux Connector" has 6 positions and is just hanging under the cable
shroud.  On lasers that have a monitor photodiode, it may connect to a
a small PCB with a photodiode preamp on it.  I could not determine how
the pins are numbered on the Aux Connector since it is hard to see buried
under the pile of wires.  One of the other pins on this connector goes
inside the laser head, which may be the input.
<p>
This particular laser does not have a monitor photodiode so I was unable
to determine which pins would be used for that but they may be associated
with the Aux connector.
<p>
Most of the unlisted Signal Connector pins actually do go inside the
laser head but are not used on this model at least.

<h4><A NAME="strmghpp3">Pinouts for Older Laser Heads</A></h4>

These pinouts are for really old, somewhat ugly, laser heads which were
probably carryovers from the original Laser Power Corporation designs,

actually say "Laser Power".  Unlike the Melles Griot designs which
have permanently attached cables, these have two DB15-size connectors
mounted one above the other on the laser head.  Each has 2 fat pins on
the ends and 5 normal pins in between.

<h3><A NAME="strmghpat">Adjustment of Temperature Set-Points in Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

The temperature settings for the pump diode and crystal are critical to
achieve optimum performance from DPSS lasers.  These Melles Griot lasers
are preset at the factory with what should be the best ones when running
at rated power.  However, as components (particularly the pump diode) age,
the settings will no longer be optimal.  In fact, it may not be possible
to achieve rated power even by increasing pump current if the added current
is pushing the temperature further away from optimal.
<p>
When the newer controllers are run using the Melles Griot supplied control
panel software, the temperature set-points and measured temperature of the pump
diode, cavity/crystals, and baseplate may be displayed but not changed.  (The
version I have actually displays the thermistor sensor resistances, not
temperature, but that turns out to be better as will be seen below.)  There
is a password protected mode documented in the software operation manual but
this only allows the current operating parameters like Run and Standby laser
diode current to be saved so they will be used as the default whenever
the laser is powered up.  There is a second password that provides access to
a "Factory Mode" setup screen allowing the temperature set-points and other
critical parameters to be adjusted and saved.  But
I have been totally unsuccessful in extracting any specific information
from Melles Griot.  Their excuse is that "You might damage the laser and
we wouldn't want that to happen".  There is some validity to this concern
since any protection from stupidity like exceeding the laser diode current
limit or setting its temperature to a diode destroying value is non-existent
when in this mode.  And of course they *would* be very
happy to evaluate the condition of the laser for a non-trivial fee, or
even better, sell me a new one for an even more non-trivial fee. :)
<p>
The Factory Mode software also isn't exactly polished: Entered values,
locally stored values, and those being used by the controller may
differ; the screen may not update the operating parameters in
real-time; there's no help available; and it may crash itself or
crash Windows.  Aside from these minor quirks, it is extremely
user-friendly. :)  And I disavow everything in the previous paragraph. :-)
<p>
The temperature settings are stored in NVRAM like all the other parameters.
Even the very old 58-GSD-254 power supply I've seen had only one
pot and it didn't appear to be associated with the operating parameters
at all.  On that controller, there is probably no way to input data of
any kind via the external interfaces and I have no idea if it is possible
even from inside the box.  The newer 58-PSM-284 has 3 pots but they are
not anywhere near the circuits for temperature control.
<p>
So, if you don't know the password to access the factory setup screen,
here is a scheme to fake out the controller by adding simple circuits
to allow the LD and Xtal thermistor resistances seen by the controller to
be tuned slightly.  For a general test adapter, construct a widget
with a DB25M on one side and DB25F on the other (or, the special DB37-size
D-sub connectors for the older controllers).  Jumper all pins 1:1 except
for the LD and Xtal thermistors, and provide a means of connecting to these
on both sides, as well as to the thermistor common(s).  Add tie points so
that two instances of the circuit below can be soldered into your fakeout
widget.  (I don't recommend using sockets as bad things may happen if a
part came loose while the laser was on.)  Where only a single laser is
involved or after the set-point adjustment has been shown to help, the
required circuitry can all be installed inside the laser head connector head
shell.

<p>
R1 should be a 10 or 20 turn pot to provide for precise control.
The values of R1 and R2 must be selected for the desired tuning range based
on the set-point resistance (Rs) found from the software display.  So
before installing R1 and R2, run the control program (without the fakeout
widget in place) and record the values of Rs for the LD and Xtal thermistors.
(Baseplate temperature has no effect on performance and it can only be
monitored anayhow.)
<p>
For example, if Rs is found to be near 10,000 ohms (25 &deg;C), to achieve an
adjustment range of about +/-1 &deg;C, select R1 to be 1K and R2 to be 240K.
For other values of Rs, and/or desired adjustment ranges, R1 and R2 will be
different.  However, selecting R1 to be Rs/10 and R2 to be 24*Rs should
work well enough.  In fact, +/-1 &deg;C may be 100 times the range that
is actually needed to compensate for slight component drift.  1/100th of a
degree may indeed be more than enough.  You can do the math for that. :)
<p>
Before running your shiny new fakeout widget with the laser, attach a
pot or resistance substitution box to it (in place of the sensor) that has been
set for exactly the value of Rs in each case.  Then adjust R1 so that the
resistance seen by the controller will be the same.  That way, the initial
set-points will be identical to the factory set-points and you can go from there.
<p>
When doing the actual fine tuning, have the laser in constant current
mode and monitor output power.  That way, no matter what happens, the
pump diode current won't increase to excessive levels to try to compensate
for your mischief.
<p>
Of course, keep in mind that if you are using the control program, it
will now be displaying the modified thermistor resistance and you'll
have to calculate the actual resistance to determine the true temperature.
But with such a small adjustment range, it shouldn't be possible to go into
dangerous territory.
<p>
Where it is known that the temperature is too low or too high, the simple
circuit can be simplified even further to a single resistor or rheostat,
though the combination of a rheostat and fixed resistor is recommended to
limit the adjustment range.  The resistance needs to be in series with
the thermistor to raise the temperature or in parallel with it to lower
the temperature.
<p>
I have now implemented this kludge, err, hack, err, work-around :) on the
laser that had a pump diode transplant described in the section:
<A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpdt">Repairing a Melles Griot 58-GSD-309</A>.
I have also used just a rheostat (in series or parallel) to vary the
temperature set-points in a similar manner without problems.  With a
modest adjustment range - more than adequate to fine tune the temperature
settings, there should be virtually no risk of damage to the laser as long
the temperature isn't forced to go too low or too high, and there are no bad
or intermittent connections.  And it's always possible to remove
the circuits if they don't do anything useful.  But don't push your
luck - you don't get something for nothing with this simple circuit.
As the value of R1 is increased and the value of R2 is decreased to
boost the adjustment range, the effective gain of the temperature
control loop is reduced.  At some point, the system may complain
or do strange things though I suspect there is a wide range over which
it will work just fine.  The only reason to justify going to a wider
range is if the laser head and controller are not matched, in which
case a more sophisticated approach may be needed since the set-point
temperatures could differ by a very large amount.  However, having
said that, the circuits performed just fine in the diode transplant
unit and that required significant modifications to both the LD
and Xtal temperature, probably because the controller wasn't
matched to the laser head and transplanted diode.

<h3><A NAME="strmghpal">Adjustment of Laser Diode Current in Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

Newer controllers provide for laser diode current adjustment and a
programmable pulse mode using their RS232 port.  There is also two level
(TTL) modulation via the user interface connector.  Thus, what follows really
isn't needed for them, but could be more convenient than requiring a PC to
adjusting laser power.
<p>
Older controllers do not provide a way of changing anything.
You can have any power level desired as long as it is 0.0 W or
the rated value for the laser. :)  Though the unipolar drive to the TECs
used in these early systems limits the range over which the LD and Xtal
TECs can operate, it may still be possible to provide some adjustment of LD
current directly to vary output power, and maybe even modulation capability,
without modifying the controller.
<p>
For the following approach to work for power adjustment, the laser must be
operating in constant current mode.  In constant output power mode (if
available on your laser), the controller would attempt to compensate for any
changes made externally.  If tighter control of output power is desired, the
monitor photodiode signal would need to be intercepted and modified to vary the
set-point of the feedback loop.  This is left as an exercise for the student.
<p>
For output power adjustment, a way must be provided to bypass current
around the laser diode.  Since the laser diode has a nearly constant voltage
drop and the controller is a constant current source, nearly all that is
bypassed simply subtracts from the total current going to the laser diode.
Since nothing is quite perfect, there will be some error and the controller
will see a small change in voltage, but for slow adjustment, there should
not be any stability issues.  The simplest approach
would use a high power resistor with a value of approximately 2/I and power
dissipation rating more than 2*I where I is the desired reduction in
current to the laser diode assuming a 2 V drop across it.  However, high
power low ohm rheostats don't exist except in University EE course
homework assignments. :)  So, the circuit will have to be just a bit
more complex:

 Return o-----+---------+--------------+--------+--------o LD-
</PRE>
<p>
Note that the +5 VDC supply must be isolated and probably cannot be easily
derived from any voltages present in the controller since LD- is probably
not the controller common.  It should be regulated, or be produced from a
higher voltage supply or DC wall adapter using a regulator IC like a 7805.
<p>
Since this circuit can only reduce current to the laser diode, it should
be fairly low risk.  If the 2N3055 were ideal, the range would be from 0 A
to approximately 10 A bypassed around the laser diode, or from 18 A to around
8 A through the laser diode for a system with a default LD current of 18 A.
This should provide a reasonably wide range of output power, possibly more
than is needed as the lower limit may be below the lasing threshold,
particularly for blue lasers.  In addition, at the low end of the LD
current range, the heat load on the Xtal TEC may be too small for the
unipolar driver circuits to regulate properly.  The LD temperature loop
is probably stable even below its lasing threshold, but the Xtal temperature
may be lower than its set-point value.  Thus, it would be desirable to monitor
the TECs when testing to confirm that they are not running at or near
minimum voltage, which would indicate that they may be getting too
cold.  Where the controller has bipolar TEC drive, this should not
be a problem.
<p>
Nothing in the circuit is critical but Q2 and Q3 should be installed on a most
excellent heatsink.  If a wider range is desired, paralleling additional
2N3055s with separate emitter resistors or the use of better transistors is
preferred over simply pushing 2N3055s to much higher current.  If only a
5 A range is desired, a single 2N3055 should suffice.
<p>
For modulation, a digital or analog signal can be introduced in place
of the DC voltage.  The value of C2 should be reduced to allow for the
desired frequency response.  However, it is not known whether the controller
will be stable with high speed modulation since there will be a small amount
of ripple making its way back to the driver.  For modulation above a certain
frequency, running in constant power mode may be even acceptable if the
controller regulates the average output power but there may be more risk of
laser diode damage and this is probably not recommended without a thorough
understanding of the LD current source design.
<p>
A slightly more elaborate circuit using a power MOSFET and op-amp would
provide more accurate current control though it's probably not required.  See,
for example, <A HREF="hcbp1sch.gif">High Power Laser Diode Current Bypass</A>.
Q1 in this circuit can be any high current low Rds N channel MOSFET.
There are many MOSFETs with lower Rds than the IRF540 but it is readily
available, inexpensive, and should be acceptable on a good heatsink.  The
op-amp needs to have its input range include the negative supply rail.

<h3><A NAME="strmghpda">Alignment of Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

The pump assembly (laser diode and fiber coupler/beam shaper), focusing
lens, and laser cavity are on separate mounting platforms which are held in
place by cap screws.  So, adjusting their horizontal position and orientation
with respect to each-other is relatively straightforward and can be
accomplished without anything more than appropriate hex wrenches and a laser
power meter.  However, not much can be done easily about any vertical
misalignment since there aren't any adjustments for vertical position or
orientation.
<p>
Since none of this is likely to change on its own, the only
real need to attempt any alignment would be if the laser were whacked
severely or if the laser diode platform or optics were transplanted
between similar laser heads.
<p>
Horizontal alignment is easy enough to do by hand with relatively low
risk.  Here is a procedure that is known to work on green lasers at least.  It
is best to do this with the laser operated at low power but it can be done even
on the controllers that have no such option.  Just take appropriate care,
especially with your eyes.
<p>
WARNING: Depending on type and model, up to 30 watts at 808 nm may be produced
by the pump diode assembly.  For a green laser, a few hundred mW at 1,064 nm
and several W at 532 nm may be present, with the latter two wavelengths
in collimated beams exiting the laser cavity.  For a blue laser,
there may be several hundred mW at 914 nm and 457 nm in collimated beams.
For an IR laser, there may be several watts at 1,064 nm in collimated beams.
Take extreme care.
<p>
CAUTION: The crystals and optics inside the laser cavity are mounted using
some form of optical contacting.  This results in a high quality low loss
interface between optical surfaces, but is not very robust.  In these Melles
Griot lasers, there doesn't even appear to be any additional support like
edge glue.  Therefore, avoid even thinking about going near or touching
the vanadate sandwich (all models) or KTP sandwich (older models).  If any
of these comes apart, there is no practical way of repairing it.
<p>
The following assumes that the position and orientation of all three platforms
is suspect - skip the appropriate steps if you know that some parts have not
been touched.  A continuous reading laser power meter should be positioned so
that it intercepts the output of the laser (one or both beams in a dual beam
laser) but far enough away that any leakage of the pump wavelength doesn't
significantly affect the reading.
<p>
<ol>
<li>With power off, remove the focusing lens from the laser head.  Remove
 the the laser cavity but since it is still attached by the Xtal thermistor
 wires, just set it off to one side.
<p>
<li>Loosen the four (4) mounting screws for the laser diode/fiber coupler/beam
 shaper platform just enough to allow its position to be adjusted.
<p>
<li>Power up the laser and once the pump beam is visible shining on the
 interior of the end of the laser head, adjust the platform position so
 that it is centered from side-to-side and the beam is centered around
 the output aperture.  Tighten the screws.  Power down the laser.
<p>
<li>Replace the focusing lens with its screws just barely snug.  Power up
 the laser and adjust the focusing lens position so that (1) the beam is
 centered around the output aperture and (2) the lens is roughly halfway
 forward and back.  Tighten its screws.  Power down the laser.
<p>
 CAUTION: During this time, the Xtal TEC is being driven open-loop since
 the temperature sensor is not in thermal contact with it.  Work quickly.
<p>
<li>Replace the laser cavity with its screws just barely snug.  Power up the
 laser and adjust the position and orientation of the laser cavity for
 maximum output power on your laser power meter and the output beam (or
 main output beam if a dual beam laser) aligned with the center line of
 the laser head.  Tighten its screws.
<p>
<li>After allowing a few minutes for the Xtal temperature to stabilize, loosen
 the <b>focusing lens</b> screws and readjust its position both side-to-side
 and forward and back for maximum output.  This may not be necessary but will
 allow adjustment without affecting the Xtal temperature as much as adjusting
 the laser cavity.
<p>
<li>Loosen the pump assembly mounting screws slightly and check that it's
 horizontal alignment is still optimal.  Tighten the screws slightly.
<p>
 There is a <i>very</i> small amount of vertical movement of the pump beam
 possible by varying the relative tightness of the front and back
 screws.  Carefully adjust these to do a final peak of output power but don't
 tighten either set to much - you may crunch the TECs and that could ruin your
 whole day.  But that small vertical adjustment might be enough to correct a
 minor misalignment.
<p>
<li>Carefully place the laser cover in position.  The measured output power
 will drop slightly since there is (or should be) a filter to block the IR
 wavelengths (except 1,064 nm for IR lasers).  For a 3 W green laser running
 at full power, the output power as measured on a thermal laser power meter
 will drop by 100 mW or more.)  Run the laser up to full power if it wasn't
 there already.  Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize and then check
 the output power to see how well you did.
</ol>
<p>
Where the maximum output power does <b>not</b> coincide with best beam shape,
damage to the optics, possibly partial delamination of one or more joints,
is likely.  On a laser with good optics, peaking of optical power alone is
a sufficient criteria for best alignment.  However, on a marginal one, it
may be necessary to reach a compromise between maximum output power and
best beam quality.

<h3><A NAME="strmghpdd">Testing the Pump Diode in Melles Griot High
 Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

For systems with newer controllers with a functioning RS232 interface (e.g.,
58-PSM-290 and above), the controller will suffice.  This is actually better
than about any other approach since the diode can be tested in situ, without
changing any wiring, and the controller has good current adjustment and
voltage monitoring capabilities.  For older controllers, only normal
operating current can be used but at least if the current ramps up slowly
during initial power-on, diode voltage and output power can be monitored
with respect to current during this period.  The following assumes a newer
controller.
<p>
<b>Without taking the cover off the laser head:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Power up the system and enable the laser with the keylock switch, but
 do not press the "Laser On" pushbutton.
<p>
<li>Run the Melles Griot software, connect to the controller, and select
 the "Monitor" screen.
<p>
<li>Hit the "Laser On" button or the "ON" button on the screen.
<p>
<li>Observe both the "Laser Voltage" and "Laser Current".  These are the
 voltage across the pump diode and pump current, respectively.  Why can't
 they say this?
<p>
<li>The Laser Voltage should exceed 1.6 V very quickly (at low amps) and
 continue climbing slowly until 1.7 or maybe even a bit higher.  The
 rise should be monotonic with respect to current.
</ul>
<p>
A shorted diode will never reach 1.6 V or may drop down as the current
is increased, or at random.  Any value from 0 to 1.5 V at 10 A or above
is an indication of a shorted diode.
<p>
<b>Inside the laser head:</b>
<p>
WARNING: High power IR (808 nm and possibly 1,064 nm) may be present.
Although the diffuse reflections are generally not dangerous, take
reasonable precautions and don't put your remaining good eyeball up
against the laser diode!
<p>
The cover is held in place by 8 hex screws, 4 along each side, and
the 2 Philips-head screws at the top-rear.  The 8 hex screws are the
ones that are a bit higher than the other 10.  On at least one laser,
the hex screw at the front-left was significantly longer than the rest.
I do not know if this is normal, a ground, or a security measure to
to indicate that the cover has been removed because obvious, you won't
remember where the longer one was located and will put it in at random. :)
Carefully lift the cover straight up and set it aside on a clean surface.
There may be some plumbers' Teflon tape squished between the O-ring and
the flex cable in the rear to improve sealing.  It is probably best to
remove and discard this, replacing it with new tape when the laser is
finally closed permanently after repair (or you give up).
<p>
Power up the system as above and let it ramp up the current while
observing the gap between the laser diode and the fiber combiner for
a deep red glow from each of the 19 emitters of the laser diode array.
There should be an indication of a weak glow at a few amps of current and
the intensity of all 19 emitters should be about equal (except perhaps
just a threshold) and should remain about
equal as the current increases.  Their intensity should increases as well.
<A HREF="hpld19d2.jpg">High Power Laser Diode With Dead Emitters</A> shows
the appearance of a bad array where 2 of the 19 emitters are dark.  The
strange purple color and fuzzy outlines of each spot are due to the
cheap digital camera's inability to properly render the 808 nm.  The
20th spot is probably just spill from the end of the fiber microlens.
<p>
Where there are dead emitters, emitters that are significantly weaker
than their buddies, or emitters that come and go, the entire diode is
suspect.  However, sometimes the remaining emitters will work just fine.
The only way to know for sure is to measure the pump diode output power
with respect to current.
<p>
Since it is highly desirable to avoid removing anything that will require
critical alignment, measuring the pump power can be a bit of a challenge.
Due to the limited space between fiber combiner output and the pump focusing
lens, most suitable power laser power meter probes will not fit.  There are
a couple of options:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Meat thermometer-type power meter:</b> These have a thin susceptor
 slab that may fit into the limited space.  Position *carefully* using
 a "third hand" or some other means so that the sensor is fully exposed
 to the pump beam but not touching anything.  Avoid allowing it to touch
 either the output optic of the fiber combiner or the pump focusing lens.
<p>
 Use the control software to switch between a pump current below pump
 threshold (like 2 A) and test currents from 8 to 20 A.  Monitor how
 far the needle on the meat thermometer moves during the standard time
 (marked on the dial) for each test (e.g., 20 seconds for a typical unit).
<p>
<li><b>Photodiode or thermal laser power meter:</b> Use a microscope cover
 slip to sample of the pump beam.  The reflection at 45 degrees from uncoated
 glass is between 8 and 10 percent, so this can still be substantial power.
 Use a suitable laser power meter (with attenuator if necessary) to measure
 the power.  (Multiply the reading by 10 to get the appoximate true power.)
 However, even this can be tricky as the beam spreads quite quickly and it
 is likely that only a portion will be intercepted by the active sensor area.
 A concave sampler would avoid this problem by reducing the divergence, but
 of course, that's not a common junkbox item. :)
<p>
 CAUTION: DO NOT use a normal aluminized mirror to deflect the beam.
 The loss in a metal coating is high enough that it will likely be
 obliterated if there is any decent power from the pump diode.  I have
 one with a nice hole in the coating from a diode only doing 2 W to prove
 it!  A dielectric mirror coated HR for 808 nm can be used but these aren't
 that common.
</ul>
<p>
Depending on the specific pump diode, the threshold will likely be between
6 and 10 A, and the pump power should increase roughly linearly with pump
current above that.  At 20 A, it should be 10 to 15 WATTs.  If it is lower,
or declines significantly instead of increasing at some point, especially
below 15 A, the pump diode is likely bad.

<h3><A NAME="strmghpdr">Replacement of the Pump Diode in Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A></h3>

For now, this should more correctly be termed "swapping" since I don't know of
a source for the laser diodes with the required fast-axis beam correction, at
least not in small quantities.  However, swapping of a good diode from a
similar laser head appears to work on at least the one (1) unit I tried
and is reasonably straightforward.  This does assume that the laser diode is
absolutely physically identical, especially with
regard to the height of the emitters from its base and, of course, the
emitter spacing.  This may be the case for all diodes used by Melles
Griot for these lasers.  However, diodes from other manufacturers not
intended for Melles Griot lasers may in fact have an emitter spacing
that differs from what is required by just enough to make them totally
incompatible.  The required emitter spacing is very close to 0.5 mm
resulting in a total emitting length of just under 1 cm.
However, it is not known at this time if it is exactly 0.5 mm or a
percent or more greater or less than this.  Measuring the emitter
spacing to the required precision isn't easy and Melles Griot won't
divulge what it is.  If you have a possible candidate diode and it
appears to be suitable, the easiest way to determine if it is indeed
compatible may be to install it and attempt to align it <b>at low
power</b>.  If the spacing is correct, significant power will be
coupled for about half the possible position from side-to-side,
and very little for the other half.  An incompatible diode will
some coupling for most of the range, but no distinct demarkation.
CAUTION: Attempt this ONLY below lasing threshold where there is
just LED emission, or else the back-reflections may damage the
diode and the high power hitting the spaces between fibers may
burn or melt the coupler!  It should be possible to detect enough
LED light coupled through the fibers to get a feel for the amount
of light versus position.  Then, the emitters appear to line up,
increase current to just above lasing threshold to confirm, and then
perform fine alignment as described below.
<p>
WARNING: Depending on type and model, up to 30 watts at 808 nm may be produced
by the pump diode assembly.  For a green laser, a few hundred mW at 1,064 nm
and several W at 532 nm may be present, with the latter two wavelengths
in collimated beams exiting the laser cavity.  For a blue laser,
there may be several hundred mW at 914 nm and 457 nm in collimated beams.
For an IR laser, there may be several watts at 1,064 nm in collimated beams.
Take extreme care.
<p>
CAUTION: The crystals and optics inside the laser cavity are mounted using
some form of optical contacting.  This results in a high quality low loss
interface between optical surfaces, but is not very robust.  In these Melles
Griot lasers, there doesn't even appear to be any additional support like
edge glue.  Therefore, avoid even thinking about going near or touching
the vanadate sandwich (all models) or KTP sandwich (older models).  If any
of these comes apart, there is no practical way of repairing it.
<p>
In addition to common hand tools, the following two items will be required
during laser diode alignment:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A means of driving the laser diode just above threshold.
 The threshold for these diodes is between 4 and 8 amps, with 6 A being
 typical for a 3 W green laser.
<p>
 Only consider using the laser's controller if it can be
 set up to default to a low diode current when powered up.  This is because the
 diode - not to mention your vision - could be damaged if the diode is
 run at full power while being aligned.  Running at reduced current is only
 possible on newer controllers having an RS232 port, or by construction of
 a current bypass circuit as described in the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpal">Adjustment of Laser Diode Current in Melles
 Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A>.  Where the controller allows the current
 to be changed, the initial value must be saved using the password protected
 mode to update the NVRAM so it will default to the lower current when
 powered up.  In either case, the controller must be set to constant
 current mode.
<p>
 If the controller can't be used, a proper
 laser diode driver is lowest risk, but a variable voltage power supply
 with a current limiting resistor can be used if it doesn't do bad things
 like spiking or reversing polarity when power cycled.  I used a simple
 power supply consisting of a transformer, rectifier, small filter
 capacitor, low value parallel resistor used as a fast bleeder, and series
 power resistor for current limiting, with the input to the transformer
 controlled by a Variac.  The output is pulsed DC but the peak is limited
 to be way below anything that might be damaging to the diode.  The pulsed
 DC is actually beneficial because the average power to the diode is quite
 low and cooling is a non-issue.
<p>
 Connections should be changed ONLY when the power supply voltage is 0.  For
 the duration of these tests at the relatively low current with the diode
 on its large metal mounting plate, no active cooling is required even if
 the controller or a constant current driver is used, but don't leave the
 diode powered for more than a few minutes.
<p>
<li>A low power (mW range) continuous reading laser power meter.
 to monitor the laser diode or green output power.
 It doesn't need to be fancy - almost any silicon photodiode and multimeter
 would be more than adequate.  Don't use a thermal power meter as they are
 not really sensitive enough and the response time is too slow.
</ul>
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="mghpgdl1.jpg">Interior of Melles Griot High Power Green
DPSS Laser</A> or <A HREF="mgbld-l2.jpg">Interior of Melles Griot 58-BLD-605
Blue DPSS Laser</A> (as appropriate) while performing the following procedure:
<p>
CAUTION: Laser diodes are very sensitive to everything.  ESD work rules apply!
<p>
<b>Pre-op:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>If the laser diode (LD) current and temperature set-points for the donor and
 recipient controllers are available (via RS232 ports) or can be determined
 (using the approach described in the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpt">Testing the Controllers for Melles Griot
 High Power DPSS Lasers</A>), record these for later use.
<p>
 If the donor LD diode temperature set-point is not known, experimentation
 will be needed to optimize performance once the transplant has been
 completed.
<p>
 If both controllers are available and operational, and are compatible with
 the recipient laser head, using the donor controller may have a slight
 advantage since that will have the LD default current set to a value known
 to be safe for the laser diode, and the correct LD temperature set-point.
 Whether that LD current will produce the same output power when in
 its new home is another matter and may depend on the specific crystals,
 optics, and alignment.  But at least it won't harm the laser diode.
 Then, only the Xtal temperature set-point will need to be modified.
<p>
 Where the controller from the donor laser is not available, the LD
 temperature set-point will have to be modified.  The LD current may
 also be different by a large enough amount to be an issue.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>On newer controllers with an RS232 port, the LD current can be adjusted
  and its value saved as the new current used when powered up (but this
  will not change the factory default which might accidentally get reset).
<p>
 <li>However, on older controllers, the LD current cannot be changed at all.
  A difference of a couple of amps is probably not critical in terms of
  LD health but if too high, reducing it using the approach described in
  the section: <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpal">Adjustment of Laser Diode
  Current in Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A> might be a good idea.
 </ul>
<p>
 Since the only known way of modifying temperature set-points is with a
 circuit to fool the controller into thinking the temperature is not quite
 what it really is, this will have to be added inside the head shell for
 the laser head connector.  More on this below.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Recipient preparation:</b>
<p>
<ol start=2>
<li>Remove the cover on the recipient laser.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>On older laser heads, there are a row of very small hex screws along
  both sides and 4 on the top.
<p>
 <li>On newer laser heads, there are rows of hex cap screws along the sides.
  The cap screws alternate between cover screws and baseplate screws.  Only
  the cover screws need to be removed.  They are recessed slightly less than
  the others.  There are also a pair of flat head Philips screws at the rear
  that need to be removed..
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Remove the two connections to the bad diode.  They are the fat red and
 black wires in the photo but the colors in your laser head may differ.  Take
 care not to lose the screws and washers.
<p>
<li>Remove the four diode mounting screws being careful not to move the diode
 *toward* the fiber coupler in the process.  It is essential that the
 input surface of the fiber coupler not be damaged.  The diode should now
 be free.  If there is an indium pad underneath the diode, take care not to
 damage it and set it aside for the replacement.  If there is silicone heatsink
 compound, carefully remove it with a lint-free cloth and then throw away
 the cloth.  Set the screws aside in a safe place.
<p>
<li>Inspect the input surface of the fiber coupler.  When diodes die due to
 short circuits, stuff vaporizes and will condense on the fiber coupler.
 But, usually, the fast axis fiber lens protects the critical fiber ends.
 Use pure isopropyl alcohol and lens tissue to gently clean the entire
 input surface of the fiber coupler, multiple times if necessary.
<p>
<li>Place the head cover losely in position on the recipient laser to keep out
 dust until ready to install the replacement diode.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Donor organ removal:</b>
<p>
<ol start=7>
<li>Remove the cover on the donor laser as above.
<p>
<li>Taking ESD precautions, remove the connections to the donor diode and
 temporarily install a shorting wire.
<p>
<li>Remove the four diode mounting screws being careful not to move the diode
 *toward* the fiber coupler in the process.  It is essential that the
 diode emitting surface and fast-axis correction lens be undamaged.
 The diode should now be free.  Carefully lift it out and remove the
 indium pad or heatsink compound from its bottom surface.  Set the diode
 aside on an ESD-safe surface.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Laser diode installation and alignment:</b>
<p>
<ol start=10>
<li>Remove the cover of the recipient.  If there was originally an indium pad
 under the old diode, reuse it.  If there was heatsink compound, add a very
 thin new layer.  It is critical to use the same method as was used with the
 old diode because its height might otherwise change by too much to allow for
 the emitters to line up with the fiber coupler input apertures vertically.
<p>
<li>Carefully place the diode in the approximate location but well clear
 of the fiber coupler.  Loosely install the same 4 mounting screws that
 were used on this laser.  They should be at most finger tight to permit
 the diode to be moved by hand during alignment.
<p>
 CAUTION: There are metal washers underneath the heads of the mounting
 screws for the diode.  If it is pushed too far sideways, one of these may
 contact the center bar, shorting out your driver.  Avoid this if possible
 but above all, make sure your driver won't do something bad to the diode
 when the short goes away!
<p>
<li>Remove the shorting wire and attach the two large current connections.
 The positive (+, A1 on the D-sub connector) goes to the side; the negative
 (-, A2 on the D-sub connector) goes to the center bar.  The color coding on
 your laser may be different than the one in the photos!  Don't make any
 assumptions!
<p>
<li>The best place to attach the laser diode driver is at the laser head
 connector.  This will require two of the mating fat female contacts, which
 should be conveniently located in the protective shorting plug that
 comes with these lasers.  Remove the wire loop and solder wires of your
 own to it.  If the contacts or the plug are not available, the driver may
 also be attached directly to the diode, or to the junction point on the
 ribbon cable in newer laser heads.  Use screw connections.  DO NOT use
 clip leads.  If one were to slip while the laser diode is powered, bad
 things *will* happen.  Double check your connections!
<p>
<li>Place a laser power meter either at the output of the fiber coupler/beam
 shaper (before the focusing lens), or at the very output of the laser.
 Note that the latter is easier but the laser power meter will be seeing both
 IR pump light that makes its way through the optics and any green output.
 But this shouldn't be a problem for alignment.
<p>
<li>Slowly increase the current to the laser diode until there is IR being
 emitted and it is just above the lasing threshold.  At first there will
 only be LED emission but most people can see the IR as a deep red glow
 at the output of the diode well enough to detect it easily without
 anything other than Mark-I eyeballs.  The individual emitters should be
 clearly visible.  Above the lasing threshold, the intensity of the glow
 will increase dramatically.  The lasing threshold for these diodes is
 probably around 6 A but possibly anywhere from 4 to 8 A depending on model.
 The intensity of all 19 emitters should be about equal.
 <A HREF="hpld19d2.jpg">High Power Laser Diode With Dead Emitters</A> shows
 the appearance of a bad array where 2 of the 19 emitters are dark.  The
 strange purple color and fuzzy outlines of each spot are due to the
 cheap digital camera's inability to properly render the 808 nm.  The
 20th spot is probably just spill from the end of the fiber microlens.
<p>
<li>VERY CAREFULLY move the diode in the transverse direction (sideways!) to
 locate the positions at which the power making it through the fiber
 coupler/beam shaper is a maximum.  On a healthy green laser head, there
 will be a small amount of green output in addition to the IR for a laser
 diode current not much above threshold.  I don't know what happens
 on a blue laser head since it may be much more finicky about LD and
 Xtal temperature.
<p>
 CAUTION: The fast-axis microlens on the diode should be close - but not quite
 touching - the fiber coupler input surface for best performance.  The
 mounting arrangement may prevent contact but don't count on it.
<p>
 There will be two or more positions where power peaks since the diode
 mounting holes are purposely quite large to allow for adjustment.  Don't
 assume the center one is correct (though it probably is).  The best way
 to know for sure is to use the laser power meter to check the peak output
 for each possibility and pick the largest one.  However, carefully viewing
 the output of the fiber coupler/beam shaper should show all fiber positions
 illuminated when the location is correct.  It's kind of hard to see though.
 And it looks like the set of 19 input apertures on the fiber coupler are
 centered so the red spots from the diode should also be centered even
 if the diode itself is slightly off to one side.
<p>
 Note: I believe that the position of the diode shown in
 <A HREF="mghpgdl1.jpg">Interior of Melles Griot High Power Green
 DPSS Laser</A> may in fact not be correct even though it appears to be
 centered with respect to the fiber coupler.  The washers under the
 diode mounting screws next to the positive terminal appear to be
 too close to the center bar.  This photo was taken by someone who had
 been swapping diodes between two of these lasers.
<p>
<li>Complete the alignment by even more carefully moving the diode in the
 transverse direction to maximize the measured output power.  Double check
 that the diode's microlens is close to but not touching the fiber coupler
 input surface and parallel to it.  Tighten the diode mounting screws in an
 alternating pattern - like an engine cylinder head.  Confirm that the power
 measurement hasn't changed significantly, or possibly has even improved
 since the diode is slightly lower and may be better aligned vertically.
<p>
<li>Power down the laser diode, make sure the power supply is at 0 V, and
 remove the temporary connections.
<p>
<li>Replace the cover and secure it loosely until success has been confirmed.
 Make sure no wires are being squashed by the cover.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Initial testing:</b>
<p>
<ol start=20>
<li>Connect the desired controller to the laser head and power it up.
 Be prepared to hit the "Off" button if anything unexpected happens.  Assuming
 your replacement diode is healthy and was installed correctly, and the
 recipient laser head is otherwise in good condition, there should be
 some green or blue (as appropriate!) output after 10 to 30 seconds. 
 Since one of the temperature set-points is not correct, even if everything
 else is perfect, the output power may be substantially lower than expected.
 Don't panic.  Even a relatively small error can result in significant
 output power variation.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Modifying the temperature set-point:</b>
<p>
<ol start=21>
<li>Determine which temperature set-point is in error based on the controller
 being used.  Then see the section:
 <A HREF="laserstr.htm#strmghpat">Adjustment of Temperature Set-Points in
 Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A> to construct a suitable fakeout
 widget.  Since the exact set-point resistance should be known, it will
 be simple to calculate the proper resistance values to be used so not
 much adjustment should be needed.  With only one resistor and a trimpot,
 the circuit can with some care, be fitted inside the head shell for the
 laser head power connector.
<p>
<li>Adjust the trimpot very slowly slightly in each direction to locate
 the best setting.  Wait 30 seconds or so for the laser to stabilize
 at each setting.
<p>
<li>Button everything up and you're done!
</ol>
<p>

<h3><A NAME="strmghpdt">Repairing a Melles Griot 58-GSD-309</A></h3>

This laser originally had a totally shorted laser diode.  Not only did it
test as a dead short, but there was a very visible burn mark on the emitting
area.  However, I had a sample of the same model laser with a good laser
diode but no laser cavity or optics.  Although this laser was several years
older than the "patient", the diodes appeared by eye at least, to be identical.
<p>
Please refer to <A HREF="mghpgdl1.jpg">Interior of Melles Griot High Power
Green DPSS Laser</A>.  While this photo is not of quite the same model,
there are no obvious physical differences that I could find.
<p>
At first I was going to swap the entire platform on which the laser diode and
fiber coupler/beam shaper are mounted.  The benefit would be that the laser
diode would already be perfectly aligned with the fiber coupler.
But only after removing the platform with the bad diode from the patient and
removing the platform with the good diode from the donor, did I discover
that the size of the platforms was not quite identical and the bracket to
which the ribbon cables are attached on the patient laser prevented easy
installation.  I could still have done it this way by removing
the bracket or maybe just bending part of it out of the way on both sides,
but then decided that the alignment of the output of the fiber coupler/beam
shaper might be more of an alignment nightmare than alignment of the laser
diode since its output was less likely to be the same in the vertical
direction for both lasers.  Unfortunately, having already removed the
platform from the patient laser, alignment of that would be required also.
Oh well.
<p>
On to plan B.
<p>
I used the procedure described in the previous section to replace the diode.
Well, actually, that procedure was developed based on this transplant. :)
<p>
With just the initial alignment using my brute force laser diode driver,
the laser immediately produced just over 2.0 watts with its controller.
Although the beams were circular, there was a lot of scatter which I traced
to the output surface of the output coupler mirror.  I don't think I put a
fingerprint on it but that's the most likely cause. :)
Cleaning that resulted two very nice clean beams with minimal scatter and
a bit more power.
<p>
Then I had a realization that perhaps the fiber coupler was off by one
aperture and went back and redid that alignment more carefully.  The
diode mounting holes in these lasers are drilled a slightly offset from
the centerline resulting in the diode wanting to be shifted sideways
by a fraction of a millimeter and that seems to be the best location.
I'm not really sure but I believe it was originally correct.  However,
after that, the output power did improve to about 2.2 W so either
the final position did use one additional aperture, or more likely,
the alignment was a bit better..
<p>
Then I carefully adjusted the side-to-side alignment of the laser diode
mounting platform.  That improved the output power to about 2.3 W.
<p>
Next, it was time to deal with the temperature set-points.  I assumed that
since a replacement laser diode was installed, it would require a different
set-point.  And, based on the controller that I assumed went with the donor
laser, I thought that the laser diode temperature would need to be slightly
higher.  So, I added a 5K ohm rheostat in series with the LD thermistor
and set about attempting to peak output power.  While it was obvious the
adjustment was changing the temperature, there was no dramatic effect and
at most, output power only increased to about 2.4 W.
<p>
I really didn't think that modifying the Xtal temperature would be needed
since the laser cavity was original, but on a whim, I added a rheostat to
its thermistor.  Now THAT had a dramatic effect, finally bringing the
output power up to almost 3 watts!
<p>
And since, the LD adjustment seemed to be at the 0 ohms end of its range,
I replaced the rheostat with a complete fakeout circuit as described in the
section: <A NAME="laserstr.htm#strmghpat">Adjustment of Temperature Set-Points
in Melles Griot High Power DPSS Lasers</A>.  The circuit had R1=5K and R2=51K
for a nominal set-point of 10K ohms.  The result was another 0.1 W or so.
Although the actual output power on these lasers when in constant current
mode may vary by 5 percent or so from one power cycle to the next based on how
the modes just happen to fit under the gain curve, this unit will now
consistently achieve 2.9 W and sometimes over 3 W if it feels like it.
Since I don't believe in coincidences, being so near 3 W suggests that it's
running close to the way it was set up originally.  Not a bad percentage
improvement from 0.0 W! :) And the diode current is probably still 10 A
below the rated operating current of the diode itself.
<p>
I now suspect that the controller that came with this laser was not the
controller that was supposed to go with it.  The Xtal temperature should
not have had to change dramatically and LD the temperature should have, based
on the set-points of the controllers for both lasers that I have.  However,
it was just about the opposite - the LD set-point was almost unchanged while
the Xtal set-point changed by about 2K ohms.  And, yes, I've doublechecked
that the resistances I had to add are wired to the correct thermistors.
I'm not sure how forthcoming Melles Griot will be with information on
the matchup based on serial numbers.

<h2>Tid-Bits from Laser Mainenance Land</h2>
<h3><A NAME="strtid0">When You're in Continuous Panic Mode</A></h3>

(From: Bob.)
<p>
I remember a story from a friend of mine in the laser show biz.  They bought an
old medical doubled YAG laser, chopped it down and put the optics in a head
enclosure, the power supply in a cabinet, then put everything in road cases.
It sounded like the neatest little green YAG at the time. Well, they were
setting up for a show in a large convention hall for some corporate big wigs
(GM, Boeing, something like that).  They needed the power of a YAG because the
customer wanted the laser to be seen without the room lights turned off.
The day before the show during set up they fired up the laser and they were
only getting a hand-full of mW out, and very unstable at that.  Apparently,
something had bumped the KTP mount in transit and when they first turned the
laser on, the intracavity light hit the side of  the crystal shattering it.
So they had a replacement Fedexed to them for next day delivery.  After delays
with Fedex, they finally got the crystal like 45 minutes before the laser was
needed.  This was already DURING the time of the performance, seminar,
whatever, was was going on. So I was on the phone with this guy, for the
whole time, as they had never fully aligned a KTP before.  The heated
conversation went like: Me: OK, check IR power then realign the back optic,
then tweak the KTP for max green.  Him: !@$# only 3 W and we're on in 10
minutes! I don't know what it is about laser light shows that seem to bring
out the largest assortment of Murphy's laws.  But they sure do! If you're
going pro, you'll have stories of aligning optics in the field and the like
for us, sure enough. :)

<p>
I'd say I probably am (an) expert on making the laserscope laser lase at full
power given no replacement parts and no time to get it done.  :)  I've done
shows at full power using cracked KTP by realigning the crystal and ringing
through the largest chunk that was left.  I've overdriven and chipped the
Q-switch quartz, and fixed it in the field by flipping the crystal upside down
(luckily the beam doesn't go dead center but a few mm off to one side).  I've
burned tuned dielectrics and realigned off to the side to "get her going for
the show".  I've cracked mirrors....  OK, enough said about the trials and
tribulations of this business. :)
