<h2>Basic Home-Built HeHg Laser Information</h2>
<h3><A NAME="chgchg0">Introduction to Home-Built HeHg Laser</A></h3>

The Helium-Mercury (HeHg) laser is similar in many respects to the HeNe and
Ar/Kr ion lasers in terms of operation.  Another name for this laser is the
"Mercury Vapor Ion Laser" since it operates on ion transitions of mercury
(and this is what it is called in the Scientific American article).  It can
generate intense pulses of light in the green (567 nm) and less intense pulses
in the red-orange (615 nm) portion of the visible spectrum.  Output power
for a 100 cm tube (similar to what's described below) may exceed 20 mW.
<p>
It may be somewhat easier (everything is relative!) to construct than those
other lasers in terms of the required chemical/gas supplies (only a drop of
mercury and helium) and ease of mirror alignment (since it uses a wide-bore
tube).  However, a medium vacuum system and some glass work will still be
needed.
<p>
Another Helium-Metal-Vapor laser is the Helium-Cadmium (HeCd)
laser which is available commercially and operates in the blue (442 nm) and
near-UV (325 nm) wavelengths.  See the chapter:
<A HREF="laserhec.htm#hectoc">Helium-Cadmium Lasers</A> for more info.
<p>
And yet another, the Helium-Selenium (HeSe) laser, can generate wavelengths
all the way from red to UV depending on the mirrors used.  While I don't know
of commercial versions of this laser, it appears to be an interesting
candidate for a home-built laser once you master the HeHg laser.  See the
sections: <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgcse1">Mark's Helium-Selenium (HeSe)
Laser</A> and <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgchg9">Discussion of Other
Helium-Metal-Vapor Lasers</A>.
<p>
WARNING: Mercury, selenium, and cadmium are ALL classified as toxic heavy
metals though I don't know which kills you the fastest.  Once a laser tube is
sealed off, there is no danger unless it breaks.  However, safe handling
procedures must be followed for toxic heavy metals when dealing with the
initial filling of the laser tube and disposal of any excess material.
Where the laser tube is not sealed gaseous and liquid mercury, or gaseous
cadmium or selenium (depending on what you are using) may be sucked up by the
vacuum system so a trap must be provided on its inlet port.

<h3><A NAME="chgsaf">Home-Built HeHg Laser Safety</A></h3>

There are three areas of safety considerations for the home-built HeHg laser
(and other similar lasers, for that matter):
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Laser output:</b> The home-built HeHg laser may be capable of producing
 a beam with an average power of several 10s of mW at multiple wavelengths.
 Since there doesn't seem to be any hard information on the actual power
 obtainable with this or similar home-built laser designs, it is important to
 take precautions assuming a higher power until determined otherwise.
<p>
 Avoid eye contact with the direct or reflected beam.  This includes the 4
 pairs of beams reflecting off the Brewster windows which may be quite strong.
<p>
<li><b>Electrical:</b> The power supplies can be lethal.  Neon sign transformer
 based power supplies have enough voltage and current to stop a heart,  Even
 if you aren't killed, the shock may startle you into doing something you might
 regret.  Make sure you read and follow the <A HREF="safety.htm">Safety
 Guidelines for High Voltage and/or Line Powered Equipment</A>.  Insulate all
 connections and install barriers to prevent contact with the high voltage.
<p>
<li><b>Chemicals:</b> Mercury (Hg) is a toxic heavy metal.  While not much is
 really used in a laser, metallic Hg and its compounds will get on all the
 interior surfaces of your laser tube, gas manifold, and up to or past the
 filter in your vacuum system.  Hg combines (forms an amalgom) with many common
 metals like copper, gold, and silver just as in dental fillings (Hg + powdered
 silver).  Thus, any of these materials in your system will be contaminated
 after awhile as well.  Make sure you have adequate ventilation to prevent a
 build-up of mercury vapor either from metallic Hg or through the vacuum system
 exhaust.  Take appropriate precautions in use and dispose of these hazardous
 materials in a responsible way.
<p>
 More information on the hazards of mercury and other heavy metals can be
 found from the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  One source
 is the <A HREF=http://msds.ehs.cornell.edu/msdssrch.asp">Cornell
 Material Safety Data Sheets Page</A>.
</ul> 
<p>
Provide proper warning signs for both the laser radiation and high voltage.
Keep pets and small children out of the area and make sure everyone present is
instructed as to the dangers.  The use of proper laser safety goggles for the
specific wavelength(s) of your laser are highly recommended.
<p>
For more information, see the chapter: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saftoc">Laser
Safety</A>.  Sample safety labels which can be edited for this laser can be
found in the section: <A HREF="lasersaf.htm#saflslbl">Laser Safety Labels
and Signs</A>.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg1">HeHg Laser Construction References and Links</A></h3>

I am not aware of any on-line information relating to any of the other types of
home-built Helium-Metal-Vapor lasers.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg3">Home-Built HeHg Laser Description</A></h3>

The HeHg laser is similar in basic structure to the HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers
but is in some ways easier to construct, align, and operate.
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="hehg1asm.gif">Typical Home-Built Helium-Mercury Laser
Assembly</A> for a simplified diagram of the overall glasswork and power supply
electronics.
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall - M.
  <li>Glass work - M.
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work) - M.
  <li>Vacuum/gas handling - M.
  <li>Additional apparatus (optical mirror alignment jig) - M.
  <li>Power supply - M.
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - 567 nm (green) and 615 nm (red-orange).
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium - Low pressure He and Hg vapor.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter - 13 mm; bore length - 107 cm.
<p>
  <li>Total tube length (includes additional space beyond the actual bore,
    e.g., to the center of the Brewster windows) - 122 cm.
<p>
  <li>Tube material - Borosilicate (Pyrex) glass except for the Brewster windows
    which are fused quartz.  Soda-lime glass parts could also be used for the
    tube (since it doesn't run particularly hot) to ease the glass working
    requirements (no oxygen fed torch required) but take care if you are
    interested in boosting power by playing with the power supply ratings!
<p>
  <li>Electrodes - Cold cathode type using coated neon sign electrodes.  These
    are mounted in side-side-arms.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill - helium and mercury vapor (from a drop of mercury contained in
    a central side/bottom tube) at a .5 to 1 Torr.  Your hand or small heater
    used to control vapor pressure of mercury.
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Convection air.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Quartz windows, Brewster angle = 34.43 degrees from axis for
    567.7 nm.  Since this is a multi-wavelength laser like the Ar/Kr ion type,
    mounting these on ball-and-socket joints might result in slightly better
    performance for any given line but the improvement would probably very
    slight.
<p>
  <li>Mirrors - Dielectric, concave, RoC = 147 cm; Reflectivity of 99.5 percent
    at 567.7 nm.  (It appears from the SciAm article whether both mirrors
    (normally called the HR and OC) had the same reflectivity, in which case,
    equal intensity beams would be emitted from each end of the laser.)
    Three screw <A HREF="mmount1.gif">Adjustable Mirror Mount</A>
    at each end.  Alignment can use any of the techniques from this document
    or "Light and its Uses".
<p>
  <li>Total resonator length (mirror face to mirror face) - 140 cm.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Requirements - medium.  Article calls shows diffusion pump but suggests
    that this isn't really needed.  However, the tube must be pumped down to
    well under 0.1 Torr and then backfilled to operate at about 0.5 Torr.
<p>
  <li>Sealed tube operation but temperature of mercury reservoir must be
    adjusted to control vapor pressure and connection to vacuum system is
    needed.  See the section <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgchg6">HeHg Laser Sealed
    Tube Operation?</A>.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required - small quantity of liquid mercury.
  CAUTION: Fumes and compounds of mercury are poisonous.
<p>
<li>Excitation/Pumping:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - electrical discharge.
<p>
  <li>Power supply - 9,000 VRMS, 20 mA neon sign transformer and Variac with
    bridge rectifier and 10 nF (.01 uF), 15 kV capacitor.

<h3><A NAME="chgguide">Guidelines to Assure a Successful Home-Built HeHg
 Laser</A></h3>

These set of guidelines should be followed during construction of your first
home-built HeHg laser.  The factors below will greatly influence the ultimate
output power, beam quality, and whether it produces any coherent light at all!
Once you have a working laser, feel free to make modifications - one at a time.
Thanks to George Werner (glwerner@sprynet.com) for his comments.

<ul>
<li>Obtain good quality fused quartz optical flats for the Brewster windows.
 They should be at least 1 mm thick to minimize distortion from the vacuum
 These don't have to be expensive - plenty of low cost surplus optics is
 available.  While some glass microscope slides <i>might</i> work, there is no
 real way to be sure before your entire laser is assembled and then it is too
 late to change.  Any candidate Brewster window should pass the following
 tests:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>When viewed edgewise, it must <b>NOT</b> have a greenish (or other
  color) tint.
 <p>
 <li>When you hold it at arm's length and view something across the room
  through it, there should be no detectable magnification or minification.
 <p>
 <li>When viewed against a black background in a concentrated light beam (such
  as sunlight passing through an f/4 concentrating lens) it should show very
  little scattering of light (from incomplete cleaning or incomplete
  polishing).
 </ol>
<p>
 No other aspect of the laser tube assembly itself is as important as the
 quality of the Brewster windows to the ultimate outcome of this project!
 While, certain types of distortion won't prevent lasing (some may even make
 it more exciting with complex mode structures), this is a complicating
 factor your first laser can do without.
<p>
<li>Cut the ends of the laser tube to accept the Brewster windows only
 <i>>after</i> all glass working (including annealing) has been performed as
 these steps may affect the angles enough to increase losses.  Take care that
 the angle is close to the correct value for your window material (34.4
 degrees from the beam axis for fused quartz) with their perpendiculars as
 close to parallel as possible.  (An error of up to 1/2 degree is acceptable
 in both cases.  The ball-and-socket approach of the SciAm pulsed Ar/Kr ion
 laser can be used instead to provide some adjustment range but this really
 isn't needed.)  Use the /===\ arrangement, <b>not</b> /===/ (which will
 shift the optical axis).   Make sure the inside surfaces of the windows are
 immaculately clean before installation!  They can't really be cleaned
 properly once attached to the tube.
<p>
<li>Mount the electrodes in side-arms well away from and with no line-of-sight
 to the Brewster windows.  This will minimize the deposit of a metallic film
 on the Brewster windows due to sputtering (particularly at the negative
 electrode).
<p>
<li>Don't skip the essential cleaning step before final assembly of the
 Brewster windows to the laser tube.  This will greatly reduce the amount of
 bake-out required once you are under vacuum.  It will still be necessary to
 pass a high current through the tube in both directions for some time as
 well as running a low temperature torch over areas that aren't heated enough
 by the discharge.  However, the amount of outgassing and required time will
 be greatly reduced.
<p>
 CAUTION: Apparently, it is possible for an electron beam to be produced from
 the positive electrode during the high current bake-out step which can quickly
 melt a hole through the tube wall opposite the side-arm if left running for
 more than a few seconds.  The visual effect will first be a spot of bright
 yellow sodium light from the point of impact.  Use lower current and/or make
 that area of the tube (the outside of the turn) much thicker.
<p>
<li>Obtain proper laser resonator mirrors.  Sorry, you can't make these in
 your basement.  Don't even bother to try silvered or aluminized mirrors
 (e.g., from barcode scanners), at least not until you have the laser working
 with real mirrors.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>The HR should have as high a reflectivity as possible and the OC should
  have about 99 percent reflectivity (assuming the 107 cm active bore length),
  both at the green 567.7 nm line, and similar reflectivities at the
  red-orange 615 nm line (if desired).  If your laser is longer, the OC
  reflectivity can be reduced slightly but starting with 99 percent will work
  well, if not being quite optimal.  Or, if you would like to have beams from
  both ends or identical mirrors are much cheaper, they can both be 99.5
  percent.  For initial testing, the use of a pair of HR mirrors will result
  in the lowest threshold and the highest likelihood of lasing if something
  else is marginal.  Once you see the (coherent) light, a proper OC can be
  installed.
<p>
 <li>Their Radius of Curvature (RoC) should be between L and 2*L, where L is
  the distance between mirrors.  An RoC of L will result in a confocal cavity
  which has a number of attributes including being relatively easy to align.
  An alternative which may be desirable is to implement a folded confocal
  cavity with an RoC of 2*L for the HR and infinity (planar) for the OC.
  See the sections: <A HREF="laserioi.htm#ioimir">Mirrors used for Lasers
  and Laser Applications</A> and <A HREF="laserclp.htm#clpcao3">Mirrors for
  Home-Built Lasers</A> for more info.
<p>
 <li>Mirrors salvaged from commercial HeNe laser tubes or other lasers may be
  satisfactory if their RoC and reflectivities are as described above.
  However, since the wavelengths of the HeHg laser do not coincide with those
  of other common lasers, the reflectivities any candidate mirrors would have
  to be tested.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Mount everything on a stable base and make sure your mirror mounts have
 adequate precision!  No amount of fiddling will compensate for mirrors that
 change position on their own.  Yes, it may be possible to assemble a working
 laser mounted on wobbly stands but this isn't recommended!
<p>
<li>Use a HeNe or collimated diode laser to perform the mirror alignment.
 Mount the alignment laser to the baseplate so that it will be there whenever
 you need it.  Do the initial alignment once everything is assembled but
 <i>before</i> actually evacuating the system and filling it with the helium
 and mercury vapor.  Then, you'll be ready to lase, or at least very close.
 Other alignment methods can also be used with this wide bore laser.
<p>
<li>Use spectroscopic grade helium for the buffer gas.  Party balloon helium
 may work but there is no way to know the type and percentage of impurities
 it may have.
<p>
<li>Make sure you read, understand, and follow <b>ALL</b> the safety
 guidelines found in the section: <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgsaf">Home-Built
 HeHg Laser Safety</A>.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="chgspps">Sources of Special Parts and Supplies for the Home-Built
 HeHg Laser</A></h3>

Beyond the normal glass work, vacuum system, and helium, a small amount of
metallic mercury will be required.
<p>
WARNING: Mercury is considered a toxic heavy metal so appropriate precautions
should be taken in its handling and disposal.  Vapors are poisonous and can
build up in a confined space.  Mercury combines readily with many substances
resulting in hazardous compounds.  See the section:
<A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgsaf">Home-Built HeHg Laser Safety</A>.
<p>
You could try a chemical supply house but there are lower cost alternatives
to buying a kilogram of mercury (assuming they will even sell it to you) when
all that is needed are a couple of grams at most.
<p>
Your local friendly dentist has plenty - that's what he mixes with silver to
make those wonderful amalgam fillings you love to have installed.  What a
great excuse for a checkup!  If you can convince him/her that you know what
you are doing and provide a suitable container, it should be a simple matter
to donate a couple drops to a good cause.
<p>
Don't want to go near dentists?  I don't blame you!
<p>
OK, you probably have one or more silent switches in your house or apartment.
These are the kind with absolutely no detents or snap action whatsoever.  They
are most likely mercury switches.  Find an excuse to change one. "Ma, there
are sparks, smoke, and 10 foot flames coming out of the wall..... I think
this switch is bad". ;-)  Inside a mercury switch will be one or more
metal/ceramic capsules - they sort of look like tall flying saucers and can be
cracked open in a vice (make sure you do it in something to catch the
mercury!).  There is ample mercury in a single one of these for any reasonable
HeHg or similar laser or mercury vapor discharge experiments.
<p>
Of course, tilt switches out of thermostats, water level sensors in sump
pumps, and similar devices may have even more mercury.  Since they are
usually made of glass, getting at it will be somewhat easier.  But don't take
them from where they will be missed: "Tommy, it's roasting in here and why
is the basement flooded?". :)
<p>
Note: Fluorescent and high intensity discharge lamps also contain a drop of
metallic mercury but it isn't worth the trouble to get at it.  And, smashing
these light bulbs may release other toxic substances!  With the pressure to
prevent environmental contamination, only very small quantities of mercury
are used in modern lamps (maybe a few milligrams for a 4 foot tube).  Thus,
not recommended.

This is very similar to the HeHg laser described above.  However, it is about
twice as large and therefore capable of higher power operation.  (This design
appears to be similar to a HeHg laser described in: "Gas Laser Technology",
Sinclair and Bell, ISBN 03-075385-6).  It may be able to generate up to
several watts on the red-orange line (615 nm) and green line (567 nm).  Also

<h3><A NAME="chgchgs">Status of Chris's HeHg Laser</A></h3>

(From: Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com).)
<p>
I am just about to finally complete a mercury vapor laser as per the SciAm
plans. All that I have left to do is polish flat the brewster angle cuts at
either end of the plasma tube so my quartz windows will fit snugly. I am
looking forward to many hours of exciting experimentation with this rare type
of laser. I will get some pictures of the completed system to you as soon as I
can.

<h3><A NAME="chgmse1">Mark's Helium-Selenium (HeSe) Laser</A></h3>

The HeSe laser is similar in basic structure to the HeHg laser in that it
consists of a gas discharge tube along with a means of heating selenium pellets
to control their vapor pressure.  Unlike the HeHg laser, the HeSe laser (at
least this example) uses a narrow bore tube more like that of the HeNe or
Ar/Kr ion laser.  In many ways, it is similar to these to construct, align,
and operate.  More information (including more on this particular design) is
available in the section: <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgchg9">Discussion of Other
Helium-Metal-Vapor Lasers</A>.
<p>
A Helium-Cadmium (HeCd) laser could probably be built using the same basic
design as the Hese laser given below.
<p>
This HeSe laser was built by Mark Dinsmore (dinsmore@ma.ultranet.com).)
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="hese1asm.gif">Mark's Home-Built Helium-Selenium Laser
Tube</A> for a simplified diagram of the overall glasswork and electrode
structure.
<ul>
<li>Level of difficulty (rated L=low, M=medium, H=high):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall - H.
  <li>Glass work - H. (A little more difficult than a HeNe laser from scratch.)
  <li>Fabrication (other than glass work) - M.
  <li>Vacuum/gas handling - M.
  <li>Power supply - M.
  <li>Additional apparatus (optics, alignment jig, etc.) - M.
  <li>Risks (high voltage, toxic chemicals, etc.) - M.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Lasing wavelength(s) - Depending on optics, up to 24 wavelengths between
 red and UV!  With blue-green (not single line) argon optics, several
 wavelengths from 540 nm to 460 nm.  <A HREF="hese1wl.jpg">Helium-Selenium
 Laser Wavelengths Using Argon Ion Optics</A> shows at least 8 lines and
 enough power for the beams to be visible.
<p>
<li>Resonator:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type/lasing medium: Low pressure He and Se vapor. He at around 10 Torr,
    Se heated until the discharge turns white.
<p>
  <li>Bore diameter - 1 mm; bore length - 80 cm.
<p>
  <li>Total tube length - 100 cm
<p>
  <li>Tube material - Borosilicate (Pyrex) glass.
<p>
  <li>Electrodes - Cold cathode type using 200 mA coated neon sign electrodes
    in Pyrex side-arms.
<p>
  <li>Gas fill - Helium with selenium vapor from pellets heated by heat tape
      wrapped around side-arm. Temperature is controlled by a simple analog
      temperature controller.  Selenium at 270 &deg;C - OK for borosilicate
      glass.
<p>
  <li>Cooling - Air cooled.  The discharge current has to be high enough
      that the bore temperature is greater than 270 &deg;C or the Se will
      condense in the bore.  This works out to a minimum current of about
      100 mA.
<p>
  <li>Coupling - Brewster windows.
<p>
 <li>Mirrors - Hemispherical configuration.  The source was a large frame ion
      laser. 5% transmission for the OC.
 <p>
  <li>Total resonator length - 120 cm.
<p>
<li>Vacuum system:
<p>
  <li>Requirements - Medium using two stage mechanical pump and diffusion
    pump.  I don't know if the diffusion pump was really necessary.  Probably
    repeated evacuation and backfill with He using just the mechanical pump
    (good for 10<sup>-5</sup> Torr) would have sufficed.
<p>
    In addition to a vacuum gauge, there should be at least one trap between
    the pump(s) and the laser tube to prevent any mercury from contaminating
    the vacuum system and/or escaping to the atmosphere.  The exhaust from the
    mechanical pump should be passed through another trap if possible before
    being vented <b>outside</b> and away from open windows.
<p>
  <li>Sealed tube operation.  I has been sealed now for over 8 years and still
    works!  I put in a Barium ring getter to keep it clean.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Special chemicals/supplies required (other than gases) - Selenium pellets.
<p>
<li>Excitation:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Type - Electrical discharge.
<p>
  <li>Power supply - Approximately 4 kV at more than 150 mA from rectified
   "Copier" transformer on Variac.  I used a 4 kV, 250 mA transformer surplus
   from <A HREF="http://www.herbach.com/">Herbach and Rademan</A>.  I even
   think that they still have a supply of them after all these years!  The
   catalog says it came out of a copier of some sort.  Verrrrry Dangerous!!!!
   Perfect voltage and current to kill you.  That's the only part of this
   system that scares me.  I run it with one hand in my pocket!

   An Oudin coil (tesla coil type vacuum tester) is used to start the
   discharge eliminating the need for a much higher voltage transformer or
   separate starting circuit.  A pair of power ballast resistors distributes
   the current in approximately the ratio 10:1 between the main anode and the
   anti-cataphoresis electrode.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg5">Estimating HeHg Laser Power</A></h3>

I have a hard enough time estimating power output from a conventional
optimized HeNe laser let alone something like this with so many variables
including: discharge length, bore diameter, Brewster window losses, mirror
reflectivity, gas fill, current peak magnitude and wave shape, etc.  All other
factors being equal without (and without limiting effects), a rough estimate
might suggest that output power is proportional to the volume of the lasing
discharge and peak current - but I don't even know how valid that is!  I think
the gain of the HeHg laser is high enough that a wide variety of tube lengths
and diameters will work with the recommended mirrors (99.5% reflectivity at
567 nm, confocal or concave/planar) but I cannot begin to estimate power.
<p>
I gather from the "Light and its Uses" HeHg laser description that while
the laser produced 'intense pulses of green and red light', the average output
power  wasn't more than a mW or so.  Even a 1 mW of 567 nm green would appear
quite intense - 4 or 5 times brighter than 1 mW of 632.8 red.
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgchg8">Comments on HeHg
Lasers</A>.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg6">HeHg Laser Sealed Tube Operation?</A></h3>

Although in principle, the HeHg laser can be operated in 'sealed tube' fashion,
as a practical matter, maintaining a connection to the vacuum system will be
essential.  The main reason is that once mercury vapor condenses on parts of
the tube away from the side/bottom tube with the mercury drop, you have lost
control of the vapor pressure (since the whole tube cannot be cooled/warmed
as required).  Thus, the need to be able to pump it down if the pressure rises
too high and then supply fresh helium.  So, it may be possible to run the HeHg
laser with the valve to the vacuum system closed, the valve will still have to
be present!
<p>
However, a tube full of mercury vapor at a couple of Torr is not much material
so a drop of mercury should go a long way.  In addition to losses out the
vacuum system and by condensation on the tube walls, some may form an amalgom
with the metal of the electrodes or their lead-in wires (depending on the
metals involved), be adsorbed by the tube walls or Epoxy seals (if used), or
be buried under sputtered electrode material.
<p>
Also see the section: <A HREF="laserchg.htm#chgchg8">Comments on HeHg
Lasers</A>.

<h3><A NAME="chghene">Using a HeNe Laser Tube in a Home-Built HeHg
 Laser?</A></h3>

The following was prompted by the suggestion on the
<A HREF="http://www.plans-kits.com/">Plans and Kits Unlimited Web Site</A>
that it is possible to use a helium-neon (HeNe) laser tube as the basis for a
home-built HeHg laser.  (PKU is not out of business and by the time you read
this, their Web site may be gone as well.)  (They, of course, would have sold
you the plans and also had some HeNe laser heads that would contain suitable
tubes.  Please see the comments on this company and a link to some of their
laser offerings in the section: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpsnsw6">Electronic,
Optics, and Laser Project Plans, Parts, Kits, Specialized Components</A>.)  At
first, the idea of this conversion may seem preposterous but upon reflection
(no pun), perhaps it isn't quite <i>that</i> way out.  However, I am not
claiming that it what is proposed below will actually work.  (Note that I have
NOT seen their plans or even a 4th hand description of them.  Similarities, if
any in the following are entirely coincidental.)
<p>
Refer to <A HREF="hehg2asm.gif">Home-Built Pulsed HeHg Laser Using HeNe Laser
Tube</A> for a simplified diagram of a possible system.
<p>
The idea would be to take a long certifiably dead but undamaged HeNe tube,
break the seal, add a drop of mercury, and attach it to your vacuum/gas supply
system.  I would recommend a tube of at 18" to 24" in length to provide enough
gain to have a chance of lasing.  The mirrors on a red (632.8 nm) HeNe tube
should work for to the 615 nm HeHg wavelength; the mirrors on a green
(543.5 nm) HeNe tube could work for the 567 nm HeHg wavelength.  In both cases,
the mirror reflectivity will be quite close to the value at their design
wavelengths.  I don't know how the narrow bore of the HeNe tube will affect
gain - usually a narrow bore has higher gain than a wide bore.  The optimal
gas pressure and fill ratio (He to vapor pressure of Hg) will also likely be
considerable different for this shorter and narrow bore tube.
<p>
Actually, adding a gas inlet port at the opposite end from the exhaust tube
(probably the anode-end and the exhaust is usually done at the cathode-end),
would be better than just injecting a glob of mercury.  To do this would
require drilling a tiny hole in the side of the mirror mount and installing
a thin piece of tubing to connect to your helium supply and mercury reservoir.
The advantage would be in being able to better control the temperature of the
mercury and thus it vapor pressure.  Vacuum requirements are also less
stringent with a flowing gas system.  However, since the high voltage will
then connect to the same place as the gas/mercury feed, some means will have
to be provided to prevent the discharge from taking place via the this route
(e.g., a long thin plastic capillary).  And, of course, everything there will
be floating at a high voltage!  CAUTION: If you are using what was once a
polarized HeNe tube, there will be a Brewster plate inside at (usually) the
HR-end which might be damaged.  Also, drilling may leave metal particles
and/or a raised ridge that could be difficult to remove.
<p>
In addition to a vacuum gauge, there should be at least one trap between
the pump and the HeNe tube to prevent mercury from contaminating the
vacuum system and/or escaping to the atmosphere.  The exhaust from the
pump should be passed through another trap if possible before being vented
<b>outside</b> and away from open windows.
<p>
One of the concerns with respect to tube life would be possible condensation
of metallic mercury on the mirrors.  However, some (low temperature) heating
tape wrapped around each one would probably provide adequate protection given
the low vaporization temperature of mercury.
<p>
Another problem with using an existing HeNe (or any other type) laser tube is
that the metallurgy will not have been selected with mercury in mind.  Mercury
will combine (amalgamate) with many metals including of course silver
(remember all those wonderful fillings?!) and copper.  What implications this
has for the life of a home-built HeHg laser, I do not know.  Since only small
quantities of Hg will be will be introduced to the tube in the form of a low
pressure vapor, this may not be a serious short term problem at least.  I did
some simple tests with a drop of mercury and the metal of a HeNe tube without
any obvious effects but didn't let it soak for very long!
<p>
A power supply similar to the basic neon sign transformer/rectifier/HV
capacitor specified for the SciAm home-built HeHg laser should work here as
well, though some 'adjustments' may be needed for the narrow bore tube since
the breakdown voltage is likely to be much higher than even for the much
longer, but wide bore SciAm design.
<p>
Whether this will even work - or for how long - I cannot say at present.
However, it's something to try without risking a lot of time or money.  The
cost of intact, but very likely unusable tubes (as HeNe lasers) should be
modest or free: <A HREF="laserlps.htm#lpstoc">Laser and Parts Sources</A>.
The optics are internal and probably aligned correctly (though this should be
confirmed) so much of the difficult work and cost is gone.  If anyone attempts
or succeeds at an endeavor such as this, please send me mail via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A> and I will add your experiences to the collective
knowledge base on the home-built HeHg laser!
<p>
CAUTION: If you have any fantasies or desire to resurrect the original HeNe
tube as a HeNe tube, DO NOT attempt this lunacy as there will be no practical
way of purging it of mercury contamination after you are done playing.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg7">Discussion of Potential Problems in Constructing HeHg
 Laser</A></h3>

(From: Richard Alexander (RAlexan290@gnn.com).)
<p>
Just off the top of my head, I'd say the problem with it is the 
mercury. That is toxic stuff, and it goes right through your skin. 
Make it a vapor and you would breath it. The less you fool with it, 
the better off you are. 
<p>
Another problem might be that mercury is expensive. A pint jar of 
mercury would be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars (well, a 
lot, anyway). The same amount of copper would be worth only a few dollars. 
<p>
(From: David Demmer (ddemmer@physics.utoronto.ca).)
<p>
Nah, in an earlier life I was a chemist, and demonstrated a physical 
chemistry lab that used a Toppler pump. For the uninitiated, this 
consists of some ingenious glassware and about 500 mL of mercury.
The stuff is really pretty cheap when bought in quantity: actually
about $100/kg for reagent grade from Aldrich. Of course a kg is a
smallish volume because it's surprisingly dense stuff.
<p>
As for a laser like a helium-mercury vapour laser, the amount of mercury 
necessary is actually pretty small. And besides, expense doesn't
stop anybody using a gold vapour laser. The cost of the fill is trivial
compared with capital and other operating costs.
<p>
Toxicity, too, never stopped anybody from using HF, F2, etc. in their
excimer lasers.
<p>
So, while not knowing the answer to the fellow's question, I guess
I'm saying that I don't agree with yours.
<p>
(From: Richard Alexander (RAlexan290@gnn.com).)
<p>
Well, it looks like you pretty well stopped my argument for the 
expense, but I think toxicity is still in play. In defense of that 
argument, I present my belief that excimer lasers are used mostly 
in industrial settings, away from most people (ok, I know there are 
medical excimers that offer some interesting promise). 
<p>
Maybe it's not too late for me to agree with the other poster that 
the wavelength put out by a mercury vapor laser is better produced 
by another type of laser. (I've had this discussion before, several 
years ago. It's just taking time for me to remember what I was 
told.) It seems like it isn't worth the bother of making the laser 
when HeNe and Argon Ion cover whatever the Hg vapor laser will do 
(ok, I admit I don't remember what lasers cover the Hg vapor laser 
wavelengths. You get the gist of my hazy memories.)
<p>
(From: Herman de Jong (h.m.m.dejong@phys.tue.nl).)
<p>
Mercury is used in home used thermometers, in thermostat switches for
heating the home,  in tilting switches, in high power reed switches,
in TL end related light tubes etc.
<p>
The  mercury laser uses maybe a few milligrams/year and it could be
trapped in an amalgam with silver, copper, zinc, not iron, about the
only exception. this effectively blocks mercury from reaching the
pump. 
<p>
A thermometer contains maybe a few hundred milligrams this is no
problem.
<p>
(From: Herman de Jong (h.m.m.dejong@phys.tue.nl).)
<p>
I agree with you David.
<p>
If I remember right the CW laser wasn't peculiarly intense but it had low
(single ended) optical feedback and the length of the vapour was a few
feet. and it was a DC discharge at a few kV with a neon transformer. It needs
a Helium flushing bottle and a vacuum pump. At that wavelength it probably
can't compete with the more powerful Ar+ lasers (514 nm, some are sealed) and
the much simpler green HeNe(sealed). The Neon transformer (6 kV, 100 mA?)
suggests also very poor efficiency. But for your home built laser it is a nice
project and even the vacuum pump can be very cheap by using the compressor
from a discarded air conditioner, refrigerator, or freezer.
<p>
The expensive setup would only be acceptable it the power could be high. I
suspect the population of the concerning state densities to be low although
they have very high absorption/stimulated emission probabilities. This means
the Sc.Am. is probably operating near saturation and it is hard to increase
output energy. More length will have a linear effect, higher vapour pressure
(T) is complicated. Maybe a different kind of discharge favors the population
of concerning states but it could be a lot more complicated then this.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg8">Comments on HeHg Lasers</A></h3>

(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I did a bit of a literature search on the helium-mercury and other mercuary
based lasers.
<p>
The Scientific American design is gain limited, but the power scales with tube
diameter up to say 2 inches, and gain scales pretty much proportionally to
length as well. The laser not only emits in the green and red, but has many
lines in the IR around 1.2 to 1.8 microns. It has lased continuously on the
visible lines in a hollow cathode type tube. It is also super-radient. It
lases after the excitation pulse has almost died out (lases in afterglow).
For all intents and purposes it seems like a ideal low cost laser and would
probably be useful to someone.
<p>
However I've noted two things, No one ever seems to have measured the output
power, save for one citation listed below and two, papers stopped appearing on
it after 1970 or so.  One wonders if it does not have some major fault, as it
was discovered by one of Spectra-Physics chief scientists, and yet nobody
makes it commercially?
<p>
<li>Gas Laser Technology, Sinclair and Bell, ISBN 03-075385-6
<p>
The above book has plans for a two meter long Scientific American style
design and a hollow cathode design excited by a thyratron based pulser, it
does 10 W pulsed on the red line.
<p>
This still leaves the question, Why is it not in Use?
<p>
Here are some papers to check out:
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Quasi-CW laser action from Mercury III lines", Burkhard, Luethi, Seelig,
 Optical Communication, 18(4), pp. 485-487, 1976.
<p>
 Summary states: "Quasi CW operation of 3 laser lines, 650.1 nm, 521.0 nm
 479.7 nm, was obtained in a pure Hg, very low pressure discharge.
 These lines are the Hg-III 5d86s2-5d96p transitions. A per pulse output
 power of 40 W at 650.1, 25 w at 479.7 and 5w at 521.0 was observed."
<p>
<li>"Fabrication of Wide Bore Hollow Cathode Mercury(I) Ion Lasers",
 Wieder, Myers, Fisher, et. al., Review of Scientific Instruments, 38(10),
 pp. 1538-1540, 1967.
<p>
 Summary reads: Using the 202 isotope of Hg (<sup>202</sup>Hg), gain as high
 as 120 mW/cm was obtained in a 2 to 5 cm diameter tube.  However, gain varies
 over an order of magnitude as it is very sensitive to the temperature profile
 along the tube.  Used 30 mg of Hg.  Entire tube must be strongly heated. Used
 cathode of 20 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter with ring anodes one cm away.
 Notes problems with fringe fields from any sharp edge of glass within 2.5 cm
 of cathode. Cathode must be closely fitted (1 mm gap) to outer glass wall to
 transfer heat.
</ul>
<p>
Now we know a few reasons why mercury based lasers aren't commercial:
The temperature variation, plus <sup>202</sup>Hg isn't cheap. Along with a
thyratron, it shoots itself in the foot.  Xenon is looking a lot better
then Hg, except that a turbo or diffusion pump is needed to get there. Most
stuff I'm reading now says 10 to 20 microns for xenon III-IV ions, to get
the really screaming lines.
<p>
(From: David Demmer (ddemmer@physics.utoronto.ca).)
<p>
Well done!
<p>
The large bore size and scaling sound a lot like a copper or gold vapour laser,
i.e. unstable or planar multimode resonator. This would make it lose out to,
say a Kr ion laser for beam quality, and a copper/gold vapour for raw power in
the green or red.
<p>
On a different note, I don't know that the phrases "ideal low cost" and
"thyratron based" should appear in the same discussion ;->.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Aside from the cost issue of a thyratron pulsar, the need to keep fiddling with
the gas pressure/fill to maintain laser action in an efficient and stable
manner could be a factor in the lack of commercial viability.  Unlike a
fluorescent or high pressure discharge lamp using mercury vapor, the HeHg
laser would appear to operate at a very low pressure (1 or 2 Torr) where a
stable gas fill could not easily be achieved.  Therefore, some possibly
complex and costly feedback mechanism would be needed to produce a viable
product (possibly along the lines of a low flow CO2 laser).  This may push
it over the cliff so to speak when compared to alternatives like those
mentioned above.  However, it should be noted, that the helium-cadmium laser
has similar requirements but DOES fill a niche in wavelength where suitable
alternatives have not been readily available.

Then again, perhaps it was a simple business decision to go with Ar/Kr ion
rather than HeHg and now that any patents have run out, they are just keeping
its potential benefits and ease of construction quiet. :-)

If anyone does build or has built a HeHg laser, many experiments can be done
with the gas fill and cavity optics.  Chris Chagaris (pyro@grolen.com) told me
of a Hg vapor laser that used a small (1.5 mm) bore and used argon instead of
helium.  It put out many wavelengths in the blue and into the UV.  Anyone up
to trying all the noble gases in a Hg vapor laser tube?  How about radon? :)
If someone did do this, it would be easier to use white light optics, rather
than constantly interchanging your mirrors and having to re-align them.
Ball-and-socket joints might be nice for the Brewster windows as well since
this would permit their angles to be optimized for each wavelength.

<h3><A NAME="chgchg9">Discussion of Other Helium-Metal-Vapor Lasers</A></h3>

The following is edited from a set of posts on the USENET newsgroup
<A HREF="news:sci.optics">sci.optics</A>dealing with Helium-Cadmium (HeCd) and
other Helium-Metal-Vapor laser characteristics, design, and fabrication
including a home-built HeSe laser that should be relatively easy to construct.
Eventually, I hope to have a complete description, specifications, and a
diagram of the HeSe laser.  The entire thread was somehow triggered by a
request for information on home-built CO2 lasers but evolved into something
almost entirely unrelated after that discussion ran its course.
<p>
The HeCd laser is the only one of this class I know of to be readily available
commercially operating at blue (442 nm) and near-UV (325 nm) wavelengths.  The
basic design is similar to other gas lasers with the addition of some means of
heating Cd pellets contained in a reservoir inside the sealed tube.  Typical
power requirements are 800 to 2,000 VDC at 10 to 25 mA or more.  The vapor
pressure of the Cd, total tube pressure, tube current/voltage and temperature
all affect output power and several control loops may be present to maintain
one or more of these constant.
<p>

I agree that the typical "how do I build a powerful laser" posters are crude
hobbyists who really have no idea what is involved in building a working laser.
They are therefore likely to not know much about laser or high voltage/power
safety precautions either.
<p>
For myself, I have built a CO2 laser to serve in a (heavily supervised)
instructional laboratory session for undergraduate physics majors.  Think about
it: Is a physics major who really doesn't know how to build (or at least align
the cavity) of a laser really deserving of a B.S. degree when he graduates?
<p>
My next project: A HeCd laser.
<p>
(From: Thomas C. Sefranek (tcs@cmcorp.com).)
<p>
Wow!  Your getting a VERY blue output.  (If my memory serves me.)  Do you plan
a vapor trap?
<p>
(From: John Woodgate (jmw@jmwa.demon.co.uk).)
<p>
Even the light will be toxic! :)
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
A sealed HeCd tube poses no Cd hazard, unless you break it.  There is typically
some facility to trap Cd vapor within the tube to keep it from depositing on
the optical windows.  That is about the only bad thing that can happen, aside
from significant difficulties getting the vapor pressure of Cd correct while
at the same time getting the He partial pressure correct at operating temp.
<p>
Since it is difficult to properly evacuate and seal a sealed tube
without sophisticated vacuum equipment and knowledge of glass to metal
seals, annealing, bake-out, etc., it may be easier to build a flowing
gas tube.  I would do this with a helium flow manifold, preheater, a
heated (tube heating is of course microprocessor controlled for accurate
control of pressures) Cd pool, and a cold trap for Cd vapor at the
tube's exhaust port before the optical window and before the vacuum
pump.
<p>
I don't know if a flowing gas HeCd is more difficult than a sealed
tube.  It may be worth learning the glass to metal seal techniques (or
contracting a glassblower that knows it), and investing in the UHV
equipment.  
<p>
Certainly a flowing gas CO2 is much easier than a sealed tube, the
sealed variety requiring water cooling and a catalytic cathode that can
regenerate CO2 from dissociation fragments.  But HeCd may be the other
way around.
<p>
Anyone got any experience with HeCd engineering they'd like to share?
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
You might want to start with pulsed oxygen or xenon first to learn the
glassblowing mechanics, as those are more tolerant of dirt in the tube and
outgassing.   Xenon, oxygen and even neon, all lase in pulsed systems at
visible wavelengths.  Xenon and neon are green, and used to be used in pulsed
resistor trimmers.  Oxygen lases in the blue and yellow.  Just about any gas
element has laser transitions.  You never know what may work till you try.
See the section: <A HREF="lasercmg.htm#cmgtoc">Home-Built Pulsed Multiple Gas
(PMG) Laser</A> which presents a design similar to the one described in the
paper: "A Cold Cathode Pulsed Gas Laser" by R. K. Lomnes and J. C. Taylor, The
Review of Scientific Instruments (RSI), Vol. 42, No. 6, June, 1971, pp. 766.
This generic gas laser may be used with several different gases such as Ar,
Kr, and Xe, but also with oxygen (O2).
<p>
The O2 laser lases in the afterglow, in a medium bore diameter tube, mainly in
the yellow (559.2 nm), with much higher gain then mercury. It likes a long
tube and needs pulsed excitation.  The researchers who built this laser
claimed much higher power then pulsed argon using the same tube, even with
sub-optimal argon optics.  It is a simple design using glass tubing, aluminum
electrodes, and a Plexiglas box for cooling.  Like small CO2 lasers, it was
pumped in real time with a slow gas flow.  The authors opted for a thyratron
pulser to gain a lot more peak power but the basic neon sign power supply
charging a HV capacitor should work as well.
<p>
After you have mastered the pulsed gas lasers, maybe then move on to HeSn or
HeIn or HePb.
<p>
My only problem with the RSI lasers and the Hg design is nobody ever specs the
required transmission for the output couplers, which really is what determines
the power emitted by the laser. Too much transmission and it won't lase; too
little and you don't get any power out and the tube saturates, making it look
like it's not lasing well.  The problem is we usually only have the money for
one set of optics to try.
<p>
I used to own a long positive column self heated HeCd, a Liconix 401.  It only
lased in a range 5 mA wide at a tube current of about 250 mA tube current and
had the tube lagged with asbestos for a certain thermal time constant.  You cut
holes in a piece of fireproof paper to adjust the air flow over one end of the
tube to adjust the pumping of the cadmium from one end to the other via
cataphoresis as the tube aged.  It took 25 to 30 minutes to start lasing and
was very tricky to adjust at first. 
<p>
Modern tubes have a multisegmeted bore with multiple Cd sources, a glass frit
helium pump and a bunch of other things to condition things right.  So if you
do it, having an oven on the tube helps as well as active pressure control.
Helium pressure is probably going to be in the 7 torr range.
<p>
The toughest thing you will face is cutting the Brewster stems, the old thing
about using abrasives and a brass blade in a hacksaw doesn't work well.  You'll
need stress free windows and stems.  Lasing power more then anything else is
dependent on the window quality and axial angle tolerances.  A quartz window
not properly cut will have birefringence properties that may prevent lasing
entirely so you have to get good windows.  Fused silica will work for a lab
toy, but you'll have long term lifetime problems with them from solarization
and the output power will be lower.  You might wish to consider buying a few
glass to vacuum flange transitions to make your life easier.  And use a hot
cathode - older tubes used off the shelf fluorescent lamp cathodes.
<p>
If your willing to use Pyrex, the seals are inexpensive and off the shelf.  The
actual glassblowing for a straight tube is easy enought for a beginner to do.
There are a few good books on amateur glassblowing and a few days practice
should get you all the skills you need. Look for a glassblowing book by
C. L. Stong.

There are lots of people who will tell you not to try a project like a HeCd or
other Helium-Metal-Vapor laser, or that it cannot be done.  Don't listen!!.  I
very successfully built a Helium-Selenium (HeSe) laser 5 or 6 years ago.  It
still runs great - I fire it up in my basement every once in a while.  I used
a 1 meter confocal cavity with argon ion laser mirrors and got 100 mW CW of
multimode, multiwavelength light with lines from 540 nm to around 460 nm.  If
I had had a broadband cavity, I could have gotten 24 wavelengths from red to
UV! It was a difficult project with a very satisfactory conclusion.  Just use
caution around the chemicals, HV, and laser light. (BTW, selenium is actually
good for you in small quantities. :) Good luck!
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
Mark, care to share your bore diameter and length?  Partial pressures?  Tube
currents?
<p>
(From: Brian.)
<p>
Yes, please tell us more.  This sounds like a very fascinating laser. I'd like
to know more about what wavelengths are possible and at what relative powers,
plus anything else you care to share as well.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Very interesting.  I don't know about HeSe.  Only one question at this point:
<p>
I have figured that to control the metal vapor partial pressure you need only
know a little about its thermodynamics, then by controlling the tube
temperature, you control the metal vapor pressure.  Of course, avoiding
temperature gradients is important.  Is this on the right track?
<p>
Is yours a sealed tube or flowing?
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
The laser I built is based on cataphoresis for controlling the vapor pressure
of the selenium.  Selenium vapor is introduce at the anode end, is swept along
the plasma tube by cataphoresis, and deposited on the walls of the tube at the
cathode end.  The cataphoresis/deposition keeps the partial pressure of Se
constant in the gain region, allowing the laser gain to be achieved.  The
temperature of the Se source is quite critical, approximately 270 &deg;C
plus or minus a few degrees, but it is very easy to tune.  The temperature in
the bore needs to be hotter than that, but the plasma current self-heats this
section and is not critical at all as long as it is hotter than 270 &deg;C.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Ok, I understand that cataphoresis will maintain a constant pressure over the
tube length, but isn't the Se pressure still controlled by the temperature?
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
Absolutely.  The selenium is located in a sidearm of the tube, isolated from
the discharge.  An external, temperature controlled heater generates the proper
vapor pressure, the vapor expands up into the discharge, and gets swept down
the bore by cataphoresis.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Did you do any cataphoresis rate and thermodynamics calculations, or did you
just approximate someone else's construction?  It is funny how much you don't
need to know to make a laser.  Mechanical innovation is the primary
prerequisite, it seems, plus some EE wits.
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
Absolutely, again!
<p>
I did them a long time ago for a class in electrooptics in college, but the
reality of this kind of laser is that you just adjust the parameters to
maximize the gain.  A reasonably good way of measuring the potential gain
without having the laser actually oscillating is to measure the sidelight at
the max gain wavelength (520 nm) with a filter and a photodiode.  That way,
you can adjust the helium pressure, the selenium temperature, and the discharge
current and monitor the effects.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Since a plasma tube cathode is typically pretty hot, I would expect that end of
the tube to be hotter than the rest, and so unlikely to condense the Se.  Does
your Se condense *after* the cathode?  Or perhaps you cool the tube walls
around the cathode?  I guess you don't have to worry about deposition on the
cathode, huh.  But perhaps it wouldn't even matter if it happened.
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
After the capillary bore, I allow the diameter of the discharge tube to expand.
This allows a cooler region where the selenium can deposit before getting into
the cathode area.  As you say, the cathode runs quite hot, so I don't think
much Se lands there.  one of my prototype tubes did exactly what you say - the
Se was deposited behind the cathode in a cool area near the getter.  
<p>
The big problem is keeping the Se off the Brewster window on the cathode end of
the tube.  I elaborated on someone else's idea and run a reverse current of
about 10% discharge current to keep the Se off the window.  All will be clear
when I get my report done.
<p>
If the source temperature is too low, the plasma is the pink color of He.  If
it is too high, it turns a vivid dark blue.  If it is just right, it is bright
white!  The helium pressure is about 10 Torr, not very critical.
<p>
I have about 100 hours on the tube, and have seen almost no depletion of the Se
in my reservoir.  The construction is a sealed pyrex glass envelope with a 1 mm
bore plasma tube approx 0.8 meter long.  It has been sealed off for >6 years
with epoxy sealed brewster windows, and it still works!
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Now that is impressive.  I have done a few glass/epoxy/metal vacuum seals, and
have found them remarkably good for the ease of performing them.  From what I
have read so far, glass/metal seals are not trivial.  Good to hear about a
sealed tube holding up with epoxy seals.  I wonder, just hardware store epoxy,
or something special?
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
Special.  I was using Epotek 305, and it worked quite well.  I have recently
discovered another substance, Vac-Seal, which has an incredibly low vapor
pressure and is silicone based, and they promote it for general purpose vacuum
sealing and sealing laser windows.  Works great on some x-ray tubes I build at
work - several years of pinch-off with no degradation yet.
<p>
The laser tube is about 50% more complicated than a HeNe system, but gives much
more output.  The gain of the brightest lines is about 5%/meter, so surplus
argon laser mirrors work very well.  As far as I can tell, the only reason the
Se laser never became commercially viable is that the lines are so close
together that it is difficult to select just one with a prism selector.  It has
a really nice green line.
<p>
(From: Steve.)
<p>
I've got something to cure the separation problem, a PCAOM.  That stands for
Polychromatic Acousto-Optic Modulator, it's really a sort of AOTF that can
amplitude modulate up to 8 lines from a given laser.  We use them for color
control on laser shows.  With a little work, it could be reprogrammed for the
HeSe lines.  BTW, it keeps all the lines colinear so you don't need huge arrays
of mirror mounts and dichroic optics to do color separation and recombination.
You shoot a white beam in and get controlled colors out and a waste beam.  It
can control lines as close together as 3 nm.  Cost is about $1,800 for the 4
channel and $3,500 for the 8 channel units.
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
I have been planning to write up the project but have been very busy lately.
There has been enough interest that I will try to get a complete description
and photos on Sam Goldwasser's laser FAQ site as soon as I can.  I will alert
this newsgroup when I have it completed.  Wish I could get alt.laser - my ISP
doesn't provide it.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Now your making me feel guilty.  I've got some CO2 photos, but I don't know
when I can get them scanned.  So damn busy.  This HeSe is very interesting.
You are making me think about doing that instead of HeCd.
<p>
What kind of total output power are you getting?  I envision 10 to 50 mW,
right?
<p>
(From: Mark.)
<p>
I got a little over 100 mW, multi-line, multi-mode.  It was enough that
focussed with a lens, I could melt holes in my black Swiss Army knife.
A new standard for laser output?? :)
<p>
There is a good survey article on metal vapor ion lasers in Scientific American
back in the early 70's.  They talk quite a bit about the HeSe laser, and give
journal references for some of the important work.
<p>
(From: Chris.)
<p>
Thanks, I'll be checking that out some time.
<p>
(From: Keith (Thallium204@aol.com).)
<p>
I'm sure you know that thallium is named after its strong green spectral
line.  It just happens that it has a very low melting/vapor point, and like
mercury needs no buffer gas to lase, it just needs a vacuum. It is not very
critical of vapor pressure as in the HeCd and HeSe.  The use of argon or neon
as a buffer does make it more efficient but is not absolutely needed.  The
mirrors from a dead green HeNe laser tube work fine (as long as their radius
of curvature is consistent with stability for the resonator).

<h3><A NAME="chgscho">Steve's Comments on HeHg Optics</A></h3>

(From Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Without knowing the required reflectance and radius of curvature (RoC), the
following comments can only be very general.
<p>
Nothing off-the-shelf is close in the required diameter, RoC,
transmission, and wavelength except maybe some doubled YAG optics for
the green line and a few argon ion high reflectors.  Dye laser OCs cut for
the 620 nm region might be a option but they usually have a very short
radius and a 5% transmission which may be too much. You might try two
Newport or Thorlabs flats with BB or BD coatings (both broad-band high
reflectors) to get going as a test and take your beam off the Brewster
reflection. That would set you back $80 to $150 for two flats at 1"
diameter. Flat to Flat is very hard to align.  At least one mirror
should have say a 2 to 4 meter RoC. Even a BD1 coating is
going to leak some small amount of beam out if your lasing and the
back of the optic is not frosted. But it would let you see how much
gain you have.  The Chinese and the Bulgarians will run custom coating
lots at around $1000 to $2000 a lot if you supply the blanks and your
specs are not too tight. US coating runs are something like 2 to 5
times that when I've looked into it.

<h3><A NAME="chghgn2">Hg:N2 (No Helium) Laser</A></h3>

Another type of mercury laser doesn't use any helium at all and has very
simple construction.  It is optically pumped with UV discharge lamps
(one version uses what are basically fluorescent lamps with no phosphors
like germicidal or EPROM eraser lamps).  It lases at 546.1 nm, close to the
wavelength of the green HeNe laser which is 543.5 nm (though this is just
a coincidence).
<p>
There was even a low cost ($500) "educational version" of such a laser.
It had a <i>peak</i> output power of less than 1 mW but at the time
(pre-1990), was by far the cheapest green laser available.  See
<A HREF="hgn2p1.jpg">Photo of QE Technology EL-100 Hg:N2 Laser</A>
(Courtesy of Chad Andersen).
As can be seen, there isn't much in there besides the laser tube with its
mercury reservoir, a pair of UV lamps with a couple of electronic
components to run them, and the cavity reflector.  Apparently, the rear
mirror (under the black thing at the rear?) could be adjusted to get all
sorts of higher order spatial modes. :)  Although these are 20 year old
lasers with a soft-seal tube, the mercury will oxidize and combine with
any oxygen that should leak in, so if the lamps work, the laser may
still lase.

 Abstract: The operating characteristics of continuous-wave (CW) at. Hg lasers
 are described.  Operating at 546.1 nm, the laser is optically pumped by
 d.c. Hg discharge lamps.  The laser has high perceptual brightness and
 potentially low noise and high stability.  Experiment and theory aspects of
 the laser and its performance are discussed, and the effectiveness of
 various optical coupling schemes is considered.  Evidence for
 absorption loss due to Hg dimers is presented, and some results are
 given for direct measurement of this loss by tunable dye laser.
