<h2>Introduction to Vacuum Systems and Technology</h2>

Many areas of scientific research and industrial production require vacuum
conditions - where most (or as much as possible) of the air has been removed
leaving little or nothing behind.  While written specifically for the needs of
home-built gas lasers, much of what follows is applicable to other medium to high
vacuum systems and includes some general testing, maintenance, and repair
information not found elsewhere.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs0">Vacuum Systems for Home-Built Gas Lasers</A></h3>

All but one of the gas lasers described in the chapters on specific home-built
lasers require a decent vacuum system to remove air from the laser
tube so that it can be back-filled with the required lasing gases at a low
pressure.  These include the HeNe, Ar/Kr, CO2, HeHg, CuCl/CuBr, and multiple
gas (PMG) lasers.  The N2 laser requires only a 'low' vacuum since it runs at
a substantial fraction (e.g., perhaps 20%) of atmospheric pressure and some
versions can run at ambient pressure (1 atm).
<p>
The vacuum system serves three functions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Remove (nearly) all the air from the apparatus.  For almost all the gas
 lasers we will be describing, air is poison.  It must be purged from the
 tube before the required gases can be admitted.  Only with most of the air
 gone, can proper and efficient lasing action take place.  Even a small
 amount of residual air may result in erratic or weak operation - or no
 output beam at all!
<p>
<li>Pump out residual gases resulting from outgassing from the glass, seals,
 adhesives, finger prints, and other contamination on the surface and in the
 crevices of the laser tube assembly.  Some materials like vacuum grease do
 not cause problems.  However, a single finger print can represent a
 veritable reservoir of unwanted vaporous contamination!
<p>
<li>Control the pressure of the gas fill as individual gases or gas mixtures
 are admitted to the apparatus either prior to or during operation as the
 electrical discharge buries gas molecules under sputtered electrode material
 or chemical reactions affect the proportion of each type of gas.
</ul>
<p>
By the standards of the vacuum industry, our requirements are modest and are
generally called a "medium" vacuum - not the sort of situation where every
last "particle" of air needs to be removed but still 1/100th to 1/10,000th
of normal atmospheric pressure.  These are not generally considered a "high"
vacuum (though that's what may be found in catalog listings for the types of
mechanical vacuum pumps and gauges that are used) but they are still
not the sort of thing you come across in daily life.  However, to be able
to fill the laser with (mostly) pure gases, it is desirable for the vacuum
system to go substantially lower in pressure than that at which the laser
operates.  And this includes the upper end of the high vacuum range - down
to perhaps 1,000,000th of normal atmospheric pressure.
<p>
I am gradually putting together a vacuum system (or at least acquiring parts!)
and may have an interest in your cast-off or excess vacuum equipment
(relatively small items, not complete ion beam machines!) or accessories.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs1">What does a Pressure of Such-and-Such Really
 Mean?</A></h3>

We always hear about the barometric pressure - or the level of a vacuum - in
terms of 'mm or mercury' or 'inches'.  1 atmosphere (at sea level under some
unidentified ideal conditions) is also said to be 14.7 pounds per square inch.
Why?
<p>
The earth is covered with a vast ocean of air.  Despite common experiences,
even air has mass and mass implies weight.  We know it has volume or else
your automobile would have a real problem with flat tires.  Most of the volume
(the contribution from the volume of the the protons, neutrons, and electrons
in the atoms are negligible but not precisely zero) results from the constant
motion of the molecules (in air or other gas) bouncing against each-another
due to their thermal motion.  This also keeps the air in a gaseous state.  At
really low temperatures, the motion is reduced resulting in liquid and solid
phases of even air.  At exactly absolute zero (0 &deg;K or -459 &deg;F or
-273 &deg;C) all motion ceases.  However, even then most of the volume of
the frozen air is still empty space - but that is another story.
<p>
At sea level under average conditions, the column (actually an inverted
truncated pyramid if you want to be strictly correct) of air above 1 square
inch of area would weigh 14.7 pounds if you could capture, compress, and
package them and plop them down on a delicatessen scale!  As you move away
from the earth, this 'column' of air becomes increasingly rarified approaching
a prefect vacuum at 50 miles or so - else low earth orbit satellites would not
stay up very long due to air friction.
<p>
It turns out that a column of mercury with an area of 1 square inch and
29.92 inches (760 mm) high weighs exactly 14.7 pounds as well (what a
coincidence, huh?).  So, if you take a closed-end tube a little more than
30 inches long, fill it with mercury, and invert it in a pool of mercury,
the pressure of the surrounding air will be able to support a column of
mercury 30 inches high.  The space above the mercury will be a decent vacuum.
You have made a mercury barometer.  (Strictly speaking, there will be mercury
vapor in that space but it won't affect the height by much.)
<p>
If you were to take this barometer and place it inside a vacuum vessel and
start up the pump, the column would go down until at the point of a perfect
vacuum (not achievable but close), it would be precisely level with the
surrounding pool of mercury.
<p>
Note that the diameter of the tube doesn't matter - wider implies a heavier
column of mercury but the area of the air acting on the column changes by the
same factor.  In fact, it can have pretty much any convoluted shape you want
(except that if portions are too thin, surface tension becomes a factor) as
long as it is sealed and totally filled with mercury.  Why this is so is left
as an exercise for the student!
<p>
The corresponding height of 1 atmosphere for water is about 34 feet - a column
of water with a cross sectional area of 1 inch and height of 34 feet weighs
14.7 pounds.  This also means that for a diver, the water pressure increases
by 1 atm for each 34 feet of depth.  Thus it is not surprising that there are
significant problems in deep sea diving!  You have to go up by MILES in air
for the pressure to decrease by a substantial fraction of 1 atm but need only
go down 34 feet in water to increase pressure by 1 atm!
<p>
Note that the most likely form of a pressure you are familiar with is the
reading on the gauge you use when checking or filling your automobile or
bicycle tires.  However, this is calibrated relative to the surrounding
pressure of around 1 atm.  Thus, the actual pressure inside a tire will
actually be 1 atm + the reading on the gauge.  And you thought you had a
perfect vacuum inside that flat tire when the reading was 00.0! :-)
<p>
Similarly, a vacuum can be measured relative to atmospheric pressure and
this is often done for the sort of vacuum you find in an automobile engine
intake manifold, vacuum hold down plate, and other familiar applications.
However, these readings represent the difference between one large number
(local atmospheric pressure) and another large number (your vacuum).  Since
weather conditions (i.e., high and low barometric pressure) can result in a
variation of 1/2 inch of mercury or more, such measurements will fluctuate
and aren't very useful when the <i>absolute</i> level of vacuum is what's
important - as with gas lasers and most other scientific uses of vacuum.
<p>
Here are some units and relationships commonly found in dealing with vacuums:
<p>
<ul>
<li>1 bar (bar) = 750.06 Torr.
<li>1 atmosphere (atm) = 1.0133 bar = ~760 mm of mercury (Hg) = ~29.92 inches of Hg.
<li>1 Torr (T) = 1 mm of Hg = ~1/760 atm = ~1/750 bar = 1000 micron.
<li>1 Pascal (Pa) = 0.01 millibar (mbar) = 0.0075 Torr.
</ul>
<p>
If you are totally confused at this point, for a wonderful description of
these units and their history, see:
<A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/units.htm">The Electronic
Bell Jar - Pressure Units</A>.  Some high vacuum equipment suppliers have
conversion charts and other related information.  See for example,
<A HREF="http://www.lds-vacuum.com/techtips.htm">LDS Vacuum Products Techtips
Page</A>.
<p>
Or, here is an instant conversion chart.  To convert from the units in a

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs2">What is a Low, Medium, or High Vacuum?</A></h3>

Vacuums come in all shapes and sizes - and I am not referring to vacuum
cleaners!  Any local reduction in air pressure significantly below standard
atmospheric pressure (760 mm of mercury, 14.7 pounds per square inch) is
termed a vacuum (except by your local weather person who talks about 'low
pressure areas').  For convenience (and because there must have been a meeting
of elder statesman with nothing better to do), the Torr in honor of some
Italian named Torrecelli is used to designate a pressure of 1 mm of mercury
I guess referring to 'Torrecellis' all the time would be too confusing. :-)
<p>
The
<A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/fig1b.gif">Electronic Bell Jar Vacuum Chart</A>
provides a nice instant summary of pump types, gauges, and applications, as a
function of the level of vacuum.
<p>
The following dividing lines between low, medium, high, and ultra-high vacuums
are somewhat arbitrary but will be convenient for discussion:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Biosphere:</b> 1 atm (760 Torr) to .5 atm.  At sea level, the average
 pressure is about 1 atm.  The weather person will talk about 'inches of
 mercury' instead of 'mm of mercury' since most people in the USA at least
 haven't entered the metric age. :-)  29.92 inches = 760 mm.  The wildest storm
 imaginable doesn't produce variations beyond a few percent of this nominal
 value.
<p>
 Mountain climbers have to endure reduced pressure and above about 10,000
 feet, may require (or at least benefit from) breathing equipment.  Anyone
 who has traveled by air knows  the standard speech at the beginning of
 each flight "....should oxygen be  needed, the compartments overhead....".
 This would also happen above about 10,000 feet.
<p>
 Astronauts on American spacecraft (at least they used to), breath unaided at
 a pressure of perhaps 1/5 of an atm because they breath nearly pure oxygen.
 Since in the normal atmosphere, oxygen is only about 18 percent of the total
 mixture (most of the rest is nitrogen with a little CO2 and inert gases
 thrown in), the resulting  biological activity (and the flammability of
 common materials, for that matter) is about the same but there is no need to
 carry the approximately 80% of useless other gases and the stesses on the
 spacecraft structure (from the difference between the internal pressure and
 the vacuum outside) are reduced by 80% as well.
<p>
<li><b>Low vacuum:</b> 1 atm (760 Torr) to 100 Torr. This is something you may
 have dealt with - the suction of a vacuum cleaner, spark advance manifold on
 your automobile, a siphon, and so forth.  None of these is anywhere near the
 bottom end of this range - all are probably better than 0.5 atm and usually
 much closer to 1 atm.  Even super high performance vacuum cleaners don't go
 below about 0.9 atm.  All except the smallest incandescent light bulbs are
 filled with inert gas at a fraction of 1 atm as well.  (The smallest ones
 have a pretty decent high vacuum in them.)
<p>
 A low vacuum can be obtained by any number of simple mechanical means
 including fans and centrifugal blowers, piston and rotary pumps, aspirators,
 siphons, chemical combustion and other reactions (which use up the air),
 etc.  Liquids boil at reduced temperature - often room temperature - in a
 modest vacuum but minimal or no precautions are needed to prepare surfaces
 and equipment since any outgassing is small compared to the remaining air.
<p>
 I did a few very scientific experiments to determine values of two
 types of vacuums with which everyone is familiar:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Vacuum cleaners (dead headed into a Bourdon tube vacuum gauge):
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Sears wet-dry "shop" vac (5 HP model, whatever that means - maybe that
   it makes 5 HP worth of noise!) - Lowest pressure was 28 inches of mercury or
   still more than 94 percent of atmospheric pressure.  Hardly a dent at all!
   I was actually quite surprised at how bad this was even though the suction
   felt very strong (no doubt due to the large diameter hose).
<p>
  <li>Small no-name shop vac - 27 inches of mercury, actually better than the
   big noisy beast, above.
<p>
  <li>Household canister vac (Filter Queen, 40+ years old but still lively) -
   not quite down to 28 inches of mercury.  Another no-name canister vac
   produced a similar reading.
  </ul>
<p>
  So, next time the friendly vacuum cleaner salesperson calls, forget the
  oatmeal test, let them try a Bourdon tube gauge instead! :)
<p>
 <li>Human powered no-assist vacuums:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Human mouth (mine, at least) - Sucking as hard as I could from the
   Bourdon tube gauge using my vast experience with plugged up soda straws
   using various mouth parts as pistons and valves: 20 inches of mercury
   (2/3 atm).  I was also surprised at how surprisingly good this was,
   but still useless for most gas lasers.  And it would definitely be
   a lot of work to evacuate a vessel of any size!  Have the local ER
   on standby if you try. :)
<p>
   However, note that normal straw sucking would result in hardly any vacuum
   at all, only needing to raise a fluid by a few inches; 15 inches of mercury
   is like drinking through a straw from a container about 16 feet below you!
<p>
  <li>Human diaphragm (mine, again) - Sucking as hard as I could without
   using any mouth parts (before turning blue): 27 inches of mercury, no
   better than a cheap vacuum cleaner!
  </ul>
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Medium vacuum:</b> 100 to 0.1 Torr.  This is the range where most of
 the gas lasers operate.  In addition, neon signs, fluorescent lamps, and other
 glow discharge tubes, distillation, vacuum packing, and so forth require
 medium vacuums.
<p>
 A medium vacuum can be achieved with a high quality mechanical pump.
<p>
<li><b>High vacuum:</b> 0.1 to 10<sup>-6</sup> Torr.  Crooks radiometer (that
 thing with the black and silver vanes that spins in Sunlight), small light
 bulbs, thermos bottles, cold cathode (gas type) X-ray and Crooks tubes, mass
 spectrometers, etc.  At the bottom end of this range true vacuum electronics
 technology becomes possible but performance, reliability, and lifetime will
 likely be limited due to the relatively large amount of remaining gas
 molecules!
<p>
 A high vacuum usually typically requires a multi-step pumping scheme with a
 rotary mechanical pump going down to 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>-3</sup> Torr
 followed by a diffusion, turbo-molecular, or other true high vacuum pump.
<p>
<li><b>Ultra-high vacuum:</b> 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-14</sup> Torr.  The
 actual vacuum inside the CRT of your computer monitor or TV is probably at a
 level of 10<sup>-9</sup> or better.  For many processes, the ultimate quality
 in terms of yield and performance can directly tied to the quality of the
 vacuum used in the manufacturing processes. Other devices operating in this
 range include: vacuum tubes (valves for those of you on the other side of
 the lake) of all sizes, vacuum fluorescent display tubes, modern hot cathode
 X-ray tubes; particle accelerators like cyclotrons and synchrotrons and
 their associated particle storage rings; scanning and transmission electron
 microscopes.
<p>
 Even if the final vacuum is modest (e.g., 1 to 10 Torr), being able to pump
 down to an ultra-high vacuum may be needed to purge the tube or whatever of
 contaminants with a small number of pump down/backfill cycles and minimal
 use of expensive gases.
<p>
 In addition to mechanical and diffusion or turbo pumps, additional means are
 required to achieve an ultra-high vacuum including exotic ion pumps, cryo
 pumps, cold traps, and chemical getters.  Surfaces exposed to the vacuum must
 be immaculate - a single fingerprint can mess things up for days!
<p>
 To put a 10<sup>-9</sup> Torr vacuum into perspective: If all of the gas
 molecules remaining inside a typical 17 inch monitor CRT that had been
 manufactured at this level of vacuum were rounded up, captured, and returned
 to normal atmospheric pressure, they would occupy a volume of space less
 than 25 um on a side - roughly 1/10th the diameter of the dot in the
 explanation point at the end of this sentence or half the diameter of a
 human hair!  Yet, inside the CRT, there would still be approximately
 1,000,000,000,000 gas molecules remaining for unsuspecting electrons to run
 into!
<p>
<li><b>Interstellar space:</b> less than 10<sup>-19</sup> Torr.  It is
 estimated that in the space between galaxies, there may only be a few
 molecules per cubic meter - which isn't a lot!  Think of how much easier
 it would be to 'fill' CRTs with a vacuum out between the galaxies!  Of
 course, transportation costs might eat up your profit margin. :-)
</ul>
<p>
You may also hear the term 'hard vacuum'.  I don't know if there is a precise
definition for this either but I would assume that anything with a low enough
pressure to behave similarly to a perfect vacuum from the normal experiences
point of view would qualify.  Also note that in terms of the strength required
of a vacuum vessel, the difference between a vacuum of 1 Torr and
10<sup>-19</sup> Torr is irrelevant.  Why? :)

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs3">How Good a Vacuum System is Really Needed?</A></h3>

None of the gas lasers we will be discussing requires a vacuum better than
about 0.1 Torr when operating.  However, in order to clear them of contaminants
in a timely and economical manner (without a semi-inifinite number of purge
and back-fill cycles), it is desirable to be able to pump down to a much lower
pressure than this.  The better your vacuum capability - to a point - the
easier it will be to obtain a pure gas fill.  Less gas will be needed (due to
fewer pump-down and back-fill cycles) and time will be saved.  However, there
is no need to go overboard.  My rule-of-thumb (read: wild guess) is that a
vacuum system capable of reliably pumping down to 1/100th of the lowest
operating pressure is adequate for dealing with a laser tube that has a single
vacuum/gas fill port.  Pumping to 1/10th the desired final pressure may even
be good enough if the laser tube is fabricated to have a gas-fill port at one
end and a vacuum port at the other.  For a flowing gas design (e.g., CO2
laser), the requirements are even less stringent and just being able to
maintain the desired operating pressure may be good enough.  If you think you
will be building more than one type of gas laser, make sure this applies to
the one with the lowest operating pressure.  Also keep in mind that some types
of lasers (like the HeNe) are particularly sensitive to the slightest traces
of unwanted gases and a better vacuum system would definitely be advantageous
for these.
<p>
Unless you have worked with a decent vacuum system in the past, own a HVAC
service business, or just happened to pick up something that looked like a
pump of some kind at a garage sale (but you weren't really sure and got
lucky), you don't have the needed equipment!  However, an adequate 'medium'
vacuum system can be put together for less than $400 - possibly a lot less if
you are determined and somewhat resourceful.

<h3><A NAME="cvasaf">Safety Issues when Working with Vacuum Systems</A></h3>

The following relate directly to the vacuum equipment.  There may (and usually
are) many additional issues for a given application, particularly with respect
to high voltage, X-ray production, and toxic or radioactive process chemicals.
See the additional safety information on these topics in the chapter:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#contoc">Amateur Laser Construction</A>.
<p>
<li>Vacuum vessels.  The potential energy of the atmosphere working on a vacuum
 is enormous.  Every square inch of surface area separating the atmosphere
 from an evacuated volume represents 14.7 pounds of force.  A gallon jar with
 the air pumped out may have over 1.5 TONS of force attempting to crush it.
 The results of an implosion can be spectacular and are something you don't
 want to experience first-hand.
<p>
 Note that it is the difference between atmospheric pressure and that of your
 vacuum that determines the stress on the container - whether you are pumping
 down to 10 Torr or 10<sup>-14</sup> Torr is for all practical purposes
 irrelevant with respect to implosion risk!
<p>
<ul>
 <li>ALWAYS use proper vacuum vessels where large size containers are needed.
  Think of those bell jars used by the instructor in your high school
  physics class.  They had thick walls for a reason!  Pickle jars and common
  laboratory flasks are NOT designed to safely hold a vacuum!
<p>
  If you insist on trying these bombs, cover the whole affair with some sort
  of shatter-proof outer cover like a thick solidly constructed Plexiglas
  shield but I don't recommend this in any case.
<p>
 <li>Small glass tubes, fittings, valves, and so forth can be used safely.  My
  rule-of-thumb would be that less than 1 inch in diameter for thin-walled
  lab glassware is usually fine.  Somewhat larger is probably fine but they
  would need to be examined on a case-by-case basis.  Thick-walled glassware
  is stronger but it is better to err on the side of caution!
<p>
 <li>NEVER use any glass components that have serious surface damage such as
  dings or scratches as these significantly weaken the entire structure.
  The larger and more irregular the shape of the object, the greater the
  likelihood of an unfortunate accident.
<p>
 <li>Convex shapes (think: arches) are inherently stronger than planar or
  concave shapes.  Keep this in mind if you need to evacuate a strange
  shaped container.
<p>
 <li>Install some sort of implosion protection around any evacuated glass
  vessels unless they are so strong as to be unquestionably safe.  And
  it won't hurt to have these around ALL glass vessels.  In particular, ion
  gauge tubes should have a perforated metal cover both for this purpose and
  electrical shielding.  Do NOT attach or remove connectors to fragile glass
  feed-throughs (such as on ion gauge tubes) when the system is under vacuum
  as stressing them may cause fracture and implosion.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>There may be potentially lethal high voltages on ionization gauges (hot
 filament, Penning, etc.), ion pumps, and other vacuum related equipment in
 addition to the deadly voltages likely present on any laser or other
 experimental apparatus!  The power to mechanical pumps and other vacuum
 equipment should be attached in accordance with the National Electrical Code
 (USA) or relevant regulations in your country.  All electrical equipment
 and accessible metal parts of the rest of the vacuum system should be
 connected together with thick wire and Earth grounded.
<p>
<li>The rotating parts of your mechanical pump and the hot surfaces of an oil
 diffusion pump are also potential hazards.  Turbo pumps must be properly
 anchored and their inlet protected from the ingress of debris which may
 result in catastrophic damage.

<h2>Vacuum Pumps</h2>

Unless you have a lot of money to spend on a trip to into outer space to "fill"
a bottle with a nearly perfect vacuum, some means will be required to obtain
a suitable vacuum here on Earth.  In almost all applications, this will
consist of one or more types of high vacuum pumps.  These are specifically
designed to achieve pressure levels that while not quite comparable to the
molecule per cubic centimeter claimed to be found in the space between
galaxies, can come quite close, at least by terrestrial standards.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs4">Types of Vacuum Pumps</A></h3>

Various kinds of vacuum pumps are needed to pump down to different levels of
vacuum.  Generally, rotary vane mechanical pumps are used for low to medium
vacuums (even though they are often called "high vacuum pumps"!) and other
types are needed to go below this range.  Note that I often drop the "vane"
from "rotary vane mechanical pump" but most are of this type.  There are also
rotary piston and rotary scroll pumps but these are less common for vacuum
applications.
<p>
See <A HREF="vacpumps.gif">Vacuum Pumps Suitable for Various Home-Built
Lasers</A> for diagrams of the types of vacuum pumps described below that are
relevant for our purposes.  See the links in the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvavsrl">Vacuum Systems References, Links, Forums</A>
for more complete information on the operating principles of the pumps
described below (as well as many other topics).
<p>
There are many types of mechanical pumps but they are usually based on one of
two basic principles: positive displacement (perhaps these should be called
negative displacement in dealing with vacuums!) and turbo-molecular:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Positive displacement pumps operate on principles that Archemedes would
 have understood (though the required precision machining would look like
 magic to him), sucking in air and expelling it using a piston or rotary
 mechanism with valves or vanes of some sort to make sure the working fluid
 (i.e., the air or gas in our case) moves in the proper direction.  A piston
 pump is a type of "entrainment" pump whereby gas entering the inlet is
 trapped inside and then must be expelled as a separate part of the
 operating cycle.  A rotary vane pump is a type of "concentration" pump
 whereby gas entering the inlet is compressed and expelled out the outlet
 in one continuous operation.
<p>
 The rotary vane type is the most common 'roughing' or 'backing' pump for
 use with high vacuum systems.  (These terms indicate that there is another
 pump or pumps for actually going from a pressure of a few milliTorr
 to a pressure of 10<sup>-6</sup> Torr or lower.)  This is due to their
 relative simplicity and their ability to achieve decent performance with
 reasonable tolerances in the machining of their component parts.  A shaft and
 rotor mounted off-center in a cylindrical pump chamber rotates a set of
 spring-loaded sliding vanes (usually 2 but possibly 4 or more).  The
 vanes sweep a variable size volume which increases on the vacuum (intake)
 side and decreases on the exhaust (outlet) side.  The entire mechanism is
 totally immersed in low vapor pressure oil.  While the oil is essential
 for lubrication and cooling, its most critical function is to seal the
 spaces between the moving parts - there are no other seals between the rotor,
 vanes, pump chamber, and end-plates.  Unlike a piston pump in which the
 ultimate vacuum is determined by the dead space above the piston and
 in the valves when the piston is at the top of its stroke, a well
 constructed rotary vane pump's performance is limited mainly by the
 back-streaming of gases from the oil.  In most cases where such a pump
 fails to meet expectations with respect to ultimate vacuum, the cause is
 contamination of the oil (or the use of improper oil with a high vapor
 pressure) rather than a problem with the pump mechanism.
<p>

 Technical Notes</A>.  (Local copy should this link decay:
 <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/vacuum/rvpnotes.htm">Copy of Lesker's
 Rotary Vane Mechanical Pump Technical Notes</A>.)
<p>
<li>Below 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr, another type of pump in
 addition to the mechanical 'roughing' pump is required.  This is placed
 in-line between the container you are trying to evacuate and the roughing
 pump.  In the past, the oil diffusion pump was the workhorse of high vacuum
 technology but this has been largely replaced by turbo pumps and other higher
 tech alternatives, see below.  (Early diffusion pumps used mercury as the working
 fluid but the modern synthetic oils are better and are not poisonous).  A small oil
 diffusion pump is still useful for a basic high vacuum
 system and available on a modest budget.  They are simple in construction
 and easy to maintain but may require tap water cooling and are subject to
 contamination depending on what type of residual stuff was left in your
 system.  So, if you come across a good deal on a working turbo pump, ion
 pump, or other more high-tech alternative, consider that instead of - or in
 addition to - a diffusion pump.
<p>
 A diffusion pump has no moving parts (at least at the macroscopic level).
 An electric heating element in its base boils a small quantity of a special
 'diffusion pump oil' inside a sort of tower or percolator structure which
 has vents to direct the jets of oil vapor downward toward the higher
 pressure region (to the mechanical pump) where it condenses on the cool
 surfaces of the pump housing and is recycled.  In in the process, air and
 other gas molecules are dragged along with the oil vapor.  When the oil vapor
 condenses near the bottom (higher pressure) part of the diffusion pump, the
 trapped molecules are released and sucked up by the roughing pump.  The
 actual pressure differential between the top and bottom is miniscule - only
 a fraction of a Torr (and the diffusion pump cannot be fired up until the
 roughing pump has brought the vacuum down to this level).  But this is
 adequate to suck out most of the remaining air or other gas molecules and
 once it gets going, the pumping speed of a diffusion pump is quite
 impressive despite its passing resemblance to a coffee percolator.  I know
 what you're thinking. :)
<p>
 Diffusion pumps require cooling of their own.  This is usually tap water
 through a coil wrapped around their exterior though some use some sort of
 air cooling.
<p>
 For the cyclotron at my high school (right, how many high schools have
 atom smashers - but that is another story), we had an air-cooled glass oil
 diffusion pump (probably because no one else wanted it or even knew what
 it was).  Somehow, this fragile glass structure survived all sorts of
 catastrophies despite being located under the main vacuum chamber situated
 between the pole pieces of a magnet weighing several tons and joined by a
 clamp-type glass and O-ring seal..........  OK, I know you're curious.
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concyc">The Central High School
 Cyclotron</A>.
<p>
 An alternative to a diffusion pump that appears distinctly low-tech (but no
 doubt requires very high-tech manufacturing) is the turbo-molecular pump
 (or "turbo pump" for short).  Like the diffusion pump, the turbo pump is
 placed in-line with the roughing pump.  A multistage turbine running at
 very high speed generates a compression
 ratio of 10<sup>8</sup> <i>or more</i> for outlet pressures in the range of
 50 microns to 20 Torr (depending on model).  These represent an alternative to
 diffusion and ion pumps for going 'the last mile'.  Thus, an entirely
 mechanical high vacuum system is possible (and quite common).  You probably
 won't see one of these at your local hamfest but one may be gathering dust
 in the deep dark recesses of one of your University's physics labs.  They
 also appear on eBay from time-to-time but the final bid prices are usually
 quite high - typically around $1,000 for a small one - and that may not even
 include the controller!  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvashvs">A Small High Vacuum System</A>.
<p>
 Turbo pumps can achieve a very clean ultra-high vacuum but due to their high
 speed (up to 90,000 rpm or more!), are not very tolerant of abuse or debris
 entering their intake port.  And, at these speeds, mechanical bearings
 represent a maintenance item.  Some use a super high quality ceramic ball
 bearing with special oil lubrication at one end and a passive magnetic
 bearing at the other end (just a couple of ceramic ring magnets, one
 partially inside the other).  The best type use magnetic bearings throughout
 with the lower one usually being active feedback controlled.
<p>
 For more details on turbo-molecular and another related type, the molecular
drag pump, see <A HREF="http://www.lesker.com/CFDOCS/newweb/Vacuum_Pumps/Individual_Pumps/Turbo_and_Drag_Pumps/TurboMolecular_TechNotes.cfm">Lesker's

 "http://www.lesioq.streamcn.pl/LQ_items/Vacuum/Edwards-turbo_pump/">LesioQ's
 Edwards Turbo Pump Disassembly Page</A> for a dissection of one that must
 have lost a battle with some debris.
</ul>
<p>
Though no self respecting high vacuum system would be without at least one
of these high vacuum pumps, this is not really essential for most of
the gas lasers under discussion especially if you have a well maintained 2
stage (or better) mechanical pump.  However, if you come across a small
diffusion or turbo pump (almost any size would be adequate for laser tubes)
in good condition at a decent price, grab it.  You can never tell when your
interests might wonder in directions where a true high vacuum system would
be needed.
<p>
While not generally thought of as pumps, the following perform related
functions helping to rid the system of moisture and other unwanted volatile
materials:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Dryer.  A canister of a moisture absorbing chemical in the vacuum line may
 be desirable in addition to the cold trap. 
<p>
<li>Cold trap.  Many of the contaminants we wish to avoid/remove condense or
 freeze at relatively high temperatures (well, relatively speaking).  If a
 portion of the vacuum hose between the last pump in the chain is passed
 through a container of dry ice or liquid nitrogen, much of this material
 will be 'trapped' and effectively removed from circulation as long as the
 cold stuff doesn't evaporate.  Large vacuum systems will have a liquid
 nitrogen cooled baffle between the diffusion pump and the vacuum chamber.
</ul>
<p>
In addition to helping to achieve a high vacuum, a dryers and cold traps may
also help to prevent contamination to the oil in the vacuum pumps.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Getter.  A material which chemically combines with most gases.  These are
 familiar as the metallic spots inside all vacuum tubes (remember those?)
 including CRTs as well as some laser tubes.  Since the getter would be
 used up if allowed to be exposed to air, it must be "activated" once the
 vacuum device (e.g., laser tube) is sealed off.  The getter is
 insurance to capture the last renegade gas molecules once the pumps are no
 longer present.  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercon.htm#conghb">Getters in Home-Built Lasers</A>.  However,
 there is also something called a "getter sublimation pump" which isn't the
 same.  See below.
</ul>
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
You really want an ion pump or a getter sublimation pump a.k.a. Titanium Pump
(TP), or if you're really lucky, a turbo pump, although they don't hold up to
abuse too well.  (A debris screen should be installed on the turbo pump inlet
and even with that, extreme care must be taken to assure nothing other than gas
gets to the high speed turbine blades.)
<p>
Diffusion pumps are old news and outdated, they run hot, and some are huge!
Depending on what is being pumped, they may need to be torn down and cleaned
frequently.  Small ion pumps are about $1,200 rebuilt. maybe $250 for the pump
and $1,000 for the controller after rebuild, which means they are dirt cheap
if you find a used one.  I've seen a few diffusion pumps given away in the
past few years but they really were clunkers and sensitive to contamination.
Ion pumps do run out as they have a consumable material inside them that reacts
with remaining gas, but they also get you a cleaner vacuum then a diffusion
pump. 
<p>
Ion pumps also act as a gauge by themselves, although not as accurate as a
dedicated gauge. What you want is an appendage ion pump.  They are small and
fast for your purposes, and small enough you can lift them. 
<p>
TPs use a hot titanium filament to bury gas molecules under a thin film of
metal.  The only thing they use up are rods which are presently about $160 for
a lifetime supply. TP are more suited for large vacuum chambers, but they
create a fast clean vacuum and are resistant to an amateur's mistakes.
<p>
The gauges are only about $250 for a new digital one, which is almost cheaper
then buying or scrounging a used ThermoCouple (TC) gauge and these do wear out.
You're better off looking for a digital capacitance manometer then an old beat
up TC.  (Of course I've acquired several complete TC gauges for less than
$50 each complete and put one together for around $25 - the cost of the sensor -
using junk parts. --- Sam)

<h3><A NAME="cvarotv">More on Rotary Vane Mechanical Vacuum Pumps</A></h3>

Rotary vane pumps can be further classified as to the number of stages they
have:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A single stage rotary vane vacuum pump (sometimes called a 'distillation'
 or 'disto' pump based on one common application) can achieve a final vacuum of
 a fraction of a Torr.  This is marginal for some of the lasers we will be
 discussing but if one is available, it is worth trying.  Also see the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacvs5">Salvaged Refrigeration Compressors as
 Vacuum Pumps</A>.
<p>
<li>A two stage rotary vacuum pump has a pair of single stage mechanisms
 mounted on the same drive shaft connected in series.  This is what is
 generally used for 'roughing' the vacuum - as the initial step in achieving
 any of the levels of high vacuums listed above.  Hooking two single stage
 pumps in series can in principle achieve similar performance to a two stage
 pump but this is often not possible in practice.  Pumps with more than two
 stages exist but aren't that common and there comes a point of diminishing
 returns, vacuum-wise. :)

<p>
A well maintained two-stage rotary mechanical pump (the sort of thing you
find in high school physics departments.  OK, perhaps except for the 'well
maintained' part!) can achieve a vacuum of less than 5 milliTorr (5 microns)
if conditions are favorable.  However, with use and age which results mostly 
in oil contamination, even 100 milliTorr may be optimistic.  So, if you find
one of these at a garage sale (as I have), it may be necessary to at least
totally drain the old oil; flush, run, and drain again; and then fill with
fresh vacuum pump oil of the proper type.  Just an oil change without
flushing isn't quite as good but may achieve adequate performance for a
pump that hasn't been abused.  Proper rotary vane vacuum pump oil is
available from vacuum, scientific, and laboratory supply houses as well
as from refrigeration service companies.  No, motor oil or 3-In-One won't
do!  Refrigeration service pump oil isn't what you want
for a true high vacuum but is good as a flush and is certainly adequate for
the CO2 and N2 lasers.  It may even be available from a place like Pep Boys
at all of $10 for a gallon!  (But real vacuum pump oil is also available for
about $10 to $15 per gallon from some suppliers like
<A HREF="http://www.duniway.com/">Duniway Supply</A>.)  Flushing the
pump and replacing its oil may be the single most important thing to achieve
acceptable performance.  Unless the pump was abused, it will probably be
all that is needed.
<p>
See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvarvpm">Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump
Mainenance</A> for more details on reviving a pump that doesn't pump
very well. :)
<p>
Moisture is also a killer of oil, so using such a pump as a wet-dry vac
isn't a good idea either!  A "gas ballast" capability is a feature common
to many rotary vane vacuum pumps.  (The actual technical term is "vented
exhaust valve" but "gas ballast" is what is most often found in vacuum pump
descriptions.)  Whatever it's called, the purpose is to introduce atmospheric
pressure air into the outlet gas stream to dilute any water vapor and reduce
the amount that gets dissolved back into the oil.  However, the gas ballasting
usually increases the base (lowest) pressure attainable by up to a factor
of 10 or more depending on design so where there is an option (usually an
adjustable valve), it should only be used near the beginning of a pump-down
cycle and then disabled (closed).  The gas ballast can also be used to help
purge the oil of dissolved vapors since air bubbling through the oil will
tend to pick up dissolved stuff.  For most home-built lasers, this isn't
an issue since there shouldn't be much water vapor to evacuate and having
no gas ballast will be just fine.  However, some pumps (usually HVAC types)
don't provide the option of disabling the gas ballast (though there are
usually ways around this).  A gas ballast that is always enabled may limit
high vacuum performance since as noted it can increase the lowest attainable
pressure.
<p>
Small high quality rotary vane pumps may cost $1,000 or more new, perhaps $500
used but it's quite possible to find them even cheaper from auctions and other
sources.  See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacvs12">Sources for Vacuum
Equipment and Supplies</A>.
<p>
CAUTION: Many of these pumps <b>DO NOT</b> provide an automatic means of
preventing pump oil from being sucked back into the evacuated part of the
system after the pump is shut off.  Unless the instructions for your pump
explicitly state that a "safety valve" or "automatic vent valve" or something
similar is provided - and it is known to be operating correctly - the system
must be isolated or vented manually to prevent the possibility of oil entering
<b>EVERYTHING</b> including the vacuum gauge sensor heads.  This will likely
require a complete tear-down and cleaning to restore reasonable performance.
The vacuum gauges should definitely NOT be powered up if their sensors are
contaminated with oil as they may be damaged resulting in altered calibration
or total destruction.  Pfeiffer rotary vane pumps provide an electrically or
hydraulically actuated safety valve; Welch two-stage pumps are supposed
to be immune but Welch single stage pumps are not (both unconfirmed); and
Precision Scientific pumps may allow much of their oil to enter the system.
Don't ask me how I found out. :(

<h3><A NAME="cvarhsp">Refrigeration (HVAC) Service Pumps</A></h3>

An alternative which for light duty use may be just as good for our purposes
is the type of pump used by the refrigeration (HVAC) service industry.  Some
of these go for around $350 new and much less used.  And, they usually come
with a convenient carrying handle. :)  In fact, in some cases, that handle
is the main difference between a lab pump and HVAC service pump from the
same manufacturer.  However, there are a few things to look out for with
these pumps:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The base (lowest) pressure specifications for HVAC service pumps
 may not be quite as good as similar lab-type pumps.  Thus, it's important
 to check the specs and/or test the pump before purchase.
<p>
<li>Most HVAC service pumps have some sort of gas ballast capability to help
 purge water vapor and other contaminants from the system.  For applications
 where the base pressure needs to be as low as possible, it's important
 that there be a way of disabling the gas ballast.  Usually, there is an
 adjustable valve or multiple position selector (e.g., off, low, high) but
 some pumps may have the gas ballast enabled all the time.  Though it can
 usually be disabled by blocking some opening or another more creative means,
 it's better not to be bothered doing this.
<p>
<li>Some HVAC service pumps are not rated for continuous duty which would
 make them unsatisfactory for use with home-built lasers.  These should be
 avoided.
<p>
<li>Used HVAC service pumps may have been abused so checking before purchasing
 by measuring the ultimate vacuum with a calibrated gauge is essential.  If
 it's way above the spec'd value, change the oil or have the seller change the
 oil and check again.  If that doesn't help enough, find another pump.
</ul>
<p>
If you do pick up one of these used with original oil, replacing the oil
should greatly improve its performance as all sorts of contamination can be
sucked in when used to evacuate refrigeration systems and there was probably
little or no maintenance ever performed on the pump itself!
<p>
Note that for no justifiable reason, HVAC service pumps tend to have really
narrow inlet fittings and these should be replaced to achieve best performance
for general vacuum work.  This is easily accomplished if they use standard
pipe threads.  If not, some improvisation will be needed.  I replaced the
fitting on my Precision Scientific D25 look-alike which had been used for
HVAC service and had a very narrow screw-on hose connector.  While the
original fitting <i>was</i> very convenient since no tools were required to
change hoses, the hoses were also very narrow - about 3/16" ID - and were
so contaminated with who-knows-what or leaked or something that pulling any
sort of decent vacuum wasn't possible anyhow.  The replacement was a brass
5/8" HB x 1/2" MPT hose barb - about $2 at the local hardware store.  (For
most home-built lasers, this modification really isn't essential since the
required flow rates are generally not that great but it won't hurt and then
you'll be all set for the future.)

<h3><A NAME="cvawelch">Specifications of Welch Rotary Mechanical Vacuum
 Pumps</A></h3>

<A HREF="http://www.welchvacuum.com/">Welch Vacuum</A> (or "Welch" for short)
vacuum pumps are one of the most popular brands - at least to me from my
cyclotron days at my high school!  (See the section:
<A HREF="lasercon.htm#concyc">The Central High School Cyclotron</A>.)
Welch used to be "Sargent-Welch" and has been in the vacuum business since
1880 - over 120 years!  (I may use the two names interchangeably.
However, the current <A HREF="http://www.sargentwelch.com/">Sargent-Welch</A>
company deals only in science education supplies and furniture.)  Welch vacuum
pumps show up on eBay, in high school and college physics labs, in scientific
and engineering research and production facilities, in use and in the storage
of neon sign shops, inside commercial flowing gas CO2 lasers, in (bad) Sci-Fi
movies, and many other places.
<p>
The specifications below are for Welch's belt-drive ("DuoSeal") pumps.  Newer
ones will always have a belt guard (some OSHA requirement I assume) but many
of the older pumps do not.  (Adding a belt guard is definitely advised in any
case unless the pump can be permanently positioned to place the pulley-side
against a wall out of harm's way - yours and the pump's.)  For a given pumping
speed, belt-driven pumps run slower and cooler (which increases reliability and
life expectancy of both the pump and oil) and tend to be quieter than similar
performance direct-drive pumps, but they are larger, heavier, and likely
to vibrate more.  However, should the motor need replacing for some reason
on a belt-drive pump, a standard model from any number of sources or your
junk corner will do.  The motor in direct-drive pumps (which Welch also
manufactures) may only be available from the original supplier, if at all
and installation can be a real treat.  I also don't think direct-drive
pumps have quite the same aesthetic appeal as belt-driven pumps. :)
A testament to Welch's pumps longevity is that these same models
have been around for at least 50 years and probably a lot longer.  And, those
50 year old pumps are still serviceable, requiring at most a cleaning and
relatively inexpensive rebuild kit to meet original factory specifications. 
A photo contact sheet with many of these pumps is shown in
<A HREF="wvpumps1.jpg">Some Welch Belt-Drive Rotary Vane Vacuum
Pumps</A>.  These photos are prettier than the ones on the Welch Web site
and I believe the captions match the pump which wasn't the case the last
time I checked there. :)
<p>
Here is a chart of the most important specs for a variety of Welch belt-drive
rotary vane vacuum pumps.  More detailed specifications for these as well as
Welch's direct drive pumps may be found on the
<A HREF="http://www.welchvacuum.com/">Welch Vacuum</A> Web site.  They also

<p>
<b>Notes</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The "Pumping Speed" values used here are the manufacturer's free air
 displacement ratings.  Actual performance may be slightly lower.
 The specs for the 1405 on Welch's Web site show 3.1 cfm (91 l/m) but I
 list those I've seen everywhere else.  (Newer 1405s are externally similar
 to 1402s with the large oil case but older versions have a very small oil
 reservoir above the pump chambers and no other oil case.  The difference
 in pumping speed may correlate with the version change.  It's not possible
 to tell from the exploded diagrams because the one for the newer 1405 is
 100 percent identical to the diagram for the 1402, which is clearly
 incorrect at least in terms of the sizes of certain parts.)
<p>
<li>The specifications for "Ultimate Vacuum", especially for two stage pumps,
 are generally overly optimistic and not achievable in practice except under
 the most controlled conditions with the pumps in perfect mechanical condition,
 new from the factory or after several flushes, and filled with special low
 vapor pressure oil.  (The vapor pressure at 25 &deg;C for Welch Duo-Seal oil
 is about 5 times the listed base pressure for two-stage Welch pumps!)
 Typical performance with fresh belt-drive pump oil will be a fraction of
 a Torr for single-stage pumps and a few microns for two-stage pumps.  I've
 measured less than 0.04 Torr for a 1399 (single-stage) with new oil after
 flushing and under 2 microns for a 1402 (two-stage) with new oil but without
 flushing.  However, I do believe that both these pumps would benefit from
 another oil change and flushing might help the 1402 even more.  I still
 doubt they would reach spec'd pressure though I have seen another pump
 (Ulvac Sinku-Kiko G-50D) come in well under its more conservative rated
 base pressure of 0.75 microns after a flushing and two oil changes.
<p>
<li>The single-stage 1406, and two-stage 1404, 1375, and larger pumps are
 not listed on Welch's Web site and are presumably no longer in production but
 may be available from surplus and rebuilding companies.  The 1373 only shows
 up in the "Parts Diagrams" portion of the Web site but without specs.
 Various older belt-driven Welch models appear from time-to-time on eBay and
 elsewhere but listed information for them - including what I have above for
 pumping speed and even the number of stages - may not be reliable.  For
 example, I've seen a photo of what was supposedly a 1406 but it had two
 stages - maybe it was mislabeled.  If you are considering the acquisition
 of one of these pumps, double check the specifications.  Even some of the
 info on Welch's Web site is not accurate including a few mislabled photos and
 part diagrams.  However, an eBay listing for a Welch vacuum pump manual
 shows the 1373, 1380, 1399, 1403, 1404, and 1410 to be single-stage pumps; and
 the 1374, 1375, 1376, 1392, 1395, 1396, 1397, 1398, 1400, 1402, and 1405 to
 be two-stage pumps so maybe that can be trusted if it was copied accurately
 (except that the 1406 isn't included).
<p>
<li>Sometimes, especially with older pumps, there is no model number listed
 on the nameplate, just "Welch Duo Seal Vacuum Pump" (or something similar).
 In these cases, if the model isn't obvious from the photos, check for a
 number molded into the cast iron.
<p>
<li>Even the smallest of these pumps would be more than adequate for most
 home-built lasers.  (The typical commercial flowing gas 50 W-class CO2
 laser used a Welch 1399.)  The 1402 (and 1380) are really total overkill
 in terms of pumping speed but the 1402 tends to turn up surplus quite
 frequently so a good deal on one in decent condition shouldn't be passed
 up unless you don't have someone to help drag it home!  Anything larger
 than a 1402 is just plain silly for use with home-built lasers.  And the
 1402 isn't exactly small, weighing in at over 100 pounds!  I have listed
 the big ones here so you will know not to get too excited about those models
 should you find them in a catalog or auction unless, of course, you just
 want to have the biggest pump on your block! :)
<p>
<li>Each of these pumps is available in several versions depending on factors
 like the ability to handle corrosive gases - any will be fine for gas lasers
 (except excimers!).  Given the choice between a single-stage or two-stage
 pump with otherwise similar specs, get the two-stage model as it should be
 able to deal with all of the home-built lasers without requiring a diffusion
 or turbo pump if it is in good condition.  If all you care about are the
 N2 and/or CO2 lasers, a single-stage pump will more than adequate.
<p>
<li>Single-stage and two-stage Welch pumps should not be run continuously with
 inlet pressures above 50 and 10 Torr, respectively.  This really shouldn't be
 a problem when used for home-built lasers since there will be a metering
 valve between the pump and laser tube.  Even for the CO2 laser with the
 smallest pump, the inlet pressure should be quite low.  But, don't let the
 pump run for hours with nothing connected just because you like the way it
 gurgles. :)
<p>
<li>If some of these pumps are idle for a long time, especially with the inlet
 left at vacuum when powered down, the first couple rotations could then have
 tough spots resulting in a stalled motor or smoking slip clutch (if present)
 the next time it is started.  One cause is that if there is no relief valve
 between stages (or it is stuck or clogged), when incompressible oil fills
 the pump chambers, the only place for it to go when the pump is started is
 through the microscopic gaps between moving parts.  Even within each pump
 chamber, there may be a portion of the cycle where the trapped space is
 decreasing in volume with no outlet for incompressible oil.  Another
 possibility that has been reported is that this behavior is due to many years
 of accumulated gunk on the walls of the pump chambers.  I've encountered the
 tough spot syndrome on more than one Welch pump as well as my Precision
 Scientific D25 lookalike.  Since they all operate with decent performance
 otherwise, it's not worth losing sleep over.  Where this situation is found
 to be the case with your pump, rotating the pulley through a few cycles first
 by hand is a good idea to reduce starting stress on the motor and/or slip
 clutch.  Venting the inlet (vacuum) side of the system to air after use
 should also reduce or elminate the problem.  I assume that pumps with
 belt guards are designed in a way that avoids this problem under all
 conditions.

The following applies to the Uno/Duo 1.5A, 2.5A, 005A, and other

of pump shutdown due to overheating.  In this case, five wires (including
Earth Ground) will probably attach the motor to the controller.
<p>
Where the pump is to be used by itself, the terminal blocks should be wired

<h3><A NAME="cvarvpm">Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump Maintenance</A></h3>

So, you picked up a fabulous Sargent-Welch two-stage pump at a garage sale
for $5 but are now wondering whether it was worth the price and (grunt!)
effort to get it home since it won't even suck the air out of a paper bag!
OK, this is perhaps a slight exaggeration. :)  However, if the pump won't
get anywhere near the vacuum expected (less than a Torr for a single stage pump
or a few microns for a two stage pump is realistic even if this is not quite
as good as what the manufacturer's specs may call for), all it may need is a
little tender loving care.  OK, maybe a lot of tender loving care and possibly
a few selected chants and some four letter words! :)
<p>
Assuming there are no external leaks, the short list of causes for poor vacuum
performance are old/dirty/contaminated oil, low or no oil, open or defective
gas ballast valve, sticking internal parts due to buildup of insoluble
varnish/gum on pump chamber or valves, and then finally, damaged internal
parts.

<h4><A NAME="cvacoup">Checking Out a Used Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A></h4>

WARNING: Confirm that any second-hand pump hasn't been used with hazardous
or toxic materials without having been decontaminated.  If it has, the
services of a HASMAT/DETOX center will be required - that's not something
you should do in your basement.  A thorough external cleaning, and a couple
of flushings and an oil change should get rid of most of it but how will
you know how much remains?
<p>
CAUTION: Make sure that your pump has the correct amount of oil before
attempting to run it!  Else it may only be good for a boat anchor.  There are
some so-called "dry" vacuum pumps but these are not that common.
<p>
Here is a basic guide to the "processing" of a new old pump:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Initial disassembly:</b> Remove all external accessories like an oil
 mist separator, vacuum hose and other plumbing, vacuum gauges, etc.  Set
 these aside for cleaning, inspection, repair, or disposal as required.
 Temporarily plug the inlet and outlet with lint-free rags or wads of paper
 towel to prevent the entrance of dirt.
<p>
<li><b>Cleaning:</b> Take a damp rag and wipe everything off - multiple times
 if necessary - to remove the layers of oil and grease.  Then, maybe a damp
 rag with a little detergent to remove the residue.  Use a soft brush to
 remove any dust, cobwebs, and other debris from around any cooling fins and
 the motor vent holes.  Not only will your pump be more presentable, cleaning
 will also reveal potential problem areas like a leaking shaft seal or sump
 gasket.  And, subsequent maintenance will be less messy.  If you want to
 touch up the paint or refinish the pump in decorator colors (use high
 temperature enamel as these pumps - especially the direct-drive variety -
 get quite hot after running for a few hours), that's optional, but just
 a clean pump will be a happy pump. :)
<p>
<li><b>General inspection:</b> Look for signs of obvious damage or problems
 that will have to be dealt with before the pump is used.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>For belt-drive pumps, inspect the belt for oil soaking or excessive wear
  and replace if needed.  These are usually standard 1/2" V-belts available
  from an appliance or auto parts store.  Check/correct the alignment of the
  pulleys and tighten the setscrews.  If there is a centrifugal clutch on the
  motor, disassemble and clean it, and check for excessive wear.  Replacement
  with a normal pulley is probably acceptable as long as the pump is switched
  on manually and there is someone to recognize a locked rotor. :)  Rotate the
  pump pulley by hand in the proper direction and check for any unusual noises
  or obvious mechanical problems like it being frozen solid into a congealed
  pile of rust. :)  There may be various squishing and gurgling
  sounds but nothing like rocks knocking against metal parts.  The first few
  revolutions may have tough spots due to oil trapped in the pump chambers
  and/or varnish/gum on pump chamber walls and valves.  (Where the
  inlet and outlet are offset, the proper direction will be where the edge of
  the pulley moves in the same direction as the airflow through the pump.  It
  <i>should</i> also be the direction that results in slack on the top of the
  belt and tension on the bottom (though this rule may not always be followed,
  even by the manufacturer).  Or, the direction that produces suction from
  the inlet!)
<p>
 <li>Look for signs of oil leaks indicating the need for shaft seal replacement
  or other maintenance.  For belt-drive pumps, the shaft seal will be readily
  visible behind the large pulley or inside the pump at that location.  (See
  the section below for a typical shaft seal replacement procedure.)  For
  direct-drive pumps, the only evidence of a problem may be oil dripping out
  the bottom vent holes in the motor!
<p>
  Shaft seal replacement on some belt-driven pumps (like Welch) can be
  performed without major disassembly but on others (like Precision
  Scientific), it requires removal of the pump assembly from the case.
  Shaft seal replacement on direct-drive pumps is almost always more involved
  and may require total disassembly.
<p>
 <li>Check the power cord and switch (if present).  The cord should not be
  frayed or brittle and should be an adequately rated 3 wire type.  If the
  pump doesn't have a 3 wire grounded plug, replace with a heavy duty cordset
  (#16 AWG or larger wire) attached directly to the motor or terminal block.
  If someone cut off the third prong of the plug but everything else is
  in good condition, just replace the plug.  Make sure the motor is wired for
  the correct voltage (probably 115 VAC in the USA though running larger
  pumps on 230 VAC if possible will reduce the required wire size).  The types
  of motors used in vacuum pumps often can be wired for either 115 VAC or 230
  VAC, sometimes with taps for slightly low or high line voltage as well.  A
  regular snap-action wall switch mounted in an electrical utility box is
  better than the cord-mounted variety that often comes with these pumps.
<p>
<li>Check the gas ballast valve (if any).  Unscrew it, check the seating
  surfaces, clean, reinstall, and gently close it.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Check the condition of the existing oil, if any.  Clear, light color
 oil close to at least the minimum level in the sight glass is a good sign
 that the pump hasn't been totally neglected.  Oil color varies with type
 but should generally be closer to that of new automotive or gear oil, or
 honey but not molasses.  Dark oil that looks more like day old black coffee
 probably indicates that the pump was run long and hot way beyond when the
 oil should have been changed.  Where the coffee grounds (rust particles)
 are also present, serious internal damage may have already occurred.
<p>
<li>If there is a full charge of oil in the pump and it isn't in terrible
 condition, install a vacuum-tight cap on the inlet and run the pump for
 long enough to determine that it doesn't make any terrible noises or
 explode. :)  If there is insufficient oil, either add some (it can be
 used oil in decent condition) or drain the oil completely and replace
 with fresh oil as described below.  The sounds will change as the air
 is removed from the capped inlet including gurgling, throbbing, clicking,
 and clacking depending on the particular pump.  Some are almost silent
 near their ultimate vacuum while others definitely are not!
<p>
<li>For initial vacuum tests, attach a vacuum gauge to the inlet via a short
 length of vacuum hose or whatever works. :)  Make sure the gas ballast valve
 (if present) is fully closed.  A Bourdon tube vacuum gauge should go down to
 near its lower limit (e.g., 30 inches of mercury) almost instantly and stay
 there.  (The exact value will vary depending on local barometric pressure
 though.)  A thermocouple or similar gauge should indicate less than 5 Torr
 after a few seconds of operation even with very bad oil.  For oil that is in
 half decent condition, the ultimate vacuum after several minutes
 should be less than 1 Torr and 25 microns for single-stage and two-stage
 pumps, respectively (and may be much better) with the gas ballast valve
 fully closed.
<p>
<li>If the pump is filled with old oil or oil in unknown condition, and it
 has a gas ballast valve, open it to the point where the sound changes to a
 distinct gurgling or the gauge indicates a pressure 5 or 10 times what it
 was before.  (Single stage pumps only; unless the pressure is very near a
 two stage pump's limit, there will probably be little if any change in
 pressure with the gas ballast valve upen.)  Remove any exhaust filter
 that might impede free flow of vapor out of the pump.  If there is
 significant oil misting at the exhaust so place a container there
 to catch it.  Let the pump run like this for a few minutes and then
 close the gas ballast valve.  If dissolved water vapor or other
 volatile gases were limiting the base pressure, it should now have
 improved somewhere between slightly and dramatically.  The pump can be run
 with the gas ballast partially open for a while to attempt to purge the oil
 or just bite the bullet and change the oil now.
</ol>
<p>
A thermocouple, thermistor, Pirani, or other vacuum gauge which covers the
operating range of your vacuum pump(s) will be highly desirable to determine
the performance once the basic condition of the pump has been evaluated.
Of the Hastings TC gauge tubes, the DV-3 or DV-6, and DV-5 or DV-8 are
perfect for testing one and two stage mechanical vacuum pumps, respectively.
The lower limits of their "best sensitivity ranges" go down to the pressures
listed in the specifications for these pumps and the most accurate portion of
the gauge response curves are where the realistic operating points will be
located.  Connect the gauge tube to the pump with a short length of new
vacuum hose or metal plumbing - old tubing may be so full of trapped gases
that it will take forever to get a decent vacuum.
<p>
If your pump didn't come with an exhaust oil mist separator (a thing that
looks like a small engine air filter) attached to the outlet port, consider
obtaining or building one, especially if you won't be pumping against a
high vacuum with the gas ballast valve (if present) closed most of the time
(the gas passing through pump is the major cause of misting).  An alternative
is to simply run the exhaust through a hose to the outside.  Oil mist will
eventually get over everything, is potentially flammable, and may be a
health hazard.  However, from my experience, oil misting from Welch
belt-driven pumps is minimal - just having the plastic cover from an aerosol
spray can covering the outlet port (or that dome thing that comes with
Welch pumps) really traps most of it.

<h4><A NAME="cvaprvp">Things to Check for Poor Rotary Vane Pump
 Performance</A></h4>

The following applies to rotary vane pumps used for low to medium vacuum
applications.  For pressures below 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr and/or where other
pumps are used, there will be many additional considerations.
<p>
The first thing to do is isolate the problem to the pump or everything else.
Connect the vacuum gauge sensor directly to the pump with a short length of
vacuum-rated hose and see how far down it will go.  (Many types of hose are
really not vacuum-tight even though they may be fine for liquids or air under
pressure.  I had some rubber hose that appeared to be quite good but when
stretched or even when axle grease was smeared on the outside - volatile
solvents? - the pressure would go up.)  Threaded connections are also a
potential source of internal leaks from between the threads even if they
seal perfectly.  As long as the pressure is generally decreasing, be patient
and give the pump time to do its work.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gas ballast:</b> Make sure the gas ballast valve (if present) is
 closed.  Sometimes if this hasn't been touched in a long time it will be
 hard to turn or just plain stuck and may appear to be closed when in fact
 it isn't.  If the pump makes a gurgling or throbbing sound or there is
 significant oil misting at the exhaust port even when running with the
 inlet capped, the gas ballast may be open or broken (or there may be other
 mechanical problems like a broken or stuck exhaust valve).  Note that some
 pumps (usually HVAC/refrigeration service types) don't provide a convenient
 (or documented) way of disabling the gas ballast but there may be an opening
 that can be blocked or output valve that can be modified.
<p>
<li><b>Pump oil problems:</b> Old, dirty, contaminated, or incorrect type of
 oil is the most common cause of performance not meeting expectations with
 rotary vane vacuum pumps.  Unless the oil is known to be in good condition,
 change it.  If the type of oil in the pump is unknown, change it (who knows
 if the previous owner used salad dressing to top off the oil level!).  Running
 the pump with flushing oil before refilling with the <i>proper</i> type of
 oil is recommended for best results but just completely draining the old oil
 and refilling with new oil will work wonders.  Several oil changes, each
 with fresh oil running for awhile in between, may be needed for the pump
 to approach its rated base pressure (assuming it's in good condition
 otherwise) since it's not possible to purge all
 the used oil from the pump without totally disassembling it.  Using oil
 intended for belt-drive pumps in direct-drive pumps may result in a higher
 than expected base pressure due to its greater vapor pressure.  This will
 also probably result in shortened oil and pump life in the long term due
 to its higher viscosity and the higher temperature at which these pumps
 operate.  Also, too little oil can result in frothing and mediocre
 performance.  Too much oil is not desirable either and may result
 in oil being expelled out of the exhaust port.  A level between 1/2
 and 3/4 on the sight glass <i>while running</i> is usually safe but
 each pump has its own requirements which may be printed on a plate
 attached to the pump
<p>
 Where the pressure bottoms out and then gradually increases significantly
 as the pump gets hot, the cause is usually outgassing of the pump oil
 indicating the need for an oil change.  Running for several hours with
 the gas ballast open for part of that time may clear dissolved gases
 from the old oil and result in a significant improvement or at least
 confirm that dirty oil is part of the problem.  This is even useful after
 an oil change since there is never any way to get rid of all the old
 oil unless the pump is totally disassembled.  Let the pump run hot
 (don't add any cooling fan that isn't part of the pump) as this
 will help the oil to outgas.  Make sure the exhaust port is not obstructed
 so the gases can escape - remove any oil mist filter or extra pipe.
 The vapor pressure of all pump oils increases with temperature but 
 might result in a pressure rise of at most 1 or 2 microns,
 not 25 microns!  A small fan blowing on the pump case to cool the oil
 will also help but shouldn't make that much difference once there has
 been an oil change (or several) with the proper oil and the new oil has had a
 chance to outgas while running hot.  If there's still a large pressure
 increase as the pump heats up, change the oil again!
<p>
 The following chart shows the results of replacing old tired oil with new
 oil for several pumps:

<p>
 <b>Notes:</b>
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>Process: F=Flush, R=Replace.  Flush means draining the old oil and
  running the pump with flushing fluid until hot (at least 1 hour).  Replace
  means draining the oil completely (including running the pump for a few
  seconds with an open inlet to clear the pump chambers of oil) and then
  adding new oil of the proper type (except, see the notes on the double
  replacement of oil in the Ulvac G-50D and Pfeiffer 1.5A #1, below).
<p>
 <li>"Hot" means running under ambient conditions without cooling.  All
  these pumps have a significant temperature rise after operating for an hour
  or more (least is the 1399; greatest is the Duo 1.5A).  "Cooled"
  means using a small fan to blow air over the pump casing to keep the pump
  and oil nearer ambient temperature.  I'm not sure why the 1399 has such a
  large change in pressure between hot and cooled unless it's still
  very filthy inside - which is quite possible.  However, note that
  it's not needed or desirable to cool the pump simply as a way of
  reducing the base pressure until the oil has had time to outgas
  as much as possible while running hot.  This can be several hours to
  several days or more.
<p>
 <li>Pressure measurements were made with calibrated Hastings VT-4, VT-5 or
  VT-8, and/or VT-6 thermocouple vacuum gauges depending on the pressure range.
  Calibration was either with respect to a Hastings TC reference tube, or a
  high vacuum (0.00 Torr) reference from a turbo pump.
<p>
 <li>For the Ulvac G-50D, there was no original oil since the pump was empty
  when I acquired it.  However, initial testing was done with used but
  reasonably clean oil so that's what is shown.
<p>
  After running with flushing fluid for a few hours, this was replaced with
  with new belt-drive oil (Precision Plus Plus Duo) and run for a few hours.
  This was then replaced with new direct-drive pump oil (Precision Plus
  Plus 19).  The incredibly low base pressure - less than one half of the
  spec'd value - is not a typo.  Before the second oil change, the base
  pressure (cooled) was 1.4 microns.  The only reason I used belt drive oil for
  the first oil change was that it is cheaper. :)  I don't think most of
  the difference in vacuum performance was due to the type of oil but rather
  the second oil change eliminated more of the original contaminated oil
  residue.  Most of the other pumps should benefit from at least one
  additional oil change as well.  And, of course, flushing for the 1402s.
<p>
 <li>For Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A #1, the first oil replacement was with some
  old direct drive oil I had laying around.  It didn't help very much.
  The subsequent oil changes were Plus Duo followed by Plus 19, just
  like the Ulvac, above.
<p>
 <li>For Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A #2, the small difference between the
  pressure with the hot and cooled original oil suggests that the oil is
  the correct type and in good condition, quite possibly new.  (This pump
  was shipped to me without draining the oil and miraculously didn't make
  too much of a mess in the box!)  Since the base pressures of both Duo 1.5As
  are similar, this further suggests that they are both operating near
  their actual achievable ratings.  The specifications in the manual are
  somewhat confusing but the one that seems to apply is around 5 microns
  (listed as 6.6 mBar).
 </ol>
<p>
<li><b>Vanes (or other parts) sticking:</b> Varnish and gum that have
 collected on the surfaces of internal parts can result in sluggish or no
 movement of the vanes in and out from the rotor (they will just tend to
 stick at the "in" position and not make solid contact with the pump chamber)
 or of internal check valves and the like.  Behavior may be erratic or clear
 up after the pump heats up.  A flushing or two should take care of sticking
 problems.  A broken vane return spring or other mechanical problem could also
 be at fault.
</ul>
<p>
Problems due to damaged internal parts are fairly far down on the list though
as I've found out, reed valve reeds can break due to unknown causes,
corrosion possibly from water-logged oil being one.  Of course, if the
pump has ingested enough debris, the vanes could be nicked or chipped
along with scoring of the cylinder walls.  It would be possible to
replace or regrind the vanes and rebore the cylinder but that's for the
advanced course.  Pumps used in high vacuum (scientific and industrial)
applications are much less likely to suffer from such damage.  On the
other hand, they tend to be run continuously, possibly for years, and thus
may be worn out in other ways.  However, note that one common fault with
older pumps - a leaking shaft seal - may make a mess but will generally
not affect vacuum performance.
<p>
Once the pump is eliminated as the source of the problem, there must be either
leaks or contamination in the rest of the system:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Leaks:</b> Make sure what you are attempting to evacuate is properly
 sealed.  Even at these relatively modest pressures, it doesn't take much to
 dramatically affect the base pressure.
<p>
<li><b>System contamination:</b> Solvents, fingerprints, non-vacuum rated
 grease, and other materials can outgas for days even at a relatively modest
 vacuum.  Make sure the vacuum piping and vessel(s) are immaculate!
<p>
 Running for a few hours or days will eventually clear out volatile
 contaminants but proper cleaning in the first place is much preferred.
 Proper cleaning means using appropriate solvents in a well ventilated area
 that evaporate without residue and without mixing them with the oil.  Else,
 it will take forever to get a decent vacuum after reassembly.  DON'T use
 WD40 or similar products for anything remotely involved in a high vacuum
 system!  They leave residue behind by design. :)
</ul>
<p>
And before going to extremes in attempting to achieve a perfect vacuum,
consider your application.  If it's for the N2 or CO2 laser, a base pressure
of 1 Torr is really more than just fine.  Almost any pump in decent
mechanical condition will achieve 1 Torr - possibly even if it is filled
with used salad oil. :)
<p>
But a comment about using automotive and other non-vacuum pump oil: It's
not so much that the ultimate vacuum may be mediocre.  It may in fact
be quite adequate for some of the home-built lasers.  However, there
can be issues of eventual damage to the pump if the viscosity is too low
or too high or the oil contains additives.  The oil may also deteriorate
rather quickly.  Proper vacuum pump oil isn't expensive - go for it! :)

<h4><A NAME="cvaoilc">Changing the Oil in a Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A></h4>

An oil change is the single most important type maintenance beyond what's
been described above that can be performed on a rotary vacuum pump.   It is
certainly the easiest and likely to be all that is required to achieve an
acceptable level of performance.  Unless the oil in your pump is known to
be new or nearly new and uncontaminated, replacing it now could save countless
hours of grief in attempting to achieve a decent vacuum prevented from doing
so due to back-streaming of dissolved contaminants in the oil - NOT horrible
mechanical problems requiring a complete rebuild.  In addition, contaminated
oil - which often contains moisture - can result in corrosion and ultimately,
destruction of internal pump parts if it remains in the pump for an extended
period of time.
<p>
Pumps with no large oil case (like the older version of the Welch 1405 and
similar models where the outer surface of the pump chambers is exposed) have
very small oil capacities.  Oil contamination and degradation with use will
occur much more quickly compared to similar capacity pumps with huge oil
reservoirs, especially when run hot and long and with substances that dissolve
in the oil.  Thus, frequent oil changes are essential with these pumps both to
maintain performance and to achieve long life.  At least the amount of oil
needed is small. :)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the proper type of vacuum pump oil - NOT the stuff you put in your
 car's engine or on your vegetable salad!  There are specific viscosities
 and formulations for belt-drive and direct-drive pumps.  Using the wrong
 type (belt-drive versus direct drive) probably won't cause any immediate
 harm but may reduce oil and pump life if used long-term and generally
 won't result in the lowest base pressure.  Genuine original manufacturer
 pump oils aren't needed.  The generic oils like those from
 <A HREF="http://www.duniway.com/">Doniway Supply</A> are fine and only
 1/4 to 1/2 the price.  And, you don't need the most expensive oil in
 each category.  The basic belt-drive oil and direct-drive oil are really
 just fine.  From Duniway, these are about $10.00 and $15 a gallon for
 belt-drive and direct-drive pump oil, respectively.
<p>
 I won't mention the time back in high school when we would top off the
 Welch pump for our cyclotron with refrigeraton compressor oil that the
 chiller service people had left behind.  Actually, it worked remarkably well.
 Cyclotron in high school you say? :)  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercon.htm#concyc">The Central High School Cyclotron</A>.
<p>
<li>If the original oil was in really dreadful condition - it looked more
 like day old coffee than oil, or the pump would not achieve a pressure
 anywhere on the charts, one or more flushings with special flushing oil
 is recommended.  See the comments below with respect to "flushing oil".
 The following assumes a simple oil change.
<p>
<li>Oil is best changed when warm - after the pump has been run for awhile.
 This reduces its viscosity permitting more of the old oil to be removed.
 Clearly, if your pump currently doesn't have any oil, this isn't an
 option.  If the oil is in totally dreadful condition or you don't know
 if it is really oil, then just drain it cold.  Otherwise, run the pump for a
 half hour or so dead-headed (with the inlet capped) to warm up the oil.
<p>
<li>Remove anything attached to the vacuum (inlet) or at least make sure it
 is open to the atmosphere.  The exhaust port and/or oil fill pipe may need
 to be open to act as a vent for the draining oil.  Or, if capped, rotating
 the pump by hand or by motor may help force the oil out quicker.  However,
 using the motor may result in oil all over <i>everything</i> so this is not
 recommended except as noted below.
<p>
<li>Open the sump valve or remove the plug and drain the oil into a plastic
 container with a tight fitting cap.  After the oil stops flowing on its own,
 rotate the pump pulley by hand or power the pump for a few seconds to clear
 the pump chambers of oil.  Tip the pump toward the drain to help it along.
 Be patient for the oil to drain - the less old oil remains, the less of its
 problems will remain!
<p>
<li>If the old oil isn't in totally terrible condition, it may be useful for
 initial testing of other pumps in which case, make that a clean plastic
 container. :)  Aside from obvious debris in the oil, compare the color of
 the old and new oils - if the old oil is much darker, don't use it for
 anything and dispose of it in an environmentally friendly manner.
<p>
<li>Close the sump valve or replace the plug!  Make sure the pump is on
 a level surface.
<p>
<li>Fill the pump with new oil up to the lower limit of the "acceptable range"
 of the sight glass.  With the inlet capped, start the pump and top off the
 oil if necessary to the upper limit.  If it goes too high, open the drain
 valve and lower it to the upper limit.  Assume that the acceptable range is
 1/2 to 3/4 on the sight glass if not marked.
<p>
<li>Reconnect the vacuum lines along with a vacuum gauge capable of
 measuring at the expected pressure range (e.g., thermocouple, Pirani, or
 capacitance manometer).  Start up the pump and check for leaks.  When
 first run with newly replaced oil, the pressure may fluctuate on the
 way down and take awhile to reach the base pressure as air bubbles
 and trapped vapors are purged from the oil.
</ol>
<p>
With a combination of its original oil (what remained after the rest was lost
due to a leaky shaft seal which has since been replaced) and old oil from my
Precision Scientific D25 look-alike, my first Welch 1402 would reach 3.5
microns when cold but then creep up past 10 microns after running for awhile
as the oil got hot and the vapor pressure of dissolved crud increased.  I
don't know if simply running it for a few hours or days would have helped but
decided to replace the oil rather than waiting.  After the oil change (but
without flushing), the 1402 goes down to about 2 microns and reaches only 3
microns when hot.  With a small fan blowing on the pump housing for cooling,
it holds down under 2 microns indefinitely.  Flushing and another oil change
would probably get it below 1 micron.

<h4><A NAME="cvaflush">Notes on Flushing of Rotary Vane Mechanical Pumps</A></h4>

Where the original oil looks more like tar than oil, or an oil change doesn't
get down to an acceptable base pressure on a pump that appears in otherwise
good condition, you may need to run the pump with special flushing fluid or
flushing oil (same thing).  This stuff is designed to dissolve accumulated
gunk (technical term!) and other undesirable volatile materials while the pump
is running.  Instead of replacing the oil with the proper pump oil, get
a sufficient quantity of flushing fluid from your vacuum equipment supplier.
It's usually even cheaper than normal oil.
<p>
Perform the oil change procedure as described above but use flushing fluid
instead and fill it to the top of the oil level gauge so as to have the best
chance of also being in contact with anything that may have sloshed up
there.  Then run the pump for several hours with the inlet capped (or
with a gauge if you like to watch the action).  Let it get nice and hot
since that will help the process.  The achievable base pressure with flushing
fluid will already probably be better than what you had before, but not as
good as with normal pump oil.  Multiple flushing cycles may help with really
crudded up pumps. :)
<p>
Note that if you're mechanically inclined and don't mind the mess, it's even
better to also remove the pump cover(s) and clean their interior and all
accessible surfaces by hand.  Since there is little oil movement outside
of the pumping chambers help dissolve the crud, this may result in much
better performance with less flushing time.  It's good idea to have replacement
gaskets available to assure a leak free seal when it goes back together.
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
Go to <A HREF="http://www.duniway.com/">Duniway Stockroom</A> and buy a couple
of gallons of flushing oil and a gallon of vacuum oil.  Drain all the old oil
out, fill with flushing oil and run the pump for a couple of hours deadheaded
(e.g., with the vacuum inlet capped) until it's good and hot.  Drain.  Repeat
until the flushing oil comes out clear.  Fill with regular pump oil and
run for several hours deadheaded until the oil is good and hot.  If you have
a thermocouple vacuum gauge, check the deadheaded vacuum.  A used 1402 or
1405 should achieve 3 to 5 microns after the oil has completely outgassed.
Outgassing might take a day or more.
<p>
If several flushings won't clear the oil or you can't achieve that vacuum,
the pump chambers may need cleaning.
<p>
I also suggest buying Duniway's shaft seal kit.  This kit replaces the
original crappy seal with a modern tensioned rubber seal.  It completely
stops shaft weeping.
<p>
These pumps are so rugged that I believe that the very first one, which
provided vacuum on the Mayflower, is still running. :-)  Everything is
rebuildable.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
Note that I would <b>NOT</b> recommend attempting a complete overhaul of
a vacuum pump unless (1) the performance really isn't acceptable even after
several flushings as described above, and (2) you have experience rebuilding
other similar equipment or at least lawn mower engines with successful
outcomes!  It the pump pulls a vacuum you can live with, leave well enough
alone. :)  However, where the outer cover can be removed without disturbing
the shaft seal, it may be worth the risk (mainly of damaging its gasket) to
be able to clean out the sump from the inside - even repeated oil changes
may not dislodge the very dirty icky oily crud that collects there (though
a couple of flushings should do an adequate job in most cases).  I do highly
recommend having a replacement gasket on hand as the old one is likely brittle
with little resilience so oil leaks are almost a certainty when everything
is reassembled.  If an "official" gasket isn't available (or isn't available
at reasonable cost), make one from a piece of cardboard stock (1/32" or so)
cut to shape with scissors and a utility knife.  That's what they may sell you
in any case and it works well!  In fact, the cardboard variety is easier to
deal with than the rubber foam type which tends to droop and has to be coaxed
into position.
<p>
CAUTION: On pumps where the shaft seal is internal like some Precision
Scientific models, just removing the pump assembly from the case risks
destroying an old shaft seal whose parts have stuck to the shaft.  Replacement
may be expensive or challenging.  There is no guaranteed way to prevent this
type of failure from occurring though running the pump until it's nice and hot
before disassembly might soften things up enough to become unstuck. :)  See the
section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvapsd25">Rehabilitating a Precision Scientific
D25 Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A>.
<p>
(From: Ed Phillips (evp@pacbell.net).)
<p>
I recently replaced the seal in a NIB but never used Welch 1400 pump which had
been sitting in my attic since I bought it new (for about $150 delivered) back
in 1960.  The new seal was around $50 delivered.  Nice little pump.
<p>
I have a couple of 1405's (or is it 1402?  Anyhow, next size up from the 1400)
here which have a note painted on the outside indicating that they were
overhauled back in May, 1954.  They sat around in the back of a CRT rebuilding
shop for many years before I picked them up a few years back.  They still had
a full charge of (very dirty) oil in them.  Fired one up, flushed it out a
couple of times, and refilled with DuoSeal oil.  Using my little old McLeod I
indicate a pressure of around 1 micron after a few hours of running.  (Gauge
connected to the pump through a short section of 1/2" ID rubber tube.)  They
must have many thousands of hours on them since overhaul.  By the way, the
shaft seals don't leak on either pump.

<h4><A NAME="cvarwss">Replacing the Shaft Seal on a Sargent-Welch Rotary Vane
 Vacuum Pump</A></h4>

I had to do this for a Welch 1402 so here's the step-by-step (this may vary
slightly for other Welch models but not by much):
<p>
Order the appropriate shaft seal from
<A HREF="http://www.duniway.com/">Duniway Stockroom</A>.  It's about $25
including shipping which is more than you might think it should cost but
the machined cover into which the actual seal is pressed is probably a
custom made part.  And, this is about 1/3rd of the price direct from Welch!
However, if you can machine your own cover or an adapter for the old cover,
a $2 seal of the appropriate diameter from an auto-parts store should work just
fine.  But you better find an actual part number for a suitable oil seal from
an auto service manual or seal catalog - just asking for a 3/4" diameter oil
seal (or whatever) probably won't be very productive. :)  Or, just the seal
can be purchased from other vacuum suppliers like
<A HREF="http://www.precisionplus.com/">Precision Plus</A>.  They also have
complete seal kits for most Welch pumps at slightly higher prices than
Duniway.
<p>
The item listed as "Shaft Seal" from Duniway actually includes the seal,
gasket, three (3) screws, and instructions, but they are not really as
comprehensive as what follows. :)
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the belt, pump pulley, and Woodruff (half moon) key on the pump
 shaft.  Clean any oil off of the pulleys.  If the belt is oil-soaked or
 excessively worn, it should be replaced.  Note: Both pulleys can be pulled
 off at the same time without the need to move the motor, or just the pump
 pulley and belt can be removed by loosening the motor mount clamps and
 lifting the motor off its cradle.  But don't try to remove only the pump
 pulley with the belt still tight.
<p>
<li>Remove anything attached to the inlet (or at least make sure it is open
 to the atmosphere) and outlet (which will be needed to vent as the old oil
 is drained and for refilling).
<p>
<li>Drain the oil into a clean plastic container with a secure cap (if it's to
 be reused) by unscrewing the plug at the bottom of the pump.  If the oil isn't
 going to be reused, the container doesn't need to be clean. :)  But dispose
 of it in an environmentally friendly manner.  If oil doesn't come gushing out
 immediately when the plug is removed, the rubber sealing gasket may not have
 come off with the plug - just gently pry it out with something pointy.
 The 1402 should contain about two quarts of oil but draining only a quart is
 enough to prevent the shaft from weeping while you are working on it.  Now's
 probably a good time to change the oil if you haven't done it in about
 thousand years. :)  Of course, if your shaft seal is as leaky as mine was,
 it probably already drained a good portion of itself onto the lab floor. :(
 The Duniway instructions recommend tipping the pump on its back at this point
 but I don't really think it is necessary as long as enough oil is drained.
 Not doing this also reduces the possibility of getting debris in the weep
 hole - I'd suggest plugging it up while cleaning the shaft/gasket area in
 any case.
<p>
<li>Remove the 3 screws holding the seal cover in place and remove it and
 the old gasket.  Depending on the original type of seal and how stuck to
 the shaft parts of it are, a small gear puller may be needed to free it
 from the pump.  Everything you remove is to be discarded anyway (unless
 you're installing your own non-Welch seal into the old cover in which case
 it will need to be in good condition and thoroughly cleaned of seal and
 gasket debris) so don't worry about damaging the pieces but take care not
 to scratch or dent the shaft!  Some parts may still be stuck to the shaft.
 On mine, the old seal assembly came apart but there was an aluminum ring
 which had to be freed using pliers in a twisting motion before most of the
 parts of the old shaft seal would come off.  It probably had gummed up oil
 holding it in place.  At this point, only the shaft should be sticking out
 of the main pump casting.
<p>
<li>Inspect the shaft for damage in the vicinity of the pump casting where
 the seal will need to contact the shaft.  Use degreaser to remove any baked
 on oil and other debris.  If this doesn't result in a perfectly smooth
 shaft, it may be necessary to use 600 grit or finer sandpaper followed
 by ultra-fine steel wool, very gently polishing in a direction around
 the shaft, NOT parallel to it.  The shaft doesn't need to be mirror shiny but
 there should be no scratches or dings that will catch a fingernail.  Also
 remove any remaining pieces of the old gasket stuck to the pump so that the
 seating surface is also nice and smooth.
<p>
<li>Inspect the rest of the shaft for damage and carefully sand or file it
 so there are no sharp edges or protrusions to catch the new seal as it is
 slid onto the shaft.  Slightly bevel the end if it isn't already.  Put a
 piece of cellophane "Scotch" tape over the keyway as a precaution.
<p>
<li>Make sure any sandpaper or steel wool particles are removed and take
 special care that they don't make it into the weep hole above the shaft
 that enters the pump.  Use a cotton swab or something similar to remove
 debris from the three seal cover mounting holes.
<p>
<li>Wipe the new seal clean inside and out.  Note that the new seal has two
 sides which differ.  The one with the spring surrounding the rubber lip goes
 toward the pump; the one with the nylon cover goes toward the pulley.
<p>
<li>Add a few drops of pump oil to the area between the two rubber lips.
 (The Duniway instructions warn against putting in more than 5 drops - I'm
 not sure if the Universe explodes if this rule is violated but I wasn't
 about to find out!).
<p>
<li>Slip the new foam gasket onto the shaft.  There is no need to put oil on
 it and do not use any sealer.
<p>
<li>Put a couple drops of oil on the shaft and smear it around.  Carefully
 slide the new seal onto the shaft using a rocking motion.  Remove the Scotch
 tape. :)
<p>
<li>Install the 3 new screws through the holes in the seal cover and gasket
 just so the seal is snug against the pump.
<p>
<li>Check that the seal is centered on the shaft and then tighten the 3 screws
 equally in a rotating pattern in small increments.  Wipe up any spilled oil
 on the pump and base.
<p>
<li>Replace the shaft key(s), pulleys, and belt.  Make sure the two pulleys
 line up!  Check the belt tension - it should deflect about 1/2 inch
 when pressed midway between the pulleys.  Adjust it if necessary by changing
 the motor position.
<p>
<li>Let the seal set in for at least 1/2 hour to allow it to conform to the
 shaft.  Duniway doesn't say this but I've read it from other suppliers who
 warn of early failure if the pump is run immediately.  It probably doesn't
 matter but what's your hurry? :)
<p>
<li>Replace or add new oil.  DON'T FORGET THIS STEP!!!!  Note: The oil level
 on these pumps needs to be between the two marks in the windows when the
 pump is running.  When stopped, the pump chambers may fill up with oil and
 the level will be somewhat lower.  So, add oil only until the level is at the
 bottom of the window.  Top it off only after the pump is running.
<p>
<li>Start up the pump and check for leaks.  With even the smallest amount of
 luck, your pump will be happy for another thousand years. :)

<h4><A NAME="cvapsd25">Rehabilitating a Precision Scientific D25 Rotary Vane
 Vacuum Pump</A></h4>

I picked up this small belt-driven pump up for $15 at a garage sale about 10
years ago (my first vacuum pump!)  but just got around to evaluating its
condition in depth.  Mine doesn't actually say Precision Scientific D25 -
the nameplate lists the manufacturer as Madden Brass, a division of Robinaire.
Robinaire still manufactures refrigeration service vacuum pumps today and
has no reference to the D25 or anything similar.
The D25 has about the same specifications as a Welch 1400
- 25 liters/minute, 0.1 microns ultimate vacuum (under ideal conditions with
special low vapor pressure oil of course!).  See
<A HREF="ps-d25.jpg">Precision Scientific D25 Rotary
Vane Vacuum Pump</A> for a photo of a genuine D25.  Mine looks very similar
except that there is no gas ballast valve (visible near the belt guard), it
doesn't have a belt guard, and the paint job isn't nearly as ugly. :)
<p>
Before I started collecting thermocouple vacuum gauges, the only tests I could
actually perform were (1) seeing how well it would suck a finger, (2) checking
the vacuum on a Bourdon tube gauge, and (3) testing the discharge color with my
flyback RF source.  It passed the first two of these with flying colors
but the discharge color test indicated a pressure somewhat below 1 Torr
but possibly not by much.  The sound it made was also abnormal - quite loud
and throbbing even when pumping its capped inlet.  This sound was the main
reason I decided not to be happy with just sub-Torr performance and do more
than let it rot. :)  In fact, I didn't really even know whether it was
a single stage or two stage pump until comparing photos of several Precision
Scientific pumps since no model number was ever legible.  Only after writing
this did I go look again at the information on the nameplate - almost totally
illegible but I could at least make out "gas ballasted two-stage pump".  I
still haven't figured out how the gas ballast works since there is no gas
ballast valve like the one on the genuine D25 nor anything internal in its
place that could introduce atmospheric pressure air into the exhaust stream.
However, it might have used that gap between the reeds.  In that case, it's
just as well the pump doesn't have it anymore to limit the base pressure. :)
<p>
Now that I have a couple of thermocouple gauges that are reasonably well
calibrated, I decided to test this pump to see how well or terrible it
performed.  The verdict was: somewhere in between with a base pressure of
about 150 milliTorr (150 microns).  This would be respectable for a single
stage pump with filthy oil - which this has.  But for a two stage pump,
it should do much better.  My suspicion at this point was that something
was wrong with the second stage.
<p>
The first thing I did was to check the exhaust port by unscrewing the large
silver-colored cover.  With the pump running and the inlet capped, there
shouldn't be any airflow from the exhaust port.  Imagine my surprise when
placing a finger over it resulted in <i>suction</i>!  Valves may not be
perfect but at best this should be neutral.  But there was very definite
suction.  In reality, it probably wasn't actually sucking air in through
the outlet but was probably moving it both ways and my finger was acting
as the one-way valve.  Next, I removed the cover plate (4 screws) and then
made a big mistake: I started the pump and got a face full of oil! :(
<p>
But, there was something very strange about what I found under the cover
plate: half a reed valve!  I probably looked at this 10 years ago and
didn't think anything of it but now a problem was clearly evident.  The
valve is made of a single piece of spring steel and should have had two
"fingers" but one of them was missing.  The valve is supposed to prevent
back-flow of air into the second stage outlet tube.  With the valve being
non-functional, the oil was being very seriously churned resulting in lots of
bubbles - the oil had a nice head which were perhaps the main cause of the
pump's inability to go below 150 microns.  With the reed valves submerged in
oil, the oil really does the sealing so the reeds don't need to make gas-tight
contact but they need to be present!  To construct a replacement reed, at
least as a test, I took a piece of thin polyethylene plastic (a liner from a
package of smoked salmon if you must know!), cut it to fit, and installed
it held in place under what's left of the remaining reed and its screw.
With this addition, the pump sounded a lot better - basically normal.
<p>
However, I made the mistake of wanting to retrieve the broken piece of reed.
Leaving potential time bombs inside equipment always bothers me.  In this
case, the chance of any damage from it would have been minimal since it was
clearly minding its business at the bottom of the sump but that never
stopped me from ripping things apart. :)  Six cap screws hold
the actual pump assembly to the outer casting (these are at the periphery
around the label but not visible in the photo.  After draining the oil
(I did remember to do that!), taking off the pulleys and belt, and removing
the six cap screws, the guts could be pulled free.  Wow! Look at all the muck
at the bottom of the sump!  I retrieved the broken reed and cleaned out as
much of the disgusting black grainy oil as I could.  This is one reason why
using flushing oil is important - no matter how many plain oil changes are
performed, they won't dislodge the crud at the bottom of the sump.  Flushing
oil might have a chance.  With this pump, the drained oil always looked
reasonably clean and I never suspected what lurked hidden in the sump.  The
pump chambers probably also need cleaning but I'm not <i>that</i> determined
to go inside!
<p>
Unfortunately, one additional problem developed that was unexpected:
The main shaft seal consists of a machined metal surface on the inside of the
outer casting against which a flat plastic ring rotates with the shaft.
This forms the rotating part of the seal.  The ring is inside a metal cup
against the flared end of a molded rubber piece which fits snugly on the shaft.
This seals the shaft to the ring.  Normally, a strong spring maintains
pressure on the rotating part of the seal with the rubber sleeve sliding on
the shaft to adjust as the pump assembly is slid in place.  On this old pump,
the rubber had gotten stuck to the shaft so when the spring was released, it
ripped the flared end from the rest of the rubber piece.  (I noticed later that
the rubber was a bit cracked in places so it was destined to fail eventually
anyhow.)  Initially, I didn't realize that there was anything wrong with
the seal and put the pump back together.  It pumped fine but leaked all
over the table.  After disassembling it for the second time and finding
the problem, I unstuck the rubber from the shaft, lined up the broken pieces
as best I could, and added an additional spring of my own to keep them
together - hopefully.
<p>
With the pump attached to my home-built thermocouple gauge, the pressure
reached 30 microns before the shaft seal started gushing oil.  OK, it didn't
actually <i>gush</i> but was in the process of forming a nice puddle. :)  The
pressure was still going down slowly but how far it could go will have to wait
until a new seal can be obtained or devised.  An alternative to buying the
Precision Scientific shaft seal kit at some ridiculous price (cheapest I've
found so far is $41 - all I really need is that rubber piece) might be to
obtain a $2 1/2" oil seal from an auto parts store and simply glue it in place
outside the pump (possibly mounted on a large plate) - there is plenty of room
behind the pulley.  Either RTV Silicone or Epoxy would be satisfactory.  There
is no air pressure (positive or negative) between the inside and outside of
the outer casting so it shouldn't be difficult to maintain a decent seal.
However, one potential problem with this approach is that since the pump
assembly is mounted from the other end of the outer casting, there would
be some very slight lateral movement of the shaft when the belt is installed
and during operation and this might be too much for a typical oil seal to
tolerate.
<p>
The improvised reed valve was still working and as far as I can tell, was
doing its job as well as the original but would probably fail at some point
not being made of the proper material.  Since it's just a piece of spring
steel, a new one could be cut from sheet steel and then tempered.  Or
perhaps just a thicker piece of polyethylene will survive for the amount
of use I will give this pump.
<p>
Anyhow, back to the oil seal problem.  I went to an auto parts store and asked
about oil seals.  They looked at me like I was from Mars and weren't going to
be bothered trying to find something as inconsequential (to their bottom line)
as an oil seal without a specific part number.  Therefore, I went to Plan B.
(Plans C and D available upon request). :)  I found a rubber washer with a
center hole just under 1/2" (the diameter of the pump shaft), trimmed it to
fit inside the metal cup thing and slid everything onto the shaft.  Although
not quite as robust as the original custom rubber piece, the spring pressure
should maintain a good seal - again hopefully.
<p>
I have run the pump for about an hour so far still using the old crappy oil.
It levels off at about 20 or 25 microns without cooling.  With cooling to
minimize the vapor pressure of the oil, it reaches about 15 microns.  If
my RF source is turned on for a few seconds and then turned off, the pressure
drops still further but creeps back to its previous reading.  This would seem
to indicate that back-streaming of gases dissolved in the oil is probably
still the limit, not the pump itself.  In any case, new oil should allow it
to maintain 15 microns or maybe even slightly better without cooling which
isn't bad for an old refrigeration service pump.
<p>
The shaft seal (and reed valve) are holding up just fine.  There is a slight
oil seepage around the main case gasket which isn't surprising since I've
taken the thing apart a half dozen times without replacing the gasket.  I've
added a bead of "Form-A-Gasket 2" which should take care of that problem until
I can buy or make a proper replacement.  It's ugly but works fine.
<p>
One other minor quirk appeared and I don't know whether it is inherent to
this pump or due to my reed valve which may work too well: If left under
vacuum when switched off, after awhile the pump chambers fill with oil.
Apparently there is no relief valve between the first and second stages - none
is visible but it's also possible it is hidden inside and just stuck or
clogged.  So when attempting to start up the pump, the first 2 or 3 rotations
of the pulley have tough spots as the incompressible oil is forced between
small gaps between rotating parts.  (This behavior is common with
some Welch belt-driven pumps as well.)  At first I thought the slight gap
between the reeds in the original reed valve was there to allow venting after
shutdown as it would drain the small amount of oil in the reed valve
compartment and then suck atmospheric pressure air into the pump chambers
rather than oil.  So, I turned my polyethylene reed over - it has smooth and
rough sides - to use its rough side in the hope that would reduce the seal
and act as a substitute.  That didn't help so I drilled a 2 mm hole in the
polyethylene (I have plenty more!) and that didn't help either.  With the
hole, the pump still appeared to be working properly but made a more pronounced
throbbing sound which I didn't like so I installed a new polyethylene reed.
My conclusion is that the behavior is a quirk of the pump since it's intended
for HVAC service and typically wouldn't be left connected to a vacuum, or
there is an internal relief valve and it is isn't working.  Adding a vacuum
vent valve to the system should take care of it for the future!  As a side
note, absolutely no evidence of wear was visible anywhere on the polyethylene
sheet that was removed - just a slight dimple at the location of the output
port hole.  Although the run time of a couple of hours is no indication of
long term reliability this is encouraging.
<p>
After draining the dreadful oil and running the pump with a load of flushing
oil for about an hour, then replacing that with Precision Plus "Plus Duo"
oil (similar to Welch Duo Seal oil at much less cost), it goes down to about
8 microns without cooling and under 3 microns with a small fan blowing on the
pump casing.  This base pressure is actually quite impressive considering the
pump's likely previous life.  It was still going down, though slowly, when
I called it quites.  And the smoked salmon liner reed valve
replacement still seems to be in pristine condition after several hours
of use!  Finally, replacing the old gasket (carboard type from Precision
Plus) eliminated the need for the ugly sealing job. :)

<h4><A NAME="cvadipd">Disassembling and Inspecting a Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A
 Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A></h4>

The following should apply in general to other model Pfeiffer rotary vane
two stage vacuum pumps with obvious changes in the details.  For single
state ("Uno") pumps, only the stage against the pump bulkhead (the vertical
piece that separates the pump from the motor) will be present
but otherwise, the procedure is similar.  The complete operation and service
manual for the Uno/Duo 1.5A used to be available at the
<A HREF="http://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/">Pfeiffer Vacuum</A> Web site.
But they now only have manuals for pumps still in production.
However, I can provide a PDF of the Uno/Duo 1.5 manual if needed.  It
is recommended that at least the pages with the exploded diagrams be printed
out for reference as well as the disassembly procedure in there (though the
one below is somewhat more detailed).  The Uno/Duo 1.5A is considered an
obsolete model but that doesn't make it any less useful as long as major
repair parts aren't needed.  However, this may be why the manual includes
complete service info and exploded assembly diagrams - not present on the
Pfeiffer models in current production.
<p>
CAUTION: This procedure may not apply even in the generalities to Welch or
other rotary vane pumps as many of these require special procedures for
rotor centering.  Pfeiffer pumps use precision steel dowels to align
everything and are about as simple as is possible in terms of the number
of individual components and the ease of servicing.
<p>
The reason I decided to go inside was mainly an unexplained noise best
described as a sputtering or stuttering even at high vacuum.  The base
pressure of 4 to 5 microns wasn't terrible but is higher than the spec in
the manual - 0.66 micron (though I was told by a Pfeiffer repair technician
that 2 or 3 microns is really what to expect if everything is perfect.  And
that <i>is</i> the base pressure specification on current model Pfeiffer Duo
pumps).  The real reason was the noise.  If you like to skip to the end of
the mystery novel, I eliminated some of the noise by plugging the noise
damper leak nozzle totally, though I'm not sure the new type of noise is
an actual improvement.
<p>
I have since acquired a second Duo 1.5A and while this one had a
somewhat similar noise audible from the exhaust port, it is lower intensity
and virtually undetectable when covered.  So, there is something different
about the two pumps but I have not determined what it is.
<p>
Here is the step-by-step disassembly and inspection procedure of everything
readily accessible externally or within the oil case.  Descriptions assume
looking toward the pump from the pump-side of the entire assembly.  (What I
call the "bulkhead" is the vertical piece with the vacuum and exhaust
connections separating the motor from the pump itself.)  A set of
<i>metric</i> hex wrenches, a medium size flat blade screwdriver, an adjustable
wrench, needlenose pliers, and a few other common hand tools are required.
Also have an ample supply of lint-free rags available to deal with the
unavoidable oil that will try to go everywhere.  (There's no way around
losing a few percent of the oil so some extra will be needed when refilling
even if reusing the old oil.)  For actual disassembly of the inner pump
assembly, provide a padded area where parts can't roll
away.  I used a shallow tray with typing paper as a cushion.  Pump oil
should be used liberally on all parts during reassembly.
<p>
<b>Gas ballast valve (if present)</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unscrew the knurled valve handle.  This may not actually be attached to
 the needle itself but if it isn't, the needle and spring should pop out
 when it is removed.  (The "needle" is actually a wide metal piece with a
 tapering end.)
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>If the needle and spring pops out, it is a simple matter to inspect the
  seat, needle, and spring.
<p>
 <li>If the needle sticks inside, then use an adjustable wrench to unscrew
  the entire gas ballast valve assembly.  On mine, I had to whack it on a
  wooden board to use inertia to free the stuck needle, then cleaned and
  polished the parts with steel wool.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Reassemble and confirm free movement of the needle as the knurled knob
 is turned.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Safety valve electrical testing (if present)</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If your Duo 1.5A has the "safety valve" feature, there will be a 4 pin
 connector on the lower right side of the bulkhead (facing the pump side).  A
 dirty or defective safety valve is a common cause of poor vacuum performance
 or almost no vacuum at all.  The safety valve consists of an electrically
 operated solenoid valve powered by a small generator on the rotating shaft
 of the pump which vents the pump when power is removed.  At the same time,
 air entering the valve also closes a separate valve which seals the vacuum
 chamber maintaining it at some decent vacuum after shutdown.  How good it is
 will depend on the size of the evacuated volume relative to the small amount
 of air that leaks in before the valve closes (assuming it is in working
 order).  For an inlet capped with just a vacuum gauge, a few dozen Torr
 may be typical.
<p>
 There is no need to go behind the connector if the following tests have
 acceptable results:
<p>
 <ol>
 <li>With the pump running, the voltage across pins 2 and 4 should be
  4.5 to 5.5 VRMS AC.
<p>
 <li>With the pump running, the voltage across pins 1 and 3 should be
  3.5 to 4.5 VDC.
 </ol>
<p>
 If both voltage are much higher, the solenoid of the safety valve is open or
 there is a bad connection in the wiring to the solenoid.  If both voltages
 are much lower, there may be a short circuit in the solenoid coil or a
 shorted diode or capacitor.  If (1) is high but (2) is low or 0, there is
 a problem with the diodes or their wiring.
<p>
 CAUTION: It is possible to remove the connector by taking out the two screws,
 but take extreme care not to break the wires running up into the pump - there
 is no way to reattach them.  You would have to drill a hole in the pump
 bulkhead and feed new wires through there, sealing them in place.  Not a
 disaster but certainly annoying.
</ul>
<p>
For the following, the safety valve is assumed to be present.  If your pump
does not have this feature, just ignore those steps which deal with it.
Refer to the on-line manual for other differences.
<p>
Note: For testing, the safety valve can be forced into the "vacuum" position
by using something to block the valve seat.  This will confirm whether the
vacuum performance is being affected by a defective safety valve.  However,
leaving it like this may result in pump oil being sucked into the vacuum
chamber after shutdown and may also prevent the motor from restarting
if the system is under vacuum.
<p>
<b>Safety valve vacuum chamber valve inspection and testing (if present)</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Remove any vacuum system components attached to the inlet port.
<p>
<li>Protect the inlet flange from tool damage and use a suitable wrench to
 unscrew it.
<p>
<li>Inspect the O-ring for damage or deterioration.
<p>
<li>The bottom of the flange assembly is the seat for the vacuum valve.
 Inspect it for damage.
<p>
<li>Grip and remove the moving part of the vacuum valve with a pair of
 tweezers or other similar tool that won't damage it.  It should come off
 easily and move freely up and down when in place freely.  Inspect the
 seating surface for damage.
<p>
<li>Replace the parts in reverse order.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Initial pump disassembly</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Drain the oil by removing the drain plug.  After most of the oil had
 drained, run the pump with the inlet open for about 15 seconds to clear oil
 from the pump chambers.  Tilt the pump toward the drain hole and continue
 to drain the oil until no more comes out.  Replace the drain plug.
<p>
<li>Using the proper metric hex wrench, slowly loosen the two large cap
 screws that hold the cover in place just enough to determine if the gasket
 will detach cleanly from one or both surfaces.  On mine, it came free from
 both.  However, if the pump has seen a long and hard life without service,
 a putty knife or something similar may be required to free it - hopefully
 without too much damage.  Since an exact replacement may no longer be
 available, preserving the gasket is particularly important.  If it should
 tear, you may have to carve a replacement out of suitable gasket material.
<p>
<li>Once the gasket is free, remove the screws completely and set the cover
 (and gasket if it comes off the pump bulkhead) aside face-down on a soft
 surface.
<p>
<li>Place a lint-free rag or stack of paper towels under the pump assembly
 to collect any oil that continues to run off the components.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Safety valve disassembly and inspection (if present)</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully pull off the two spade lugs which attach the wires to the
 solenoid valve.  Avoid damaging the wires.  (Though these can be resolder or
 replaced if necessary - just don't overheat the feed-through terminal since
 that might cause the wire on the other side to come loose and <i>that</i>
 cannot be reattached.  You'd have to drill a hole in the bulkhead, feed a
 new wire through, then seal it.)
<p>
<li>Use an adjustable wrench to remove the bolt holding the metal tube running
 horizontally from the solenoid valve.  Use the same wrench to unscrew and
 remove the solenoid valve.  DO NOT attempt to remove the hex nut attached
 to the bulkhead, this is NOT removable and doing so will ruin your entire
 day.
<p>
<li>Wrap a turn or two of cellophane tape or something similar around the
 threads of the pipe (to protect the O-ring) of the solenoid valve and roll
 the O-ring off of it.  This pipe can now be removed from the solenoid.
<p>
<li>Protect the threads with several layers of paper or something similar
 and carefully clamp the threaded portion in a vice.  Use the adjustable
 wrench to unscrew the hex nut revealing the magnetic plunger assembly of
 the solenoid valve.
<p>
<li>Inspect the surface of the hard rubber "washer" at the end of the plunger
 that was nearest the pump bulkhead.  It should be flat with perhaps a slight
 depression where it contacted the small valve seat.  Inspect the ridge of the
 seat for corrosion or other damage.  If there is a significant depression
 from the valve seat in the rubber or the valve seat is damaged, these parts
 or the entire assembly may need to be replaced.
<p>
 The washer in my pump had a depression slightly off-center with a slightly
 rough surface.  There was some erratic behavior before disassembly.  When
 I reassembled the pump, it would not pull any significant vacuum due to
 the washer not seating properly.  I tried to repair the washer on mine.
 First, I carefully pried out the soft rubber retainer at the other end of
 the plunger freeing the spring and washer.  Using a small file, some material
 was removed from the shoulder to allow the washer to poke a bit further
 through the plunger (perhaps 0.2 mm).  Then, with the washer reinstalled
 in the plunger to maintain alignment, 600 grit sandpaper, crocus cloth, and
 then just a bed sheet (!!) were used in succession to smooth the end flat
 (flush with the plunger) and then polish it.   Unfortunately, it would
 seem that this is not good enough.  The pump will eventually pull down to
 its base pressure of a few microns but takes a very long time as the
 washer probably isn't seating quite perfectly despite being parallel
 to the end of the plunger and almost mirror-smooth.  Once it gets there,
 venting the vacuum and repumping is very quick suggesting that
 the washer needs to be hot to be pliable enough for a good seal.  Once it
 cools off, this long pump-down delay reappears.  What I have called
 "hard rubber" may have originally been much softer and is now aged and
 too inflexible to work effectively.
<p>
 Next day I fabricated a replacement from a short piece of 1/8" O-ring stock.
 I drilled a 40 mil hole most of the way through it and used a metal washer
 held by an 0-80 machine screw to form the shoulder present on the original
 piece.  Then, with this installed in the plunger, I used 600 grit sandpaper
 followed by rubbing on cloth to smooth it flush.  Even though the surface
 isn't mirror polished, the O-ring material is quite soft and the valve
 seals reliably.  Whether it is too soft and will degrade eventually is not
 known but for now, it appears to work as well as the original.
<p>
<li>Reassemble the solenoid valve in reverse order tightening everything
 just snugly enough to they won't move on their own.  The copper tube should
 be positioned with its end just below the aluminum exhaust pipe.  Install the
 two spade lugs.  Make sure the wires are routed so they won't be squashed
 when the cover is replaced.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Pump assembly removal</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Using the appropriate size metric hex wrench, remove the two large cap
 screws that hold the pump assembly in place.  CAUTION: Don't let the pump
 assembly fall on the floor!!!  Both stages of the pump can now be pulled
 free (the only thing holding them to the pump bulkhead and to each other once
 the screws are removed is the oil!).  Set the cross coupling disk aside that
 you will find between the pump assembly and drive motor.  Immediately set
 the pump assembly aside in the safe padded location you have provided.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Noise damper leak valve inspection</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Just below the long exhaust tube at the top-right of the bulkhead, there
 is a small plug with either a slot for a screwdriver, or flats for a wrench
 or needlenose pliers.  There may be a number stamped on the plug indicating
 the size of a hole in its center in microns or mils or maybe it's just a
 part ID.  On mine it says either "15" (most likely) or possibly "75".
 Use the appropriate tool to unscrew this plug, taking care not to lose
 the rubber O-ring and metal centering ring.  Inspect the hole with a bright
 light, magnifier, microscope - whatever works - to check that the hole is not
 obstructed.  If it is blocked, use a solvent and compressed air to clear it.
 DO NOT use a metal wire which may change its size.  This is the so called
 "noise damper" leak valve.  It is supposed to allow a small amount of air
 to enter the oil circuit - the passage in the bulkhead behind the plug leads
 to a tiny hole near the center of the second stage pump assembly.  Reinstall
 the plug snugly but not overly tight.
<p>
 Note that I eliminated some of the  noise from my Duo 1.5 by actually
 replacing the leak nozzle with a solid plug.  At high vacuum, it still makes
 noise but I think it is less annoying than previously.  I don't know
 if the hole was too large (it looked unmodified and undamaged) or if this
 "repair" is actually masking some other problem.  I really don't even know
 for sure that the noise I was complaining about is abnormal for this pump
 (though my second Duo 1.5A does make much less noise).
 I also don't know whether there will be any long term wear or reliability
 issues with no airflow through the noise damper leak valve.  Aside from what
 I don't know, everything else is obvious. :)  Since I didn't notice any
 difference in base pressure or pump-down performance, I will probably
 reinstall the original leak nozzle next time I have an excuse to go
 inside.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Pump assembly disassembly</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully detach the two stages if this hasn't already happened.  The only
 thing holding them together is the oil surface tension.  Inspect the cross
 coupling disk which is between them and then set it aside.  The unit closest
 to the pump is actually the second stage.  There is a hole clear through
 it which feeds to the first stage.  Set the second stage aside for now.
</ul>
<p>
<b>First Stage</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Using the appropriate metric hex wrench, remove the three screws
 holding the first stage together.  With a block of wood and a small mallet
 or other suitable tool, carefully separate the front or back piece from the
 pump chamber (doesn't really matter which).  Take care that the rotor with
 the vanes doesn't come out with parts flying everywhere.
<p>
<li>While holding onto the vanes, carefully extract the rotor and vanes.
 DO NOT allow the vanes to come off unless you mark them with a Magic Marker
 or something similar to indicate orientation.  Inspect the vanes and springs
 for damage.  Inspect the inside surfaces of the end-plates and pump chamber
 for scoring and other damage.  Serious scoring would indicate the need for
 replacement.  A coating of varnish might be removed with a strong solvent.
 Making sure the springs are in their proper holes, press the vanes together
 and reinstall the rotor.  Make sure it is in the proper direction!
<p>
<li>There is a very small hole for an oil channel (1 mm or less) in the
 end-plate that faces the second stage.  Using a non-metallic probe like
 a piece of nylon fishing line, make sure it is not obstructed.
<p>
<li>Replace the end-plate that was removed and use the wood block to carefully
 tap it back in place.  Replace the three screws and tighten securely in a
 rotating pattern in several stages.  Confirm that the rotor turns easily
 without obvious sticking or hard spots.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Second stage</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Using the appropriate metric hex wrench, remove the screws holding the
 "valve crown" on top.  Inspect the valve plunger and spring for damage.
 Replace if no damage is found.
<p>
<li>Using a medium size flat blade screwdriver, remove the three screws
 holding the second stage together.  With a block of wood and a small mallet
 or other suitable tool, carefully separate the front or back place from the
 pump chamber (doesn't really matter which).  Take care that the rotor with
 the vanes doesn't come out with parts flying everywhere.
<p>
<li>While holding onto the vanes, carefully extract the rotor and vanes.
 DO NOT allow the vanes to come off unless you mark them with a Magic Marker
 or something similar to indicate orientation.  Inspect the vanes and springs
 for damage.  Inspect the inside surfaces of the end-plates and pump chamber
 for scoring and other damage.  Serious scoring would indicate the need for
 replacement.  A coating of varnish might be removed with a strong solvent.
 Making sure the springs are in their proper holes, press the vanes together
 and reinstall the rotor.  Make sure it is in the proper direction!
<p>
<li>There is a very small hole for an oil channel (1 mm or less) in the
 end-plate that faces the pump bulkhead.  Using a non-metallic probe like
 a piece of nylon fishing line, make sure it is not obstructed.
<p>
<li>Replace the end-plate that was removed and use the wood block to carefully
 tap it back in place.  Replace the three screws and tighten securely in a
 rotating pattern in several stages.  Confirm that the rotor turns easily
 without obvious sticking or hard spots.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Pump assembly reassembly</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Install the cross coupling disk onto either stage, rotate the other stage
 so it lines up, and put the two together.  They should fit easily flush
 with the bulkhead without force, else check that they are lined up perfectly.
 CAUTION: Attempting to tighten the screws with improper alignment may cause
 damage.
<p>
<li>Install the cross coupling disk on the second stage and install the entire
 pump assembly on the pump bulkhead.  Again, this should fit easily without
 force.  Finger tighten the two cap screws, then tighten securely using the
 proper metric hex wrench in increments alternating between the two screws.
 Power up the motor for a couple of seconds just to make sure nothing is
 binding.
<p>
<li>Place the cover with gasket against the pump bulkhead and finger
 tighten the large cap screws.  Check the position of the gasket and then
 use the proper metric hex wrench to tighten the cover snugly alternating
 between the two screws.  Err on the side of looseness for now, tightening
 further only if there is oil leakage.  With luck, the gasket will last
 for 5 to 10 disassemblies but each time may require successively greater
 tightening of the screws.
<p>
<li>Replace or add new oil until at the middle of the sight glass.  With the
 pump running, add oil if needed to maintain the oil level around the middle
 of the sight glass.  Periodically check for oil leakage around the gasket
 and tighten as necessary.  I'd like to find a supplier who will sell me
 just the Duo 1.5A case gasket as mine is probably on its last life, just
 barely sealing with the screws tightened down as tight as I dare tighten
 them down.  Else I'll may have to make one myself out of cardboard or thin
 rubber stock. :)
</ul>
<p>
It may take longer than usual to achieve the base pressure after disassembly
due to moisture and other contamination of the oil unless everything has been
cleaned and only new oil is used.  Opening the gas ballast valve slightly
during a portion of the initial pump-down may help.  Subsequent pump-downs
should proceed at the expected rate unless there are other problems.

<h4><A NAME="cvadiw1">Disassembling and Inspecting a Welch 1399 Rotary Vane
 Vacuum Pump</A></h4>

In an attempt to determine why my Welch 1399 had a minute or so delay before
achieving proper performance, I decided to at least disassemble it to the
point of being able to check that the vanes were under good spring pressure
and moving freely.  This required removing the cover and exhaust valve
assembly.  Before removing the cover on any of these pumps, I recommend
having a replacement gasket on hand.  The old one, even if it doesn't fall
apart, won't seal reliably when reinstalled due to loss of resilience.
<p>
A set of hex wrenches, an adjustable wrench, and a flat blade screwdriver
will be required in addition to an adequate collection of lint-free rags
or paper towels to mop up the oil and wipe down the inside of the pump.
<p>
Here is the procedure.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Remove anything attached to the inlet and outlet ports, and the belt and
 pump and motor pulleys.
<p>
<li>Drain the oil by removing the drain plug.  After most of the oil had
 drained, run the pump with the inlet open for a few seconds to clear oil
 from the pump chambers.  Tilt the pump toward the drain hole and continue
 to drain the oil until no more comes out.  Replace the drain plug.
<p>
<li>When the screws are removed, the pump assembly will come free from
 the cover, which will remain attached to the baseplate.  Fabricate a
 "pump stand" so that the pump assembly can be positioned face-down.
 Two 10" lengths of 2x4s will work fine for this. :)
<p>
<li>Using the proper hex wrench, remove all 7 screws and set them aside.
 Make sure to support the pump assembly so it doesn't fall out!  Place the
 pump assembly on your pump stand.
<p>
<li>Wipe down the inside of the cover and the pump assembly with a clean
 rag or paper towels.  The purpose of this is to both catch the oil that
 will tend to flow everywhere and to remove some of the dirtiest of the oil
 which collects in the sump and sticks to everything.
<p>
<li>Use a flat blade screwdriver to remove the screw holding the exhaust
 valve cover in place.  Set the screw and lock-washer aside.
<p>
<li>Use an adjustable wrench or similar tool to remove the hex standoff,
 flat washer, and exhaust valve reed.  Inspect the reed for serious wear
 or corrosion.
<p>
<li>Using a narrow plastic stick (e.g., 1/8" to 3/16" diameter, at least 2"
 long), probe into the exhaust hole while carefully rotating the shaft
 (grip it with something soft or temporarily reinstall the pulley).  Feel
 for when the vane passes under the hole.  Then, press firmly with the stick
 to assure that the vane moves in and out freely.  It doesn't move much -
 perhaps 1/16 of an inch.  Compare the movement and spring force of the
 two opposing vanes - they should be equal.  The spring force should be
 substantial.
</ul>
<p>
This is as far as I went since unlike Pfeiffer pumps which have precision
pins to center the rotor, the centering of the rotor on Welch pumps has
to be done at the time of reassembly using paper shims (that get chewed up
and deposited into the oil sump once the pump is started).  I didn't want
to have to do this.  So, I reassembled the pump in reverse order using a
new gasket.  The new gasket really does make life a lot easier. :)
<p>
The results on my 1399 were that everything appeared to be in decent
condition though the pump was much dirtier inside than I had expected
given its outward appearance.  I have now run it for several more hours
with flushing fluid.  This didn't help the startup delay problem very much
but the base pressure with a small cooling fan blowing on the pump casing
is now under 25 microns.  So that's not too bad for a single-stage pump.
I wouldn't be surprised if a couple more flushings got it down below
the spec'd 15 microns.

<h4><A NAME="cvaskulv">Ulvac Direct Drive Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump With Leaky
 Shaft Seal</A></h4>

I was given what appears to be a very nice pump manufactured by the
Sinku-Kiko devision of <A HREF="http://www.ulvac.com/">Ulvac Technologies,
Inc.</A>  It is a model G-50D rated 60 liters/minute running on 60 Hz power
(about the same as a Welch 1402) or 50 l/m on 50 Hz) and has an ultimate
pressure specification of 0.1 Pascal (0.75 micron).  (There used to be a
picture of a zillion small Ulvac pumps including the model G-50D on their
Sinku-Kiko Rotary Vane Pumps Page but the page has disappeared.)
Operation is very quiet and even with old filthy oil, the
pressure gets down to below 4 microns without cooling and down below 3 microns
with a small fan blowing on it.  The only problem is that when off, the
shaft seal leaks enough to be annoying.  However, it looks like it would be a
pain to replace the seal even if it were available and reasonably priced
(defined to be similar to the Duniway shaft seal kits for Welch pumps!).
The motor rotor remains attached to the pump even when the motor housing is
removed and there is no obvious means of detaching it.  I haven't taken
the pump itself apart yet and would prefer not to do so unless there is no
choice.  Maybe I should just rig up a little aquarium pump to recycle the oil
as needed!
<p>
After running with flushing fluid for a few hours, it was drained fully and
replaced with belt-drive oil (Precision Plus Plus Duo, only because it was a
lot cheaper than direct-drive oil).  Then the pump was run with cooling until
the pressure bottomed out (under 1.4 microns - another few hours).  Finally,
this oil was drained and replaced with direct-drive oil (Precision Plus Plus
19).  It now goes down to under 0.3 microns (!!) with cooling and has by far
the best vacuum performance of any of my rotary vane pumps to date.  I believe
this low pressure - which is less than half of the pump's new spec - is mostly
due to the flushing and double oil change, not to the pump itself.
<p>
The G-50D should make a nice pump for testing thermocouple vacuum gauges
though I may have to drain the oil between testing sessions. :)
<p>
I finally did contact Ulvac via email about the shaft seal.  They responded
quickly saying it is available for $5 but unfortunately they have a $50
minimum order suggesting that perhaps I needed some pump oil.  OK, so
perhaps I was a bit dramatic in describing the leak!  They also said
it does require disassembling the entire pump to replace and suggested
that it's a good idea to install the rebuild kit for $190 as long as
one is going to all the trouble (no instructions provided).  Or, they
just happen to have a special on a slightly larger pump for only $660 plus
shipping. :(  I would probably still do the shaft seal replacement if I
can get the seal but the $50 minimum is too high an energy barrier to
cross at the moment.  Translation: It's a really good excuse not to do
this messy job yet! :)

<h4><A NAME="cvadog">When to Leave a Sleeping Dog (of a Vacuum Pump)
 Lie</A></h4>

There are hopeless cases and there are really hopeless cases. :)
<p>
(From: Ocean.)
<p>
I found what can optimistically be described as the remains of a two stage
rotary vacuum pump in a scrap yard maintained (a relative term) by
an old eccentric elite scientist type.  It was a frozen block of rust when
I found it.  Some tinkering with a brake hone and some sandpaper
has made it work again, sort of.  It gets to 27.5" Hg (relative to 1 atm)
with 90W gear oil and 26.5" Hg with 10W40 auto motor oil.  It seems to me
that even a rotary vane pump in very bad shape (parts reshaped by hand) should
do better then this maybe.  Perhaps if I put some good oil in it I could
use it as a freeze dryer or something.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
I doubt the type of oil will result in much improvement.  Probably only
the viscosity will matter, with heavier weight oils resulting in a modestly
better vacuum.  It sounds like either the original deterioration was worse
than you describe, your efforts at restoration were more drastic than you
describe, or the pump was improperly reassembled or poorly aligned (if there
are no indexing pins as with Welch-type belt driven pumps).  Probably a
combination of all of these. :)
<p>
(From: Ocean.)
<p>
In a twist of fate today I traded it to a friend of mine who runs a 
small (back alley) auto repair shop as he has been doing lots of A/C work
this  summer.  He needed a vacuum pump and I needed to use his shop to
work on my car today.  (Sometimes, crawling around in the sand just does
not cut it!)  So I left the pump with him as it is fine for getting water
out of car A/C systems but I figure it would have never met my needs for
lasers, with or without a trip to the machine shop.  It was an off brand
American made pump and from what I remember, the company no longer had
rebuild kits available because it was so old (not that a rebuild kit
would have helped).  I forgot who makes it though.
<p>
I figure there are three or four factors that are killing its vacuum:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Vane contact curvature no longer matched cylinder curvature (as well
 as there being some significant pits).
<p>
<li>Cylinders are not round, had rust pits, and wear peaks resulting
 in that familiar clunking sound, loudest at the end of the range.
 It was a trade off between tolerances and pits.
<p>
<li>Planar surfaces are no longer perfect planes or are seriously out
 of tolerance.
<p>
<li>I may have not indexed the 5 sectioned parts properly.  There are
 2 cylinders, rear head, front head, and center which holds shaft; and
 the 2 vane rotors.  Four long bolts at the corners held it together.
 The thing was so badly rusted I don't think I could have ever got
 the indexing right.
</ol>
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
My guess is that reassembling the pump with greater attention to the rotor
indexing would improve matters greatly.  What would be important is that
the tops of the cylindrical rotors be nearly touching the stators.  For
a pump in decent condition, this would likely be something like 0.001".
For this disaster, it's probably much larger.
<p>
(From: Ocean.)
<p>
It was interesting to see that a solid block of frozen rust, was 
rehabilitated to anything better than 20" Hg, as I remember it was a great 
challenge just to separate the 5 sections, unstick the vanes, make the
bearings turn and clean up all the rust.  As it was, it took me the better 
part of a long day.
<p>
I wasn't about to waste good oil on it, so I used some gear oil, fired it
up and got 27.5" Hg and thought WOW!  This was followed by yuck!  I was
using a standard differential bellows vacuum gauge, so it could have been 
off by a bit depending on the barometric pressure.  But 
living in southern California, it's usually high pressure an Sunny.
Anyway, it's out to pasture, sucking happily away at derelict A/C 
systems now. :)
<p>
He said that he is going to replace the motor oil with HVAC oil, so
next time I'm down there I think will take a peek and see how its 
doing, my guess is it might step it up to maybe 28.5" of Hg.
<p>
Anyway the lesson is that if it's frozen, throw it back unless you want 
reliable piston compressor performance.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs5">Salvaged Refrigeration Compressors as Vacuum
 Pumps</A></h3>

How many refrigerators, window air conditioners, freezers, and dehumidifiers,
have you hauled to the dump or passed up on the curb????  The compressor
(using its suction inlet) in these systems may be pressed into service as a
vacuum pump where a low (and in some cases, medium) vacuum is acceptable.
However, before you get too excited, realize that finding a suitable
refrigeration compressor (or more than one to use in series) may be a
crap-shoot.  Many types are at best marginal even for the minimal requirements
of the nitrogen (N2) laser.  It's not only a matter of the condition of the
the compressor, since they are designed for compression, the vacuum
performance may simply be mediocre.  Personally, I would go for a real
vacuum pump unless cost is the most important consideration and you're
just going to run the laser only long enough to see that it works and then
move onto some other hobby. :)  Almost any real vacuum pump (including
refrigeration service types) - even one that has been neglected and abused -
will pull a better vacuum than most refrigeration compressors, and will be
less hassle and more reliable.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacvs12">Sources for Vacuum Equipment and Supplies</A>.
<p>
Having said all that, a used refrigeration compressor will probably be very
close to free and that's often hard to pass up! :)
<p>
A detailed discussion of using refrigeration compressors
as vacuum pumps is provided in the hard copy version of
<A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/">The Bell Jar - Vacuum Technique
for the Amateur</A>.  (<A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/articles.htm">The
Electronic Bell Jar</A> being the subset of these articles that are on-line.
Check that site for contact and subscription info.)
<p>
<ul>
<li>The compression ratio to achieve a pressure of P (in atm above atmospheric
 pressure) is P+1.  For a vacuum, this is reversed and starts with the
 compressed volume (at 1 atm) which is then expanded by P+1.  Based on
 the ratio of displacements alone (ignoring all other losses), a
 pump that can achieve a pressure of P when used as a compressor, can
 produce a vacuum in Torr of 760/(P+1).
<p>
 (However, this doesn't take the valve spring force into consideration, which
 can be a significant limiting factor for pulling a decent vacuum.)  Since a
 typical *working* pressure (not even the ultimate possible) for a
 refrigeration system is several hundred psi (10s of atm), a vacuum below
 100 Torr should be easily achievable with any of these and some will go
 down below 1 Torr.   Note: The specifications you find in the little
 service booklet that came with your refrigerator may only indicate
 1/3 atm (250 Torr) performance.  Just ignore them!
<p>
 For example, for a compressor capable of 90 psi (about 6 atm above atmospheric
 pressure), the compression ratio is about 6:1.  Thus, the achievable vacuum
 under ideal conditions would be limited to about 130 Torr.
<p>
<li>Refrigeration compressors are piston, single stage rotary vane, or
 scroll-type pumps.  (See <A HREF="vacpumps.gif">Vacuum Pumps Suitable for
 Various Home-Built Lasers</A> for diagrams including typical refrigeration
 compressors.)  Therefore, don't expect to achieve 10<sup>-6</sup> Torr or
 even be guaranteed adequate performance to provide the rough vacuum for a
 diffusion pump:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Piston compressors will be limited to several 10s of Torr - which is
 adequate only for the N2 and possibly some CO2 lasers.  This type is found
 in most refrigerators, freezers, dehumidifiers, and some air conditioners.
 The cases for these tend to be short and fat and due to the loose springy
 suspension of the innards, will "clunk" when shaken.
<p>
<li>Rotary compressors are similar in performance to true single stage vacuum
 pumps capable of achieving an ultimate vacuum of 1 Torr or better which is
 sufficient for many of the home-built lasers (and other) medium vacuum
 applications.  They tend to be tall and skinny, with the innards
 welded to the case so they don't go "clunk" when shaken. :)  Apparently,
 rotary compressors are found mostly in air conditioners and the
 compressor itself is usually manufactured by Matsushita (though the brand
 of the A/C itself may include Amana, GE, Sharp, Westinghouse, Whirlpool, and
 others.  I believe there was also a run of GE rotary compressors used in
 various model <i>refrigerators</i>.  However, as I recall, they had problems
 and a recall of sorts.  Therefore, you don't want one of those!)  The
 rotary compressor from a medium size window A/C - say 8,000 btu/hour - would
 have a capacity of about 1.5 cfm - somewhat higher than a Welch 1399 or
 1400 vacuum pump.  However, rotary compressors even in air conditioners may
 be rare today and I don't really know of any way to positively identify this
 type from external appearance.  Tall skinny ones used to be of the rotary
 type but are now more likely to be what's called a "scroll compressor".
<p>
<li>Scroll compressors used in refrigeration applications may not suck well
 as vacuum pumps (though the basic capabilities are similar and scroll vacuum
 pumps exist. :)  (If you're curious, see:
 <A HREF="http://www.airsquared.com/">Air Squared Scroll Compressor and Vacuum
 Pumps</A> for some info on scroll compressors.  The animated logo on
 their homepage shows how they work.
</ul>
<p>
<li>First, confirm that the compressor is good.  While there is no way to be
 sure that it will produce an adequate vacuum without tests, if you have the
 choice, select a unit that was working, cooling wise.  If the rotor is
 locked (blows fuses, cycles on the overload) or if it runs and runs and runs
 and all that happens is that parts get warm or hot (including the evaporator
 coils), the compressor itself may be faulty.  These compressors are all of
 totally welded construction and essentially impossible to open for repair or
 even inspection!  If the refrigerant charge has leaked out (little or no
 hissing and no frost forms when the lines are cut) but the compressor still
 runs, it is probably still good.
<p>
<li>Use a tubing cutter (NOT a hacksaw) to disconnect the compressor from the
 rest of the system.  This will prevent metal particles from contaminating
 the system.  There may be multiple ports to the compressor itself but only
 two should need to be cut.  Once the integrity of the system is breached,
 just let everything sit until the Freon bleeds out before cutting completely
 through.  Then cap the ends to prevent the entry of dirt and moisture.
<p>
 WARNING: The escaping Freon will be COLD - enough to cause frostbite.  Let
 it alone until some time after the hissing stops!
<p>
 WARNING: While Freon itself is non-flammable, poisonous gases will result
 from contact with an open flame.  Do this outside!
<p>
 Note: It is currently against EPA regulations to release CFCs (e.g, Freon)
 into the atmosphere and therefore cutting the the refrigerant lines to remove
 the compressor without recovering the Freon is against the law.  Therefore,
 consider having a HVAC service company purge the Freon for you - it is even
 possible they will do this free of charge (as long as you deliver and pick
 up the appliance) since the recovered Freon is worth something.
<p>
<li>When ripping things apart, don't forget the starting relay, capacitor (if
 any), and thermal protector ('Guardette' in the typical schematic) and make
 a note of the wiring.  Then, mount it on a solid wooden base the same way it
 was oriented in the original appliance and wire it up to its own cord,
 switch, and plug!  See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacvs5a">Salvaged
 Refrigeration Compressor Wiring</A>
<p>
<li>Since these compressors depend on the cold Freon entering via the suction
 line to help cool the internal mechanism, the unit may run hot if operated
 continuously.  Leaving the thermal protector in the circuit will at least 
 shut down the system before it gets too hot.  A fan blowing on the case may
 help.  However, since pumping from a perfect vacuum (yeh, sure!) to 1 atm
 is a lot less work than compressing to the many atm required normally for
 refrigeration, the heating may not be that bad - but operation overnight for
 roughing a diffusion pump may be pushing your luck even if it can achieve an
 acceptably low pressure!
<p>
<li>During normal operation, oil circulates with the refrigerant.  With the
 loop broken (after all you are only sucking!), some types will be starved of
 lubrication.  Such 'pumps' have been reported to be quite reliable under
 these conditions with only an occasional squirt of oil into to the suction
 line but I don't know how to predict this based model number or external
 appearance.  So, your mileage may vary.
<p>
 It is critical that there always be adequate lubricating oil in the system.
 There is no telling how much was actually in the compressor when you cut it
 away from the rest of the appliance.  An HVAC service company may be able to
 help.  Some of the proper oil can be SLOWLY added via the suction port (some
 compressors will be damaged attempting to compress an incompressible fluid
 if it is added too quickly).  If too much oil is in the compressor, it will
 spurt out the pressure port in excessive quantities.
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Provide a glass wool or similar filter and container on the pressure port
  to catch oil that is ejected there.  Commercial vacuum pumps generally have
  some means of collecting and/or recycling any expelled oil.  However, since
  refrigeration compressors were designed for use in sealed systems where the
  oil circulates with the refrigerant, oil handling must be taken care of
  externally.  Preventing the oil from escaping is critical for several
  reasons:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The oil mist is a serious health hazard.
  <li>It may be flammable and that isn't something you want around your
   high voltage power supply.
  <li>This will make it possible to keep track of how much oil is lost.
  <li>And, there would otherwise be an oily mess.
  </ul>
<p>
  During operation, check the amount of oil in the container from time to time
  (by weight if necessary).  There will always be a small amount of oil
  expelled out the pressure port of the pump.  However, if the loss becomes
  too great, you will have to add some oil (very slowly to the input) to
  maintain adequate lubrication.
<p>
  WARNING: As noted above, catching the expelled oil isn't just to prevent that
  mess.  The significance of the health and fire hazards cannot be over
  emphasized.
<p>
 <li>In principle, it would be straightforward to implement an automatic oil
  bypass system to return expelled oil to the suction port - a simple float
  operated needle valve that opens only when the oil level in the output
  container exceeds a set value (to prevent air from entering the suction
  side).  Details are left as an exercise for the student. :-)
</ul>
<p>
 In any case, to prevent oil from back-streaming into the vacuum system,
 provide a filter in-line with the compressor suction port.
<p>
<li>The metal tubing found in the evaporator and capillary (aluminum or copper)
 and condenser (probably steel) of a refrigeration unit may also be useful but
 must be cleaned thoroughly of all contaminants like oil if it is to form part
 of the vacuum side of your system.
<p>
<li>It may be possible to two such units in series to achieve a better vacuum
 but you will just have to try it to be sure!
</ul>
<p>
Speaking of hooking two pumps in series, I've even heard of this being done
with those pathetic excuses for vacuum pumps used on solder rework stations.
Apparently, this approach was adequate to reach the 100 Torr level required
by the N2 laser!

The sealed unit has 3 pins usually marked: S (Start), R or M (Run or Main),

<p>
The Starting Relay engages when power is applied due to the high current
through the Run winding (and thus the relay coil) since the compressor rotor
is stationary.  This applies power to the Start winding.  Once the compressor
comes up to speed, the current goes down and the Starting Relay drops out.
(Some models may use other starting schemes but this is the most common.)
You can always use a heavy duty pushbutton switch in place of the starter
if you like or if you lost the original starting relay. :-(
<p>
Leave the the Thermal Protector (often called a "Guardette" which I presume
is a brand name) in place - it may save your compressor by shutting it down
if the temperature rises too high due to lack of proper cooling or an overload
(blocked exhaust port or low line voltage).

<h4><A NAME="cvacvs5b">Chris's Comments on Refrigeration Compressors</A></h4>

I have used both refrigerator compressors as vacuum pumps and commercial
vacuum pumps in operating my home-built CO2 lasers. Some of the compressors
that you come upon will work much better than others in this application. It
is advisable to collect a number of these for testing. They can usually be
salvaged for free, so this should not be a problem. When you find the 'best'
one, I would suggest flushing out the original compressor oil and refilling
with a good quality mechanical vacuum pump oil for improved performance.
There are a couple of drawbacks to using these types of 'pumps'. One is their
tendency to become very hot if operated for extended periods and the other is
their tendency to allow large quantities of oil to backflow into the vacuum
vessel when shut down. Always clamp off the vacuum line to the laser before
turning off the power to the 'pump'.
<p>
However, I would strongly suggest that you purchase a refrigeration service
vacuum pump if you can afford the $300.00 or so price tag. These inexpensive
vacuum pumps will be much superior for anything except perhaps the N2 laser
since they are able to pump to much lower pressures - and with fewer hassles.

<h4><A NAME="cvacvs5c">John's Comments on Refrigeration Compressors</A></h4>

Some of the comments below may depend on compressor type - rotary compressors
found in some systems behave differently and have differing requirements than
piston compressors.
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
Chest or upright freezer compressor - yes, refrigerator compressor - maybe,
AC compressor - no.
<p>
Refrigeration compressors are marginal because they depend on the freon flow
for part of their cooling.  Little to no flow in vacuum service.  The ambient
pressure around the compressor motor is vastly lower so convection cooling is
not available.  AC compressors are even more dependent on refrigerant cooling.
Besides that, they have a larger clearance volume (space above the piston) in
order to limit exhaust valve temperature and this limits the ultimate vacuum
achieved to less than what we need.
<p>
Freezer compressors, because they are designed to run at low pressure to low
vacuum depending on temperature set-point, will work fine for vacuum service.
They have small clearance volumes and they can cool themselves just fine
without freon flow.
<p>
Two such compressors in series will provide enough vacuum to backup a small
diffusion pump for high vacuum service.  I used just such a setup with a
homemade linear accelerator I built back in high school.
<p>
Don't use PVC tubing.  The plasticizer incorporated to make the PVC flexible
has a fairly high vapor pressure and will contaminate everything.  The red
rubber vacuum hose is fairly inexpensive in small diameter.  Surgical tubing
can be used if a spring is inserted to prevent collapse.  Some automotive
vacuum hoses should work but may require a solvent wash to eliminate process
lubricants that may out-gas.
<p>
I haven't seen a rotary type refrigeration compressor in so long that I think
they're extinct.  Most of the tall skinny cans now contain scroll compressors
and they suck for vacuum pumps.  Or, I guess they don't suck enough. :-)
<p>
I have a couple of compressors I pulled from equipment around the
restaurant.  I intend to cut the cans open and see if there is
anything a home hacker can do to improve the vacuum.  Something like
perhaps replacing the intake valve with shim stock or grind the head
down to reduce clearance volume, etc.

<h4><A NAME="cvacvs5d">Steve's Comments on Alternative Refrigeration Compress</A></h4>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
I got about 1 Torr into a small load with the best used fridge
compressor I found when I was a kid.  This was good enough for getting an air
plasma up but not enought for what I wanted to do.  Refrigeration
compressors used as vacuum pumps tend to cook themselves unless you
flow the proper oil through them.  In a normal fridge, a small amount
of the oil spins through the system with the Freon.  What seemed to be
the problem was the inlet check valve.  Today if I had to use a fridge
compressor, I would be able to cut open the hermetic package and do
something about that, but back then I had no welding skills.
<p>
Finding a decent pump is really not hard unless you're in the middle
of nowhere.  You can find a Welch pump and rebuild it or get a air
conditioning service pump for $200.  I really urge you if your serious
about vacuum to try to locate a standard pump, a simple single stage
Welch or Edwards SpeedyVac (about the bottom of the used pump barrel)
surplus  in really bad condition will almost always beat the best
fridge compressor, and in the future would be easy to rebuild. My
idea of a bad Welch is one from the chemistry side of
our building here at the university, where the Chemists pump acid
vapors and pieces of paper and God only knows what else through the
pump oil and never change it and it will have bad shaft seals too.  A
bad one still gets around 110 millitorr after you run it long enough
to cook the water out of the old oil.  A two stage Welch probably
still meets the low budget class and will do even better.
<p>
Note in all these things, whether fridge and professional: The quality of the
oil makes or breaks the vacuum.  The oil is actually what forms the
shaft and rotor vacuum seals in the pump.  Therefore, good oil is a must.

<h2>Vacuum Gauges</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cvagtype">Types of Vacuum Gauges</A></h3>

Some means of determining the precise level of vacuum is perhaps not totally
essential but certainly highly desirable.  Otherwise, whatever you do is like
a shot in the dark.  The old 'thumb over the hole' trick really isn't precise
enough!
<p>
There are two fundamental classes of vacuum measurement devices:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Direct reading vacuum gauges</b> are based on fundamental principles of
 gas compressibility and don't depend on electronic conversion from a a sensor
 to a readout.  These include Bourdon tube, McLeod, and other liquid
 monometers, and aneroid (and of course, mercury) barometers.  The
 capacitance manometer gauge uses an electrical readout but senses the actual
 pressure directly.
<p>
<li><b>Indirect reading vacuum gauges</b> sense some parameter of the remaining
 gas such as its thermal conductivity or ion conduction and translate this to
 a readout.  These include thermocouple, thermistor, Pirani, and ion gauges.
</ul>
<p>
Here are some of the types in common use:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bourdon tube:</b>  This is the sort of gauge you see on air compressors
 and bad sci-fi movies - a round body with a pointer and dial operated
 mechanically.  Basically, the pressure/vacuum is applied to a curved thin
 walled metal tube.  The amount of pressure differential determines by how
 much the tube's curvature changed (positive pressure tends to make it want
 to straighten out).  The tube's end is attached to a chain and pulley
 arrangement which operates the dial pointer.  These are adequate for low
 vacuums and confirming that your pump is working at all but cannot measure
 consistently below a few dozen Torr unless the reference (outside the curved
 tube) is also in a vacuum (which I have never heard of).  The fundamental
 problem is that the actual atmospheric (barometric) pressure directly affects
 the reading.  (Is a storm brewing resulting in low barometric pressure?)
 Since weather conditions can change the local barometric pressure by several
 percent (1 percent = 7.6 Torr), it is easy to see why there can be
 difficulties with this approach!
<p>
 A Bourdon tube <i>pressure</i> gauge that goes to 10 or 15 psi may be used
 for vacuum measurements as well if its zero position is reset by shifting the
 relationship of the rack and pinion (or whatever they are called) gears
 inside.  Sometimes this happens automagicly if the gauge is dropped. :(
<p>
 I have a bunch of Bourdon tube gauges.  They are useful for low vacuum work
 but unless you listen to the local weather report, you may think your pump
 isn't operating as well on those days where the barometric pressure is low
 (because at perfect vacuum, the pointer will only move an amount equal to
 the local pressure)!  You can get around this, sort of. :)  Neither of the
 following is particularly recommended but might work in a pinch:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Seal a Bourdon tube vacuum gauge inside of a rigid container with exactly
 1 atm of pressure.  Then, the gauge will be independent of local barometric
 pressure (but not of temperature!).  Since the container doesn't need to
 stand up to an actual vacuum - just the difference between 1 atm and local
 conditions, any old pickle jar should work fine.
<p>
<li>Seal a Bourdon tube *pressure* gauge (with a range of around 0 to 15 psi)
 inside of a vacuum-safe vessel which has been evacuated to the limits of your
 vacuum pump(s).  Now, attaching your vacuum system to the pressure port will
 result in a direct reading relative to a that vacuum, not the atmosphere.
 However, I wouldn't trust a pickle jar to stand up to a hard vacuum!
<p>
 For greater sensitivity, it may be possible to use a gauge with a smaller
 range but its needle will be pegged off scale with no or low vacuum and this
 may harm the mechanism.  If you have a Bourdon type sphygmomanometer (a.k.a.,
 blood pressure gauge - not the mercury type!) that you are willing to try,
 that could give a usable reading down to less than 1 Torr but might not
 survive too high a pressure differential (1 atm would end up being over 2.5X
 its typical range of 300 mm of Hg).
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Closed tube manometer:</b>  A 'U' shaped tube, sealed at one end, is
 partially filled with mercury or other low vapor pressure fluid (like
 diffusion pump oil) so that there is no space left above the fluid at the
 closed end.  The difference in the levels of the fluid in the two arms is an
 indication of level of vacuum once it is low enough depending on the
 difference in height is accommodated by the size of the tube.
<p>
 This is essentially identical in concept to a mercury barometer.
<p>
 By using a valve at the closed end instead of a hard seal, pressure
 differences can be measured.
<p>
 A pair of these is actually adequate for the gas lasers being discussed:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>A coarse gauge using mercury for readings up to perhaps 100 Torr.
<p>
 <li>A fine gauge using diffusion pump oil for readings from 10 Torr to 0.1
  Torr (though viscosity/surface tension will require a bit of tapping to
  minimize error at the lower end of this range.
 </ul>
<p>
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahbmg">Home-built Closed-End
 Manometer Gauge</A> for details.
<p>
<li><b>McLeod gauge:</b> This is one example of a class of very clever gauges
 based only on low tech principles of hydraulics.  The second chapter ("More
 on the Helium-Neon Laser") in "Light and its Uses" has an extensive
 discussion on the construction of a gauge of this type which is quite
 adequate for our needs.
<p>
 Unlike the others, this is not automatic - it must be tilted and righted to
 read the pressure.  This action captures a precise quantity of the rarified
 atmosphere which can be balanced against a measured column of mercury.
 Its readings are independent of the type(s) gas in the system which is
 advantageous where gas fill is constantly changing.
 <A HREF="http://www.kontes.com/">Kimble/Kontes Glass Company</A> is one
 supplier.
<p>
<li><b>Thermocouple gauge:</b>  A tube or header has an electric heating
 element and thermocouple mounted in close proximity.  Since heat conduction
 is a strong function of gas pressure over the range of about 1 milliTorr to
 1 Torr, the temperature of a filament fed with a constant current will go
 up as pressure goes down.  The thermocouple is connected to a meter (possibly
 via an op-amp circuit) to provide a suitable readout.  The TC gauge is
 probably the most common type in common use for this pressure range
 and somewhat beyond at both ends.
<p>
 Since this is an indirect reading device, it must be calibrated against a
 known standard.  Constant voltage or constant temperature (sensing heater
 current for the readout) may also be used.  TC gauges are considered
 reliable but not particularly accurate, though if calibrated for the
 specific sensor and gas(es) being used, this can be improved considerably.
 There is much more information on TC gauges in the following sections.
<p>
<li><b>Thermistor gauge:</b>  The resistance of a thermistor element is a
 strong function of temperature with positive or negative temperature
 coefficient (PTC or NTC).  By sensing the voltage or current when the other
 is held constant, pressure will determine the response similar to the
 thermocouple gauge, above.  Thermistor gauges have no problem providing some
 sort of response all the way to atmosphere so a typical thermistor gauge may
 actually have two scales to cover the range from 1 micron to 760 Torr.  While
 the sensing element may be more robust than that of a thermocouple gauge, the
 response time may be slower, and calibration of thermistor elements may not
 be as well determined or consistent.
<p>
 However, a thermistor gauge can be built even less expensively than a
 thermocouple gauge since the sensor can also be a common thermistor if
 you have a reference vacuum gauge for calibration.  See
 <A HREF="http://www.ee.ualberta.ca/~schmaus/vacf/thermis.html">Thermistor
 Vacuum Gauge</A>.  This is from
 <A HREF="http://www.ee.ualberta.ca/~schmaus/vacf/">The Vacuum
 Technology Page (ECE Department, University of Alberta)</A>
 which has other related information.<p>
<p>
<li><b>Pirani gauge:</b> Two filaments (platinum alloy in the best gauges),
 act as resistances in two arms of a Wheatstone bridge. The reference filament
 is immersed in a fixed-gas pressure, while the measurement filament is exposed
 to the system gas.   A current through the bridge heats both filaments but
 like the thermocouple gauge, the temperature of the sensing filament will
 differ based on gas pressure.  The degree of bridge unbalance is a measure
 of pressure.  Any particular Pirani gauge has about the same dynamic range
 as a thermocouple gauge (1,000 to 10,000) but a particular model can go
 lower or higher in pressure, and they tend to have a much faster response.
<p>
<li><b>Ion gauge:</b> A constant electron current is passed between a heated
 filament cathode (negative) and anode (positive, called the grid for these
 sensors).  In the process, some gas molecules are ionized (positive ions)
 and these are attracted to a collector electrode which is maintained at
 ground potential.  The resulting ion current is a linear function of gas
 pressure in the high vacuum range - 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-8</sup> Torr
 and somewhat beyond.  Protection must be provided to prevent the filament from
 being energized if the gas pressure is too high as it may burn out (if there
 is oxygen in the mix).  Ion gauges are generally standard equipment for high
 vacuum systems but are expensive and not essential for our needs since they
 don't really work at the more modest range of vacuum we care about.  These
 also go by the name: "hot filament vacuum gauge".
<p>
<li><b>Capacitance manometer gauge:</b> A tensioned conductive diaphragm
 separates a reference pressure (usually a high vacuum in a sealed chamber)
 from the pressure being measured.  The position of the diaphragm with respect
 to a stationary metal surface forms a capacitor whose capacitance varies as
 function of the pressure difference.  Capacitance manometer gauges can
 operate over a wide range of pressure and readings are independent of
 gas composition.  While readout is electrical, these do sense pressure
 directly and can be quite accurate.  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacapm">The Capacitance Manometer Vacuum/Pressure
 Gauge</A>.
</ul>
<p>
There are many others including: cold cathode, convection, diaphragm manometer,
and Penning.  Some of the vacuum supplier Web sites like that of
<A HREF="http://www.lesker.com/">Lesker Vacuum Systems and Components</A>
have brief descriptions of the various vacuum gauge technologies.
<p>
Electronic vacuum gauges may have either analog (e.g., meter needle) or
digital readouts.  Digital gauges aren't necessarily more precise as they
are still limited by the sensing technique.  It's likely that many of them
use the same front-end circuitry but add an A/D converter and lookup table
before the display.  What's the point of 4 digit readout if the accuracy
of the underlying measurement is only 10 or 20 percent, as with a thermocouple
vacuum gauge?!  However, they do excel in the coolness factor. :)
<p>
CAUTION: Any serious arc or discharge that reaches the a vacuum gauge sensor
will likely ruin it and blow out portions of the control unit as well as the
operator if he/she happens to provide a convenient path to ground!  Means
should be provided to prevent this from occurring.  Metal plumbing in the
vicinity of the sensor(s) should be grounded!  Locating the sensors in regions
of the vacuum system away from electrical pyrotechnics would be highly
recommended!
<p>
All types of vacuum gauges are readily available, new, surplus, eBay, and
elsewhere.  However, before you grab the first one available, make sure it
comes with the necessary sensing head(s) - some of these are either expensive
or hard-to-impossible to obtain.  However, on places like eBay, it may be
cheaper to bid on the electronics separately from the sensor as the
complete systems sometimes go for more than the prices of their individual
parts!

<h3><A NAME="cvagtc">Thermocouple Vacuum Gauges</A></h3>

Thermocouple (TC) gauges operate at the lower end of the range in which we
are interested.  The most common ones provide useful readings between 1 Torr
and 1 milliTorr (1 micron) though some go as high as 100 Torr and as low
as 0.1 micron (but not with the same sensor).  However, the "best
sensitivity" range may be somewhat less as each end is a bit squished.
The TC gauge is among the most widely available, especially on the surplus
market or eBay.  However, keep in mind that a good deal on a controller
isn't that great if you have to pay full price for the compatible TC gauge
tube (sensor).  It seems that when vacuum systems are dismantled, the tubes
are often neglected and remain with the plumbing.  TC gauges with sensors
tend to go for about $50 to $100 on eBay, somewhat more from used vacuum
equipment companies.  The meter and electronics alone (without a sensor)
may go for only $10 or less on eBay depending on model, condition, and
luck. :)  However, when considering a unit in "as-is" condition, try to
get the seller to at least test the meter (instructions can be found below).
That's the part that unique with its specially calibrated scale and possibly
high (mV) sensitivity.
<p>
It is possible to build a TC gauge (readout) for next to nothing with parts
from a reasonably well stocked junk drawer but the sensors are still costly
(by scrounger standards) and the effort - despite the simplicity of the
circuitry - may not justify the money saved.  See the next section for my
experience doing this.  The article:
<A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/tcgauge.htm">Building a
Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge</A> also includes information on a home-made
version which can be constructed inexpensively.  It
also mentions the Pirani and thermistor gauges, which operate on similar
principles.

<A HREF="http://www.hastings-inst.com/">Teledyne Hastings</A> manufactures one
of the most popular line of thermocouple (TC) vacuum gauges and controllers.
See <A HREF="http://www.hastings-inst.com/products/p-vac.htm">Teledyne

has adjustable set-points to activate other equipment, alarms, etc., based
on pressure limits.  Note that in what follows, I use the term "control

Basic information on the Hastings TC sensors (they call these "thermopile
sensors") may be found on the

<p>
There are two common types of Hastings TC gauge sensors: Those using an AC
heater with a single thermocouple requiring a bridge circuit for readout
(the majority including the DV-3, DV-4, DV-5, DV-6, and DV-8) and those with
the heater and outputs combined (DV-23 and DV-24).  The first group bring out
a single connection for the thermocouple which is referenced to both ends of
the heater.  I currently do not have detailed information on the DV-23 and
DV-24 group except that they are used with Hastings' "Economy" line of vacuum
gauges and controllers despite appearing to have more sophisticated
construction with a slightly wider useful range at the high end than the
DV-3/DV-6 and DV-4, respectively.  If anyone has such info, please contact
me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.  (A third type of TC gauge sensor using either an AC or
DC heater with a pair of wires for the thermocouple is used by manufacturers
like Varian and Veeco.)  Some older samples of the DV-3M, DV-4D, DV-5M, DV-6M,
and DV-8M may not have the letter suffixes but are electrically equivalent
(e.g., DV-8 instead of DV-8M).  The two sets of DV-4s are not quite identical
but are close enough that they may usually be used interchangeably in a given
system requiring only a slight adjustment of heater current.  There is also
a DV-100 with a useful range from 0.1 to 100 Torr used with the NV-100
controller but I haven't found info on this other than the <A HREF=

<p>
Note: mT = mTorr = 10<sup>-3</sup> Torr = 1 micron of Hg.
<p>
All tubes in a given column are functionally equivalent and electrically
compatible, though the connectors may differ.  The top one (e.g., DV-4D)
is much more common and has a much lower list price than the others.
However, since the others aren't as well known and in less demand, it may be
possible to snag one (e.g., a DV-34) at a very low price from a surplus
dealer or auction.  A simple cable adapter is then all that is needed to
use it.
<p>
Not on this list are chart recorder readouts and controllers like the
MRV-6 for the DV-6M and similar TC gauge tubes.  With the availability of
cheap PC-based data acquisition, they are probably no longer available.
<p>
The DV-4AM and DV-4D series appear to be quite similar in performance.
The heater current is slightly different but from what I've seen, the
calibration appears to be almost the same, though if a meter face I have that
is supposedly for a DV-4AM is actually for a DV-4AM, the response might
be useful up to 50 Torr.  Other than the markings for 20 and 50 Torr,
the calibration looks about the same, so it might have just been a
liberty taken by the meter face designer. :)
<p>
CAUTION: DO NOT attempt to test TC gauge tubes for resistance or continuity
with an analog VOM - There may be enough current on its low ohms scale to burn
out the TC gauge tube heater.  Confirm that any DMM has a low enough current
on its resistance ranges by checking the user manual or measuring it with
another meter.  Similar precautions apply to the analog meter movements on
gauges and controllers.  Even a DMM will probably peg the meter needle on
those without active circuitry though permanent damage may not occur.
<p>
CAUTION: DO NOT mount a thermocouple gauge tube directly on the vacuum
pump even for testing as the vibrations may kill it.  The internal wiring
is mighty fine!  I haven't experienced a failure myself but have heard
of this happening.  I don't know if it was simply a tube about to die
anyhow or a real issue, but better to play safe.
<p>
Speaking of which, I don't have much confidence in the values given above for
TC gauge tube voltage and current.  In testing various Hastings TC gauge tubes,
I've found that the rated full scale output (which I do trust since that is
set by the meter movement current sensitivity and input resistance where there
is no amplifier) was achieved with a heater voltage slightly different than
the listed value.  A typical Hastings meter has a sensitivity of 250 uA
full scale and input resistance of 40 ohms (10 mV full scale).  Using a
readout with a greater input resistance may result in an output at high
vacuum which is significantly greater than spec.  Thus, if your gauges
uses an op-amp circuit rather than the Hastings meter, its input resistance
should be around this value.  This resistance can be used to tune the
sensitivity to some extent as well for a fixed heater current and meter
sensitivity (but I don't know at what point the calibration curve will be
affected enough to matter).
<p>
There are "A" and "B" versions of the common VT readouts and CVT
controllers (e.g., VT-6A or CVT-6B).  Both include cables for power and
the TC gauge tube, and control output (CVT only).  The "A" version is for
mounting on a panel in customer equipment; the "B" version is housed
in its own case with power switch.  As can be seen from the chart above,
many variations are/were available.  And, this labelling isn't entirely
consistent. :)
<p>
I have made meter face templates for the DV-4, DV-5, DV-6, DV-23, and
DV-24 TC gauge tubes based on graphics from the Hastings Web site for the
SV-1, VT-4, VT-5, VT-6, CVH-3, and CVH-4, respectively, but somewhat improved.
These are all the newer "flattened" style meters.
<p>
For the DV-8, I modified one of these based on my NV-8B as best I could by
eyeball. :)  (I don't actually know if there is/was an actual VT-8 gauge but
that's how I labeled it.  Note that unlike the others, the right-hand limit
of the VT-8 meter represents a substantial output from the thermocouple
because the scale is stretched to provide better resolution below 1 mTorr.
From my measurements of the NV-8B, 10 mTorr - the upper pressure limit of
the meter - corresponds to approximately 0.55 of the TC gauge tube voltage
at perfect vacuum.  In fact, the VT-5 meter scale looks like it should be
usable without an offset using the DV-8 tube as the DV-5 and DV-8 tubes are
quite similar in their response.)
<p>
For the DV-3, I used a photo of the meter from an SV-1. (And like the DV-8,
I don't actually know if there is/was an actual VT-3 gauge but that's how
I labeled it.)  This is the only one using the older style meter design.
<p>
The following templates may be useful for home-built TC gauges (see the next
two sections):

<p>
Modify the size of these as required for your meter, print out on high
quality opaque paper stock, and attach to your existing meter.  For normal
meters without a reversal circuit, they will first have to be mirrored
left-to-right with the text adjusted appropriately.
<p>
I have determined the approximate calibration curves for these tubes based
on their readout meter faces.  See the
section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacrph">Calibration Reference Points for
Hastings TC Gauge Tubes</A>).  However, this is only for air which is kind of
boring for laser filling work. :)  If anyone can provide information on
calibratoin for other gases, please contact me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.  The <A HREF=
"http://www.hastings-inst.com/Manual/Vacuum/103-0594_NV_100%20manual.pdf">
Hastings NV-100 Operation Manual</A> has some calibration information and
curves for various gases including most of those of interest for home-built
lasers.  However, the DV-100 sensor for this unit is not similar to any
of the DV tubes listed above so the information may not be of much use
unless using that tube.  What is obvious though is that the calibration
for gases other than air can be so different as to render the gauge totally
useless without the precise correction.
<p>
Select a tube which puts the operating pressure of
your intended home-built laser(s) within its "Best Sensitivity" range
if possible.  Wide range tubes like the DV-4D cover most gas lasers but may
not be as accurate or repeatable at any given pressure point compared to a
tube with a more limited range like the DV-3M.  However, almost any of these
models will be better than wild guesses! :)  However, as noted, the calibration
will be different where gases other than air are being pumped (as with most
gas lasers).

<h4><A NAME="cvacrph">Calibration Reference Points for Hastings TC Gauge
 Tubes</A></h4>

The following chart shows the output of the DV-3, DV-6, DV-4, DV-5, and DV-8
Hastings TC gauges tubes for most marked pressures within their operating
range.  These were obtained using my <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahtct">Hastings
TC Vacuum Gauge Test Widget</A> to drive the respective readouts and recording
the output voltages for each major tick mark (and some others as well)
on the meter face.  Each meter (except for the DV-8, see below) was first
adjusted with no input to put the needle on the middle zero mark.  Absolute
voltage readings were taken and then normalized so that 1.000 on the chart
corresponds to full scale (high vacuum) on the meter.
<p>
The readouts for the DV-3, DV-6, DV-4, and DV-5 are all direct reading low
impedance (Hastings) meters so the values should be fairly accurate.  However,
the DV-8 calibration was tested using the NV-8B which includes an amplifier
and there is something funny about the behavior of this unit.  There is a
significant offset current (which is normal based on its circuitry) that
confuses any readings of TC gauge tube output and the sensitivity seems
to be low by about a factor of two based on my interpretration of the
Hastings specs.  So, even though the DV-5 and DV-8 listings below agree fairly
closely over their common range, I am not entirely confident of the accuracy
of these numbers.  However, the NV-8B does appear to be working correctly
(consistent with its circuit design) and a quick test using my Pfeiffer
Duo 1.5A seems to indicate that the NV-8B with the DV-8M still measures
correctly.  See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahnv8b">Hastings
NV-8B Vacuum Gauge</A>.

<h4><A NAME="cvaichtc">Internal Construction of Hastings TC Gauge
 Tubes</A></h4>

Unlike what is typically shown in textbook diagrams on this topic, the
thermocouple and heater functions are combined in Hastings TC gauge tubes
(at least those with a separate "DC Output" pin).  And, there
are actually three TC junctions, not one as might be expected.  This
may have been done to improve the coupling between the heater and
thermocouple junctions and make the tube less susceptable to orientation
and temperature or at least in part to simplify manufacturing.  I guess
there are certain things that may forever remain ultimate mysteries of the
Universe. :)
<p>
The following wiring applies to the DV-3, DV-4, DV-5, DV-6, and DV-8
(and equivalent) Hastings TC gauge tubes:

             Pin 3 <-- TC Gauge Tube Heater ---> Pin 5

</PRE>
<p>
The heater is formed of a pair of thin wires connected between pins 3 and
8 (one half), and pins 5 and 8 (the other half).  The wires consist of two
sections joined with welds which are thermocouple junctions (TC1 and TC2).
A similar wire with a thermocouple junction (TC3) runs between pins 7 and 8
but carries only the signal current.  TC1 and TC2 are the actual "hot"
thermocouple sensors; TC3 is a "cold" thermocouple sensor and is there
to compensate for transient changes in ambient temperature.
<p>
The internal construction of the common Hastings TC gauges tubes was determined
by examining samples of the DB-17 and DB-18, which are reference tubes for the
DV-3 and DV-5 TC gauge tubes, respectively.  The outer cases on these can be
unscrewed exposing the tubes themselves which are enclosed in glass. :)
(Reference tubes are evacuated to a specific pressure and sealed.  They
can be plugged into their corresponding gauge or controller to check its
calibration.)  While the wiring of what's inside the tubes is identical, there
is a big difference in the size of everything.  On the DB-17/DV-3 whose heater
uses 0.037 watts, the wires are at least 15 mm long with a thickness
corresponding to AWG #36 to #38 wire.  On the DB-18/DV-5 whose heater uses
only 0.006 watts, the wires are less than 2 mm long (including the junction
approximately in the middle) and made of nearly invisibly fine wire.  I don't
know why the pin 8 connection is brought out but it might have something to
do with initial calibration or could just be for mechanical support.  The
reference tubes also have various resistors in series and/or across pins
3, 5, and 7, presumably to fine tune the calibration.  I wonder if these
are also present inside the sensor tubes so all tubes of the same model are
interchangeable without requiring any adjustments as claimed on the Hastings
product info even though the manuals for these gauges recommend tweaking
calibration whenever a tube is replaced!  (My tests also show significant
differences in the heater resistance of new supposedly identical DV-6M
tubes which could translate into different responses.  The two new DV-6M
tubes that I have tested did show small but significant differences in
response at high vacuum on my home-built SG-TC2 TC vacuum gauge.)
<p>
One quirk I have found with respect to at least the DB-18 is that the response
of the VT-5B readout when attached to the reference tube is much much faster
than with an actual DV-5M TC gauge tube.  I don't know if this is due to
construction differences, the enclosed versus open volume of the two tubes,
or something else.  My sample of the DB-17 has leaked so I can't test it
as-is but might crack the seal in the future, attach an extension tube,
and use it as a sensor instead of a reference. :)
<p>
(Portions of the following from: Sam Schwartz (Emale98@aol.com).)
<p>
The less common DV-23 and DV-24 TC gauges tubes have two sets of heater
connections.  The internal wires in the DV-23 are mounted differently than
in more popular type tubes. Instead of straight wires that connect at their
centers, the wires in the DV-23 are crossed loops where each loop  is one
type of wire connected to close spaced base pins.  Each wire is used as a
heater and the crossed combination forms a pair of thermocouples. It is
easy to see, that the two thermocouples are at the same potential. Very
Clever!
<p>
The Hastings manual for their "Economy Analog Vacuum Meters and Controllers"
(on their Web site) mentions "an equal number of cold junctions kept at
ambient temperature by heavy mounting studs".  The cold junctions could
be close to each pin with the hot junctions near the center of the star
but why make this thing so much more complex than the other types of Hastings
TC tubes and then use it in their "Economy gauges"?
<p>
Here are listed and measured resistances for a sample of the DV-23:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pins 2-4: 4.0 ohms (listed as 5 ohms).
<li>Pins 6-8: 5.3 ohms (listed as 6 ohms).

All odd number pins are isolated from any other pin.  These resistance
measurements are consistent with a star arrangement where the resistances
are as follows:
<p>
<PRE>

          2.125                   2.8
 Pin 2 o---/\/\----+          +---/\/\---o Pin 6
                   |  0-0.1   |

          1.875    |    X     |   2.5
 Pin 4 o---/\/\----+          +---/\/\---o Pin 8

</PRE>
<p>
The uncertainty is due to measurement error (so the value of X may be exactly
0 ohms) or the arrangement isn't at all like this!
<p>
Now for my description of the internals. Please follow the sketch and 
my description as follows: One type of wire loops from pin 2 to pin 4, while 
the second type of wire loops from pin 6 to pin 8 and the loops overlap and 
touch at their midpoints where there is an electrical as well as a thermal 
connection. The difference in measured values of the wires of the two loops 
is due to their different compositions. In other words, the resistance 
measured between pin 2 and pin 4 is different than that measured between pin 
6 and pin 8. However, if one takes half the resistance measured between pin 2 
and pin 6 and adds that ohmic quantity to half the resistance between pin 4 
and pin 8, the result is very close to the resistance between pins 2 and 8 
and also between pins 4 and 6.  Presto! It all checks and verifies the 
existence of the internal loops. 
<p>
Heaters are formed between pins 2 and 4 (one wire type) and also 
between pins 6 and 8 (the second wire type), while thermocouples are formed 
between between pins 2 and 8 and also between pins 4 and 6. Thus, there are a 
couple of thermocouples in parallel at their juncture. 

<h4><A NAME="cvasthtc">Simplest Hastings Thermocouple Gauge Readouts</A></h4>

These basic units consist of a zener regulated AC source, a stepdown
transformer, the TC gauge tube, and a DC millivoltmeter.  That's it!
Older units may use a small Sola constant voltage (ferro-resonant) transformer
for regulation rather than zeners but are otherwise similar.  While newer
higher quality systems usually are based on a transistor oscillator fed by a
well regulated power supply, and possibly an op-amp to condition the
thermocouple output, for many applications, this isn't essential.  Given the
inherent lack of accuracy of TC vacuum gauges, the improved stability may not
make much difference.
<p>
The schematics in <A HREF="thtcro1.gif">Simplest Hastings TC Readouts</A>
show the entire circuits for systems using the two types of Hastings TC
gauge tubes with zeners for regulation.  Except possibly for some part values,
the AC line circuitry is identical for all versions.  The stepdown transformer
runs on a 16 VAC (or other) low voltage input and produces the several hundred
mVAC needed for each type of TC gauge tube.  The meters are specially designed
to have a very low coil resistance to match the full scale output voltage of
the TC gauge tube (2, 10, or 13 mV depending on model).  Normal meter movements
will not work here which is why other manufacturers often use an op-amp circuit
to provide amplification.
<p>
More modern versions of VT readouts use a two transistor oscillator to power
the TC gauge heater.  Line voltage is preregulated by a resistor followed
by a surge suppressor to clip the peaks of the AC cycle, then
half-wave rectified and regulated down
to 6.8 VDC with a zener diode.  A typical schematic (courtesy of Teledyne
Hastings) for both the VT-4 and VT-6 is shown in:
<A HREF="vt46sch.gif">Hastings VT-4/VT-6 Readout Circuit</A> and in the next
section.  The VT-5 should be similar except for a 2 mV instead of 10 mV meter
(or amplifier).

<h4><A NAME="cvahcvtv">Hastings CVT Thermocouple Vacuum Controllers</A></h4>

The CVT-1X (X=4,5,6) models add a single set-point to an analog thermocouple
vacuum gauge readout (VT series).  Externally, the only difference is a much
deeper case, the red set-point pointer, black knob above the zero adjust screw
to set the set-point, and additional cable with 3 pin connector.  There are
versions for all the popular Hastings TC gauges sensors with readouts that are
identical to the equivalent VT series readouts.  The ones I've seen
use the basic two transistor oscillator to generate the TC gauge heater
voltage and a VT type low impedance meter for the readout. 
The calibration trimpot is accessible externally through a hole in the side
of the case.
<p>
The readout portion of the CVT controllers is essentially identical to the
circuitry in the corresponding VT readout.  The only electrical connections
between this and the set-point controller are the Hot and Neutral of the
AC line.  Thus, the set-point controller for all CVT-1X models should be
the same.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for CVT-16 in PDF format:
 <a href="thcvtsch.pdf">TH-CVT16-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The set-point is done with a "flag" attached to the back of the rotating
part of the meter movement that blocks light to a photocell at the set-point.
The knob actually moves the photocell via a set of gears so it tracks the
location of the set-point pointer.  The light source is an incandescent lamp
(!!) which illuminates a plastic screen of sorts behind the flag.  (For
replacement should this burn out, any common
lamp rated at 3 V or so including one for a 2-cell flashlight or
the miniature bulb in a Christmas tree light string should work
fine and alignment isn't at all critical.)
The output of the photocell is amplified to control a relay.  This is a crude
but effective arrangement as long as nothing needs to be repaired.  The only
adjustment is a set-screw to loosen one of the gears on its shaft so the
relative position of the red pointer and flag thing can be aligned.
The circuitry is certainly about as simple as imaginable (without using a
single chip!).  There isn't even a rectifier. :)
<p>
Unfortunately, being a partially mechanical system with small molded
plastic parts, tracking over the entire range may not be very good.
It can be set properly at a single point (usually it would be desirable
for this to be near the high vacuum end of the scale) but may be off 5
percent or more at the other end.  The response will be repeatable and
predictable but the switching point may not line up with the red pointer.
Given the inherent lack of accuracy of TC gauges in general, I suppose
this doesn't really matter but I think an electronic system like that
of the Lesker TCC-220 is superior.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvaa220">Adapting a Lesker TCC-220 to Use
a Hastings DV-6M TC Gauge Tube</A>.
<p>
There are also CVT-2X models (much less common) which have dual set-points,
a pair of set-point setting knobs and associated red pointers, and two
cables with 3 pin connectors.  Their construction is very similar to that
of the CVT-1X models.  The light source and meter flag are the same but
there are a pair of independently movable photocells whose outputs feed
separate amplifiers and relays.  The construction prevents the set-points
from crossing so the left knob's set-point must always be at a lower
pressure than that of the right knob.
<p>
This set-point/pointer calibration can be adjusted fairly easily.  Work ONLY
in a clean environment to prevent dust (particularly ferrous particles) from
getting into the meter movement!  Remove the three screws holding the aluminum
cover and pull it back only enough to reveal the brass pinion gear(s) attached
to the adjustment mechanism (1 for the CVT-1X, 2 for the CVT-2X) - about an
inch at most.  (Take care not to apply stress to the wiring since if any of
the wires breaks off, it's a royal pain to repair requiring removal of all
the strain reliefs in the back to get the thing apart.)  There is a very small
set-screw on the gear.  Loosening this allows the red pointer to move without
affecting the actual set-point.  DON'T touch it yet, just find the proper hex
wrench!
<p>
Adjustment is most easily done with a tester such as described in the
sections: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahtct">Hastings TC Vacuum Gauge Test
Widget</A> and <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahtst">Sam's Hastings TC Gauge
Tester 1</A>.  Either of these allows the meter needle to be positioned
at an arbitrary location by turning a knob.  A vacuum system is just a bit
inconvenient for this!  Using the tester, move the needle to the location
of the desired set-point that should be most accurate subject to the
condition that the set-screw be accessible.  (Minimize ambient light
falling on the back of the meter as this will make its way to the
photocell and affect calibration or even cause erratic behavior.
It's also best to make the adjustments with the meter in the same
orientation it will be used as this also affects calibration.)  While
listening for the relay click or monitoring the appropriate relay with
an ohmmeter, move the red pointer until it is approximately centered
between the on and off points of the relay (or at one or the other
if that's preferable for your needs).  Loosen the set-screw and
adjust the red pointer to be coincident with the meter needle.  Tighten
the set-screw.  With the CVT-2X, repeat for the other set-point.
Push the cover back in place (don't put the screws back yet) and with
the controller oriented the way it will be in your system, recheck
the calibration to make sure it didn't shift after tightening or due to
light affecting it during adjustment.  Now replace the screws. :)
<p>
It may also be possible to correct or at least improve the tracking over
the entire range by adjusting the position of the plastic bracket holding
the photocell(s) but the procedure is not intuitively obvious and reserved
for the advanced course. :)
<p>
A couple of precautions: The meter and case are not well sealed so dust
can get into the meter movement.  More serious on the CVT-1X models at least
is that the shaft of the press-fit knob on the front of the meter is easily
broken if something hits or falls on it, being made of thin plastic.  Should
this happen, don't be tempted to try and turn the stub with anything that goes
in the hole in the metal part (it doesn't turn with the knob anyhow, but is the
pivot).  On the CVT-1X, the suspension for the taut-band meter movement is
behind the hole (stupid design, why is there a hole?) and very easily damaged
(don't ask me how I found out!).  (The knobs on the CVT-2X models are on either
side and so don't have this risk.)  In either case, should a knob break, the
cover can be removed, and the shaft either Super-glued back together or
replaced.
<p>
I don't know if the newest version of the CVT controllers use the same design
as the ones I have but they do look physically similar except that the
red pointers are mounted behind the meter scale and only show through the
mirrored part, the connections are via terminal blocks instead of hard-wired
cables, and the Hastings logo is black and white instead of black and blue. :)

<h4><A NAME="cvahnv8b">Hastings NV-8B Vacuum Gauge</A></h4>

This is a basic readout using the DV-8M (or DV-31) TC gauge tube.  However,
unlike the others where the meter scale goes from 0 just beyond ATM to a maximum
value at high vacuum, its range is from 10 microns down to 0 microns (with the
best sensitivity range of the DV-8M from 10 microns to 0.1 microns).  This
portion of the scale looks virtually identical to the lower part of the VT-5
scale although the DV-5 and DV-8 TC gauge tubes are not quite the same.  I still
don't know why there are two types given their apparent similarities.  In any
case, due to the shifted scale, the NV-8B doesn't just use a low-impedance
meter movement connected to the TC gauge tube output but has active circuitry
using a precision op-amp (OP-07, ultra-low offset, low noise, ultra-stable
with time).  It also has a real voltage regulator (discrete) for the negative
supply which powers the TC gauge tube heater oscillator and op-amp V-,
and a two stage zener regulator for the positive supply which powers
op-amp V+.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for NV-8B in PDF format:
 <a href="thnv8sch.pdf">NV-8B-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
In addition to zeners for the required positive and negative power supplies,
there is an active regulator to further stabilize the power to the oscillator
that drives the TC heater.  That uses the by now very familiar two transistor
self oscillating transformer-based circuit generating around 320 mV RMS AC.
The CAL pot in series with the power to the oscillator is used to adjust the
actual voltage/current to the tube to calibrate the sensitivity of the meter
(the op-amp circuit has a fixed gain which appears to be about 550).  The
BIAS pot adjusts the meter offset.
<p>
However, the NV-8B is rather strange in the way it does the scale shifting.
The meter is a normal reading (left to right) movement rather than
the reversed ones used on most other Hastings TC gauges.  Therefore, it needs
to be driven off scale to the right for pressures above 10 microns and driven
backwards by the output of the TC gauge tube at lower pressures.  But
rather than doing this by adding a fixed current into the op-amp summing
node, the NV-8B introduces a current into the tube circuit itself, adjusted
by the BIAS pot.  Thus, attempting to measure the tube output voltage (spec'd
at 2 mV at high vacuum) is not possible.  The only place where this voltage
range exists (at least approximately) is at the input to the amplifier
circuit which I measured to be 0 mV at high vacuum and 1.83 mV at 10 microns.
But, the input at ATM is about 3.8 mV which doesn't make sense if the entire
range of the tube is only 2 mV!  Perhaps the Hastings specs really mean
that the total range from 10 microns to high vacuum is a difference of 2 mV.
The unit appears to work correctly and consistently with the schematic and
when tested on my Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A so this remains somewhat of a mystery. :)
<p>
Note that there is no similarity in operation of the NV-8B and NV-100.  The
latter uses a feedback loop to maintain a constant temperature rather
than the constant current/voltage of the NV-8B and all the other Hastings
TC vacuum gauges.  (This is why the NV-100 has a useful range up to
100 Torr.)  Thus any similarity of model numbers is strictly coincidental.

<h4><A NAME="cvahavcm">Hastings TC Gauge AVC Controller with Mod 4/6 Digital Readout</A></h4>

The AVC (Active Vacuum Control) controller (OK, so it's redundant!) is a
compact module that mates with either a DV-6M or DV-4D thermocouple vacuum
gauge sensor.  It is about 3 inches long and 1.25 inches in diameter
with an octal socket at one end and the 6 wire cable to the readout exiting at
the other end.  It contains the TC heater drive, sensor preamp, and set-point
comparator.
<p>
The Mod 4/6 power supply/readout is a 1/4 DIN-size unit with a 4 digit
LED display.  It provides power for the AVC module and the A/D converter
for the sensor input or set-point voltage.  Its microprocessor converts
from sensor voltage to Torr or mBar for either the DV-6M or DV-4D (or
equivalent) TC gauge tube, includes user calibration capability,
and open collector set-point outputs.
<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.teledyne-hi.co.kr/pdf/Mod4_6.pdf">Teledyne Hastings
Model AVC Controller with Mod 4/6 Power Supply</A> for general info and
<A HREF=
"http://www.teledyne-hi.com/Manual/Vacuum/148-0598_Model_4_6%20manual.doc">
Hastings Mod 4/6 Digital Vacuum Instrument Operation Manual</A> for
more detailed information.
<p>
This setup is very easy to use and generally works as described in the
manual.  Switching between DV-4D and DV-6M TC gauge tubes is very easy
as long as the factory (default) calibration is considered close enough.
More accurate calibration to the specific gauge tube requires being able
to hold a vacuum at the lower and upper limits for that tube (i.e., 0.010
and 20 Torr for the DV-4D, or 1 and 1000 microns for the DV-6M).
However, one anomaly would seem to be rather
fundamental: There is also a way to use a single point calibration to
get the low end to be accurate (which is usually sufficient for most
applications).  For this, the appropriate TC reference tube is used
and the Pmin pot is adjusted on the AVC module until the reading matches
what it printed on the reference tube.  Since the Pmin pot on the AVC
module is an analog adjustment and the Mod 4/6 has no way of being
aware of its actual setting, this will also change the factory default
calibration.  And, the Pmin pot also affects the calibration of the other type
of TC gauge tube if switching to that.  I measured the heater voltage
across pins 3 and 5 of the TC gauge tube and Pmin changes that, so it's
setting the heater current, like the calibration pot in the analog VT
readout or CVT controller.  None of this is mentioned
in the manual!  In addition, it also doesn't appear that changing
TC gauge tube types actually changes the heater current automatically,
so they may not be operating under optimal conditions, though any
difference is probably minor.
<p>
As a side note, the frequency of the heater drive was shown as 28.8 kHz
on my Fluke 87.  This seems rather high but everything is close together
and the oscillator transformer is fairly small.
<p>
I believe that the best way to calibrate this setup would be the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Plug the AVC module into the desired TC gauge tube.
<p>
<li>Select the proper type of TC gauge tube (DV-4C or DV-6C as shown on
 the display) and then reset to the default factory settings (instructions
 in the manual).
<p>
<li>Pump down to a vacuum of approximately 0.010 Torr (DV-4D) or 10 microns
 (DV-6M) using a separate calibrated vacuum gauge for reference.  The exact
 pressure isn't critical as long as it can be read accurately with the other
 gauge.  +10/-0 percent is probably close enough.
<p>
<li>Adjust the Pmin pot on the AVC module to match the vacuum reading on
 the accurate gauge.
<p>
<li>Increase the pressure until it is at exactly 20 Torr (DV-4D) or
 1000 microns (DV-6M).  Since the Mod 4/6 calibration assumes one of these
 values, the pressure must match one of these values.
<p>
<li>Follow the instructions in the manual to set the Cal.H parameter
 in the Mod 4/6.  Do not change the Cal.L parameter.
</ol>
<p>
The digital Mod 4/6 controller does make swapping TC gauge tubes and setting
calibration very easy, but the resolution is quite limited over parts of the
range.  For example, with the DV-6M, from 0.1 Torr to 0.001 Torr, the readout
is simply in integer microns (e.g., .015 for 15 microns).  So, a trend in
pressure is not as evident as with an analog meter needle, especially near
the bottom.  Even if the pressure reading isn't accurate, the trend can still
be seen for changes as small as 0.1 micron using an analog meter.
I don't know whether this is deliberate or simply a result of the
limited number of bits in the A/D converter.
Also, below 0.010 Torr (DV-4D) or 1 micron (DV-6M), the Mod 4/6 simply
displays "ur" for "underrange", which may not be entirely useful. :)

<h4><A NAME="cvathtrb">Troubleshooting Hastings TC Vacuum Gauges</A></h4>

This section is written specifically for gauges or controllers using Hastings
TC gauge tubes but should apply to other thermocouple vacuum gauges as well.
<p>
Where the meter response doesn't come close to anything expected AND the
vacuum system is known to be operating properly, the following should help
to identify the problem.  If the problem occurred after an "event" like a
major arc inside the vacuum system, both the TC gauge tube and controller
may be toast.  Where the calibration is off slightly, the sensor may be
contaminated.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Check power to the gauge or controller.  Some are battery powered and
 dead batteries are possible believe it or not. :)
<p>
<li>Use a true RMS reading multimeter to measure the voltage across the TC
 gauge tube heater (between pins 3 and 5 for the DV-3, DV-4, DV-5, DV-6, and
 DV-8; between pins 2 and 4, and 6 and 8 for the two heaters of the DV-23 and
 DV-24).  It should be fairly close to the values listed in the TC gauge tube
 specs (perhaps +/- 10 percent, see the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvathtc">Specifications of Teledyne Hastings
 Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge Tubes</A>).  If very low, tube may be
 shorted or something is wrong with the driver circuit; if very high, part or
 all of TC tube heater may be open or the regulator inside the driver may be
 faulty.  If testing without a TC gauge tube installed, substitute a load
 resistor equal to the spec'd heater resistance of the tube.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>On units with a line power transformer, capacitors/resistors/zeners, and
  a final stepdown transformer to the TC gauge tube, it should be a simple
  matter to locate the bad part(s) with a multimeter.
<p>
 <li>On units with a Sola constant voltage power transformer for regulation,
  a shorted resonating capacitor will result in almost no output and is
  a common failure.  Of the three Hastings gauges of this type that I've
  acquired, one had a shorted cap and another had had the cap replaced in the
  past.  WARNING: There may be more than <i>250 VAC</i> across the cap when
  it is working properly!  Take care in making measurements.
<p>
 <li>On units with a transistor oscillator, first check the rectifier,
  resistor, and zener in the line input circuit, as well as the two
  electrolytic caps.  If the caps are bad (as is common with older units),
  there may still be some output but calibration will be off due to ripple
  Use an oscilloscope, if available, to check for a clean waveform at the
  TC gauge tube socket.
 </ul>
<p>
<li>Using only a DMM known to use a low current on its ohms ranges, check the
 resistance of the TC gauge tube heater(s).  Most DMMs are safe for TC gauge
 tubes but many or most VOMs will blow out the heater instantly on their low
 ohms range.  The reading should be within 20 percent of the value(s) listed
 in the TC gauge tube specs.  An open is obviously bad.  A much lower value
 than spec'd may be the result of contamination so cleaning the inside of
 the tube with a safe solvent may be necessary.  If that doesn't help,
 some conductive material from your vacuum process may have coated the heater
 and the tube will need to be replaced.
<p>
<li>Using a DC mV meter, measure the output voltage of the TC gauge tube
 at high vacuum.  This will be between pin 7 and the heater transformer
 centertap for the DV-3, DV-4, DV-5, DV-6, and DV-8; or between the two heater
 transformer centertaps for the DV-23 and DV-24.  The reading should be close
 to 10 mV for the DV-3, DV-4, and DV-6; 2 mV for the DV-5; and 13 mV for the
 DV-23 and DV-24.  For the DV-8, the spec is 2 mV but it won't be possible
 to measure this with the tube attached to a gauge like the NV-8B.  See the
 section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahnv8b">Hastings NV-8B Vacuum Gauge</A>.
<p>
<li>Unplug the TC gauge tube and carefully apply a test voltage to the meter
 input.  See: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahtct">Hastings TC Vacuum Gauge Test
 Widget</A>.  Except for gauges and controllers using the DV-8, the meters are
 linear with 0 mV at one end and the rated full scale value at the other.
 For the DV-8, there is an offset but the readout should still respond.
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvahnv8b">Hastings NV-8B Vacuum
 Gauge</A>.
<p>
<li>If you have a known working TC gauge tube, it should be safe to try it
 at this point.  If the gauge now works properly, the original tube is at
 fault and may need a cleaning at the very least.  Pump oil from backstreaming
 or direct contact from a suck-in will affect calibration, possibly quite
 significantly.  The vacuum process itself may also result in contamination.
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvacvgs">Cleaning Vacuum Gauge
 Sensors</A>.
</ul>
<p>
Keep in mind that TC vacuum gauges are generally reliable but not
necessarily that accurate.  Despite what the manufacturers claim, the
sensitivity of individual samples of the same model TC gauge tube
does vary and calibration is a good idea whenever one is replaced.
When this is done, accuracy for a clean vacuum environment pumping
air only, should improve significantly.  However, pumping gases
other than what was used for calibration and/or
contamination on the TC gauge sensor will degrade
this very easily.  Where a readout device
(e.g., meter or digital display) other than the original is
substituted, check its input resistance as this significantly
affects the sensitivity when directly connected to a TC gauge
sensor.  If the resistance is too high, adjustment may be possible
by simply adding a (variable) resistor in parallel with the input.
Also note that the electronic regulation of the readout will
affect calibration, generally at the high-vacuum end of
the scale where it is most critical.  Adding an IC regulator
to any of the gauges can essentially eliminate that as a source
of error.

<h4><A NAME="cvasgtc1">Sam's Home-Built Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge 1
 (SG-TC1)</A></h4>

I decided to construct my own ThermoCouple (TC) vacuum gauge after seeing the
prices of new units (check out the Hastings Web site!) and the final bid
prices eBay of used ones.  However, in retrospect, I'd really recommend
buying a used gauge if the price is less than half of the price for an
equivalent new one.  It simply wasn't worth the time
and effort even though my total cost was under $25.  That was entirely for 
the never used <A HREF="http://www.hastings-inst.com/">Teledyne Hastings</A>
DV-3M TC gauge tube I did find on eBay for less than half the price of the
same thing from Duniway Stockroom (DST-01M).  In addition, I still need to
calibrate the gauge and paint the meter face to reflect its new life as a
vacuum gauge instead of a multimeter.  I now have a meter scale for the
DV-3 but will still probably never get around to it because after
constructing SG-TC1 and modifying it to become SG-TC2, I've acquired
more than enough commercial (mostly Hastings) readouts and controllers
to handle my TC vacuum gauge needs for the next 100 years or so. :)
<p>
The first control unit I built is based loosely on the Electronic Bell Jar
article <A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/tcgauge.htm">Building a
Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge</A>.  However, for the type of tube I used, that
design has to be modified slightly for two reasons: (1) the Hastings TC gauge
tube only provides a single sense output for the thermocouple rather than two
(which I didn't realize at first, see below) and (2) I wanted to use a single
supply (9 V battery) for the op-amp.  For the latter, I used a pair of
resistors to create a virtual ground - not terribly stable as the ground
shifts about 1 V between 0 and full scale on the meter but adequate for this
not very demanding application.  Almost any garbage op-amp can be used that
will run from a single 7 to 9 V supply and source at least 0.5 mA.  There is
nothing special about the TL082 except that it was found in my junk drawer. :)
However, some other common op-amps may not work reliably on the low voltage
single ended power supply used in SG-TC1.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for SG-TC1 in PDF format:
 <a href="sgtc1sch.pdf">SG-TC1-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The tube is attached to the meter circuit via an 8 conductor cable (only 3 are
actually needed).  A separate wire is used to connect the metal case of the
tube and plumbing to earth ground minimizing any effects of from RF or other
electrical discharges in the vacuum system on the gauge electronics.  (Neither
the sensor nor the electronics would likely survive any serious arc!)
<p>
The system includes a select switch for vacuum or TC heater (filament) current
setting, AC null and offset adjustments for the op-amp and thermocouple, and
internal gain adjustments for heater current and TC output.
<p>
While I was able to obtain the basic specifications for the DV-3M, it wasn't
clear how to sense the output as only a single pin was listed for the "DC
connection" (unlike the pair of pins for both tubes described in the Bell
Jar article).  Also, the heater is spec'd as AC rather than DC.
<p>
I found another pin that has continuity to it and assumed that
was the return but when wired that way, only got about 2 percent of the
expected output voltage.  After contemplating the meter's utter and total
lack of cooperation for awhile, I concluded that the thermocouple junction
was between the centertap of the heater and the listed pin, and the return
would have to be to both ends of the the heater.  So I added a 4.7 ohm
resistor to each end of the heater with their common point as the return
forming a bridge circuit which will pass the millivolt level DC thermocouple
output while cancelling out the AC heater voltage:

                    TC Gauge Tube Heater
</PRE>
<p>
It turns out that the actual wiring inside these tubes differs slightly from 
the diagram but it's close enough for government work. :)  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvaichtc">Internal Construction of Hastings TC Gauge
Tubes</A>.
<p>
If the ratio Ra:Rb is exactly equal to the ratio Rc:Rd, the TC Output
will have no AC component; if the ratios are close, there will be some AC but
as long as the peaks don't result in the op-amp exceeding its linear range,
they will be ignored by the DC meter.  Apparently, it was close enough because
even without an AC null adjustment (as shown in the schematic), the gauge
started to work as expected.  Note that this could also have been done by
removing the 56 ohm series resistor to the op-amp (-) input and using a 250
ohm pot instead of the 10 ohm pot shown.  I decided to leave it alone since
as they say: "If it works, use it." :)
<p>
The diodes across the meter protect it from overload; the capacitor slows
down its response so the needle doesn't go banging back and forth when
flipping "Meter Select" (S2).
<p>
As in keeping with my "if I have it in my junk box, why buy it" approach to
project construction, the power supply was from a dead electronically
controlled coffee maker (partly because it already had the relay used to
control power to the op-amp) and the meter was from an ancient RCA VTVM which
I picked up for $1 at a garage sale (which is nice and big but of course,
not labeled in any useful units).  It's installed in a nearly pristine
aluminum Minibox(tm) from an unidentified past project.  The only thing I
had to actually buy was the TC gauge tube.  Everything else was, well, just
laying around taking up space. :)
<p>
The adjustment procedure (below) is the same for both SG-TC1 and SG-TC2 (in
the next section) though the setting of the "I Adj." pot should never need to
be touched after initial setup for SG-TC2.
<p>
The same basic design will work for all Hastings TC gauge tubes (and
other manufacturers equivalents) except the DV-23/24/43/44 which have a
different internal configuration (see the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvasthtc">Simplest Hastings Thermocouple Gauge
Readouts</A>.)  However, changes in resistor values will be needed to
accommodate the differences in heater current and thermocouple sensitivity.
<p>
CAUTION: Installing any TC gauge tube other than the DV-3 series on SG-TC1
without modification will probably blow the tube instantly due to excessive
heater current.  Other Hastings TC gauge tubes use only 1/6th to 2/5ths the
heater current of the DV-3 and would not survive since SG-TC1 is essentially a
constant current source.  Conversion is very straightforward but not automatic!
<p>
A suitable vacuum pump will obviously be needed.  A Bourdon tube or similar
coarse vacuum gauge and TC (or other) gauge covering the relevant range
(especially at the low end) that is calibrated are highly desirable.
My test setup consisted of a Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A two stage rotary vane vacuum
pump, Bourdon tube vacuum dial gauge indicating 0 to 30 inches of mercury,
the DV-3M TC gauge tube, and a glass tube RF discharge widget as described
below.  Flexible thick wall PVC tubing connected the pump to a pair of brass
"Ts" for the dial gauge and TC gauge tube.  A hose pinch-off clamp enabled
the pump to be isolated from everything else.  A needle valve to admit air
at a controlled rate would have been highly desirable but I didn't have one.
<p>
In order to set some of the adjustments, the system should be pumped
down to below 1 micron (or as low as your vacuum pump will achieve, 5 or 10
microns is probably more realistic for a two stage rotary vane mechanical pump
that isn't brand new).  Without a calibrated vacuum gauge, an adequate vacuum
may be indicated by using a low power RF source (e.g., small transmitter,
hand-held Tesla/Oudin coil, flyback oscillator, etc.) to excite the residual
gas inside a glass tube.  For air, the glow discharge will go through a range
of colors including bright red, pink, white, blue-white, darker blue-white,
and eventually disappear once the pressure is below a few microns.  A well
maintained two stage pump should be able to achieve this.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvasrf">Sam's RF Discharge Color and Intensity Vacuum
Test</A>.  The glow discharge also aids in clearing the tube of contaminants
and reducing the time to achieve a decent vacuum - the pressure will rise
while the RF is turned on if there is still still stuff to be released from
the tube walls.
<p>
CAUTION: To avoid unsightly burnouts, before attaching the TC gauge
tube, set the front panel "I Adj." to min and use an AC mA meter (true RMS
if available) in series with a 2 ohm resistor (for the DV-3M) to confirm
that the heater current is below the rated value for the tube.  A "breakout
box" consisting of male and female connectors with test points and jumpers
would come in handy for making measurements with the TC gauge tube installed.
<p>
Originally, I had based the calibration precedure on the listed values
for TC gauge heater voltage and current in the Hastings datasheet.  However,
the new calibration procedure is based on achieving a full scale output from
the TC gauge tube of exactly 10 mV (for the DV-3).  I've found a small but
significant discrepency for some tubes and trust the full scale output more.
This is because Hastings vacuum gauges do not use amplification but just
special meter movements which are accurately calibrated to the full scale
value with no adjustments.  Hastings gauges and controllers provide a trim pot
for the heater voltage to set full scale sensitivity.  In addition, this
approah avoids the problems of measuring currents in very low voltage circuits
as well as slight errors in RMS readings of non-sinusoidal waveforms.
<p>
Note that the input resistance of the readout also affects the calibration.
The input resistance of 56 ohms used in SG-TC1 and SG-TC2 seems to be close
to optimal for the DV-3 and DV-6 tubes though it may not be the same as the
Hastings meter input resistance.  (The only one I measured was around 40 ohms
but that was a meter for a DV-4D TC gauge tube.)
<p>
The procedure which follows first calibrates the op-amp and TC gauge meter
circuit, and then adjusts TC gauge tube heater current for a full scale reading
at high vacuum.  It applies to both SG-TC1 and SG-TC2 except as noted.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Switch on the TC gauge but temporarily disable the heater supply by
 disconnecting power to the transformer driver circuit.
<p>
<li><b>Offset:</b> Set to 0 on the meter.  Once this is done, reconnect
 the heater supply.
<p>
<li>Start the vacuum pump(s) and allow the system to pump down to below 1
 micron (or as low as it will go).
<p>
<li><b>I Adj. pot:</b> Using a true RMS reading multimeter on its AC mV
 range (or lowest ACV range), set "I Adj." for about 275 mVAC (for the DV-3M)
 across the TC gauge tube heater.  (This is slightly lower than the value
 listed in the DV-3M datasheet but will be safe for the tube for initial
 calibration.)  It will take a minute or two for the voltage (and current)
 to stabilize, be patient.
<p>
<li>Using a multimeter on its DC mV range (or lowest DCV range), measure the
 output of the TC gauge tube at the input to the op-amp.  Slowly turn
 "I Adj." (probably up) to obtain a reading of exactly 10 mV (for the DV-3,
 assuming your pump goes low enough).  Be patient, there will be a delay!
<p>
 CAUTION: If the output of the TC gauge tube isn't near 10 mV at a TC heater
 voltage of 300 mVAC (or at least in the expected range depending on how good
 a vacuum you have), power down the system and find out why!
<p>
<li><b>TC Cal.:</b> Set so the TC gauge meter needle moves to the proper
 reading (10 mV for full scale, 9 mV for 0.9 of full scale, etc., depending
 on the ultimate vacuum of your system).
</ol>
<p>
Alternatively, a DC power supply or battery and a voltage divider in
place of the TC gauge tube can be used to set "Offset" and "TC Cal.".
This may be easier if the vacuum system isn't capable of pumping down
far enough.  In that case, it will be necessary to use some other means
of estimating actual pressure to set "I Adj.".  CAUTION: If your vacuum
system's lowest pressure is totally unknown, take care not to set the TC
gauge tube heater voltage or current too high!  Monitoring the voltage
(which is easier) at all times during the adjustment procedure is a good
idea.
<p>
Another way of doing the calibration is to use the exact heater voltage
and full scale output values from the Hastings datasheet but provide a
way of adjusting the input resistance of the op-amp circuit.  For example,
rather than using a 56 ohm input resistor and 5.6K ohm feedback resistance
to obtain a gain of 100 as in SG-TC1 and SG-TC2, make them 100 ohms and
1K ohm, respectively, and provide an adjustable 500 ohm resistor to analog
ground (not the op-amp virtual ground) to calibrate the overall TC gauge
sensitivity.
<p>
The following steps are really only needed for SG-TC1:
<p>
<ol start=7>
<li>Set the Meter Select switch to the "Iset" position (with the system
 remaining pumped down to below 1 micron):
<p>
<li>Adjust "I Cal." for exactly a full scale reading on the TC gauge meter.
<p>
 For SG-TC1, since the heater current isn't regulated, flip Meter Select
 back to "Vacuum" and confirm that the reading is the same and thus the AC
 line voltage hasn't changed in the previous 3 milliseconds. :)  Changes in
 heater current will mostly impact readings at the high vacuum-end of the range
 - those in the middle (100s of microns) won't be affected that much.
</ol>
<p>
The response of these tubes going from higher pressure to lower pressure
(as well as when first turned on or with changes in heater current)
is quite sluggish - allow 10 or 20 seconds for the reading to settle for the
DV-3; a few <i>minutes</i> for the DV-5 and DV-8.  Going from lower pressure
to higher pressure is much faster - by a factor of 10 or more.
<p>
Keep in mind that TC vacuum gauges are NOT precision instruments - even with
everything adjusted perfectly, accuracies of 10 or 20 percent at best are to
be expected.  Although the DV-3M can be used between 1 and 1,000 microns, its
best accuracy will be in the 20 to 200 micron range.  (Other model TC gauge
tubes cover ranges from 0.1 micron to 10, 20, or even 50 Torr.)  And, totally
different calibration will be needed if what is being pumped isn't plain old
air.
<p>
I later hooked up my Welch 1402 to the test setup and confirmed that it
achieved an even better vacuum than the Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A, impressive
considering it was using a combination of its old oil and the oil from a
well worn refrigeration service pump.
<p>
Note that if a proper low impedance milliammeter had been available, the
control circuit could be much simpler, without any active devices at all.
Such a circuit used to be on the Duniway Web site but has disappeared.  See
<A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/vacuum/tcgmanual.pdf">Copy of Duniway TCG
Instruction Manual</A>.  However, I wanted to use a meter movement I already
had and it wouldn't have responded more than 1/25th of full scale
at the maximum output of the TC gauge tube. :)  The circuit in the manual
also includes some regulation on heater current - not perfect, but better
than nothing.

<h4><A NAME="cvasgtc2">Sam's Home-Built Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge 2
 (SG-TC2)</A></h4>

After becoming annoyed by the fluctuations in heater current resulting from
power line voltage variations, and inspired by the two commercial TC gauges
I'd acquired, I modified SG-TC1 to use an oscillator powered from a regulated
source.  SG-TC2 may also be set up to use either a DV-3 or DV-6 TC gauge tube
from the front panel.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for SG-TC2 in PDF format:
 <a href="sgtc2sch.pdf">SG-TC2-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
An astable multivibrator drives a step-down transformer to power the TC
gauge tube filament.  I rewound the vertical output transformer from a mono
video display terminal.  Any small E-I or toroidal core should be suitable
(this was an E-I core about 1" square) and at the operating frequency of
around 500 Hz, either laminated iron or ferrite will be acceptable - a test
of both types showed virtually no difference in waveforms.  The primary and
secondary were each wound "bifilar style" (wires in pairs) so the two halves
of each winding have exactly the same number of turns.  Insulating tape was
put between them (mainly for appearance - this is low voltage so there should
be no problem with insulation breakdown!).  The capacitor in the snubber
across the collectors of the driver transistors was selected to result in
just detectable overshoot with the highest resistance TC gauge tube
heater to be used (tested with a dummy load).  This value will depend on the
actual oscillator frequency, parasitic winding characteristics of the
transformer, and load resistance.
<p>
The regulated voltage powers the oscillator directly and the transformer
drivers through a 200 ohm locking 10 turn pot, which replaced the single
turn front panel "I Adj." pot.  This provides enough range to accomodate
the DV-3 and DV-6 (as well as the DV-4, though the meter scale would be
totally different).  I also decided to add a voltage doubler and zeners to
provide regulated +/-5.1 VDC sources for the op-amp since the oscillator
voltage was somewhat marginal.  And, I wanted an excuse to get rid of the
fake ground. :)
<p>
The initial setup procedure for SG-TC2 is almost the same as for SG-TC1
but the "I Adj." adjustment consists of two parts: "I Coarse" (the voltage
regulator) and "I Fine" (formerly "I Adj.", front panel).  "I Fine" should
be set fully clockwise and then "I Coarse" should be set for the DV-3
gauge tube current (by measuring the output as described above) since this
tube requires the most current.  There is no "AC Null" adjustment -
if the number of turns on each half of the windings of
T2 are equal, the only ripple at the output of the op-amp will be due to
the unequal resistances in the two halves of the TC gauge heater.  This can
be checked with an oscilloscope or AC meter that blocks DC.  If less than
1 volt p-p, don't worry about it. (For my DV-3M, it was only 0.1 V p-p.)
Nothing is perfect and the bit of dither may help a meter with sticky
bearings. :)  The op-amp has plenty of head-room.  Or, for the purist,
a capacitor can be added in parallel with the resistor in the feedback
path of the op-amp to implement a low pass filter.  Of course, the
"Iset" position of the Meter Select switch is just for confirmation
as the TC gauge heater current should never need to be adjusted
after this for the remainder of the lifetime of the existing
Universe unless the TC gauge tube is replaced.  The meter switch
does serve a purpose - filling the otherwise empty hole in the front
panel. :)
<p>
Since SG-TC2 outputs a more or less constant voltage for the TC gauge tube
heater instead of a more-or-less constant current as with SG-TC1, it will
work for other Hastings TC gauge tubes having the same internal wiring except
the DV-5 without any circuit changes to the heater current supply.  This is
because the heater voltage specs are relatively close to each other.  For
the DV-4 and DV-6 only adjustments for heater current (front panel I Adj.)
will be required.  However, the DV-5's voltage is much lower so the adjustment
range may not be adequate (but a 1k ohm "I Adj." pot or additional series
resistor would take care of that).  For tubes other than the DV-3, the meter
reading for the "Iset" position of the Meter Select switch won't be exactly
full scale but can be recorded as an aid in initial calibration.
In addition, for the DV-5 and DV-8, the op-amp circuit will need to be modified
to have 5 times the gain since the high vacuum output of these tubes is only 2 mV
rather than the 10 mV for the DV-3, DV-4, and DV-6.  A gain switch could certainly
be added. :)
<p>
I have confirmed that the DV-6M is compatible with my home-built control unit
requiring only adjustment of the heater current and atm offset.  The
calibration curve between atm and high vacuum is probably a bit different
(the DV-6 is probably more stretched out at the high vacuum end) but since
I haven't yet painted the scale, it won't matter. :)
<p>
CAUTION: Do not install a TC gauge tube other than the one that SG-TC2 (or
SG-TC1) has been set up for without making sure the heater current is less
than the spec'd value for the new tube.  Failing to do this may result in
instant destruction of the tube by blowing the heater!  Approaches include
the use of a dummy load for the heater of the proper resistance and/or
powering the control unit with a Variac and starting low while monitoring
AC heater current or voltage.
<p>
It turns out that the design of SG-TC2 is quite similar to that of the Hastings
NV-100 TC controller for the DV-100 TC gauge tube.  I'd have almost thought
they copied the power supply, oscillator/driver, and sense amplifier circuitry
from SG-TC2 except that the NV-100 predates it by many years.  (The NV-100 does
one thing differently though: It maintains the DV-100 heater at a constant
temperature (within a limited current range) rather than using constant voltage
or current.  This might be bad for TC gauge tubes other than the DV-100.)
See that schematic in the <A HREF=
"http://www.hastings-inst.com/Manual/Vacuum/103-0594_NV_100%20manual.pdf">
Hastings NV-100 Operation Manual</A>.  I guess they could have used a time
machine to look at my circuit. :)

<h4><A NAME="cvaahtcg">Assorted TC Gauge Tubes, Readouts, and
 Controllers</A></h4>

Since constructing SG-TC1, I have acquired a variety of
Hastings TC gauge tubes including two new DV-6M tubes for less than half
the usual price.  The DV-6M uses a much lower power heater, has slightly better
sensitivity below 20 milliTorr, and a somewhat faster response than the DV-3M
(which is no longer manufactured), but is otherwise similar.  I obtained
a third apparently new in box DV-6M along with my CVT-26 (see below).  Others
I've obtained used, but working, include a pair of DV-4AMs, a DV-5M, and
another DV-3M.  I purchased a surplus but new in box DV-8M to go along with
my NV-8B readout.  I also have several new DV-34 TC gauge tubes.  These are
the high temperature (stainless steel/ceramic) version of the DV-4D.
<p>
I have also obtained the following TC gauge readouts (control units) and
vacuum controllers, mostly from eBay at an average price of less than $20
each including shipping.  Some of them required minor rehabilitation, both
electronic and cosmetic:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hastings SV-1R control unit.</b> This unit uses a small Sola constant
 voltage (ferro-resonant) transformer for regulation rather than zener diodes
 or a transistor oscillator fed from a regulated DC supply.  I had to replace
 the resonating capacitor as it was shorted resulting in almost no heater
 voltage.  A shorted cap is apparently a common failure with this design as
 one of the other units I obtained using this approach had had its cap
 replaced in the past.  The meter also required some tender loving care
 to remove flakes of plating or paint or something that was causing it
 to stick.  When I acquired this unit, I thought it used a DV-3 tube
 because that's what the SV-1 uses according to my chart from Hastings.
<p>
 The SV-1R is a rack-mount unit and I assumed that was what the "R" meant,
 everything else being identical.  A photo of this unit is shown in
 <A HREF="sv-1r.jpg">Hastings SV-1R TC Gauge Readout</A>.  The heater
 circuit can power the DV-3 at its spec'd current (though at the low
 end of its adjustment range).  However, there is a resistor of about
 15 ohms in series with the DC output of the TC gauge tube
 (pin 7) which results in the 10 mV meter movement actually requiring
 approximately 14 mV for full scale deflection.  So, either it uses a
 different TC gauge tube (perhaps the very obsolete DV-1 or something
 even more ancient).  Or, the DV-3 has to be run at higher than normal
 heater current (which I won't risk until I have confirmation).  Or, the
 circuit has been modified for some unfathomable reason.  A photo of the
 meter scale of another old vacuum gauge matches that of the SV-1R and it
 has "DV-3M" scribbled on the panel which would appear to confirm that
 the SV-1R is indeed designed to use the DV-3.  If anyone has more info,
 please contact me via the
 <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
 Email Links Page</A>.  With the resistor bypassed, this readout appears to
 work correctly with the DV-3M.
<p>
<li><b>A battery powered control unit for the Hastings DV-4D TC gauge
 tube.</b>  The manufacturer of this system uses a Hastings meter but has
 apparently removed the 115 VAC input circuitry and powered the low voltage
 electronics directly which includes a zener regulator and a 500 Hz oscillator
 (two transistors, toroidal transformer) to drive the tube from a 9 V battery
 (pushbutton activated so as not to run the battery down too quickly!) - I
 added an input for an AC adapter since portability isn't a major concern for
 home-built lasers and replaced the pushbutton with a good old toggle switch!
 An IC regulator (LT1084) provides stable 9 VDC from an 11 to 15 VDC source.
 But just in case I need a mobile rig, the battery is still in place - a relay
 automatically switches to the adapter if AC power is present.  (The simpler
 approach of using a pair of blocking diodes would have dropped the battery
 voltage by 0.7 V which would greatly reduce its useful life; using the
 switched contact on the adapter jack would not permit selecting between
 the <i>regulated</i> 9 VDC and battery.  However, the internal zener
 circuit isn't that stiff so operating from the regulated AC adapter is
 more stable.  I have tested this unit with a DV-4AM TC vacuum gauge tube
 and after tweaking the heater current, it works fine.
<p>
<li><b>Hastings VT-4B control unit for the DV-4D TC gauge tube.</b>
 This one required replacement of the line cord and adjustment of the
 position of the mirror behind the meter scale since the exposed section
 was slightly corroded.  I added an IC regulator to replace the simple
 zener circuit originally used (though it worked without this improvement).
 It is now happy with a DV-4AM tube.
<p>
<li><b>Hastings VT-45 control unit for the DV-4D TC gauge tube.</b>  Similar
 to above but in better shape and has selection for 5 TC gauge tubes.
<p>
<li><b>A pair of Hastings control units for the DV-5M TC gauge tube.</b>
 These were well worn, apparently seeing duty in Varian accelerators.  The
 exact model numbers weren't legible.  Like the SV-1R, above, they use a small
 Sola constant voltage (ferro-resonant) transformer for regulation.  Both
 required new line cords.  One now works well after replacing the smashed
 glass on its meter.  After calibration using my DB-18 which is the reference
 tube for the DV-5, it now tracks my NV-8B (DV-8) readout fairly closely which
 gives me some confidence that both the readouts are accurate and the reference
 tube hasn't leaked too much.  While they could all could be screwed up,
 all being screwd up in the same way is unlikely. :)
<p>
 The other unit also works though its meter is somewhat broken and sticky
 so constant tapping is needed while taking readings but it's still useful
 for testing since it would be no great loss if the meter blew up. :)  But
 I'll probably replace the meter, preferably with a VT-6 style for a DV-6M
 if I can find one.  The only required change to be compatible might be a
 resistor to adjust the heater current but even that may not be needed as
 the output may very well end up being within the adjustment range for the
 higher resistance of the DV-6M tube.
<p>
<li><b>Hastings VT-5B control unit for the DV-5M TC gauge tube.</b>  This one
 had been modified to select between two (2) TC gauges tubes.  Although
 everything worked correctly, I replaced the line cord and tube cords because
 they looked kind of ratty. :)
<p>
<li><b>Hastings VT-6B control unit for the DV-6M TC gauge tube.</b>  It looks
 like something exploded and splattered the meter glass with hot globs of
 metal which took a few chunks out of it so that will need replacing and
 it has a very slightly meter but I expect it to be repairable.
<p>
<li><b>Several Hastings CVT-16 vacuum controllers for the DV-6M TC gauge
 tube.</b> These have a single set-point.  They appear to be in pristine
 condition and function correctly.  Two of the CVT-16s are mounted in
 custom metal boxes as stand-alone units.  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvavppr">Vacuum Pump Protector Based on Hastings
 CVT-16</A>.  I have another CVT-16 which I am in the process of restoring
 starting with repair of the meter movement.  Of course, I messed it up
 in the first place so if you must know, see the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvartbs">Repairing the Taut Band Suspension of the
 Meter in a Hastings CVT-16</A>.
<p>
<li><b>Hastings CVT-26 vacuum controller for the DV-6M TC gauge tube.</b>
 This is the dual setpoint version of the CVT-16 and appears to use the
 same technology.
<p>
<li><b>Hastings NV-8B control unit for the DV-8 TC gauge tube.</b>
 This one (genuine Hastings throughout) uses an oscillator to drive
 the tube heater with a regulated AC voltage.  The input to the meter is
 amplified and offset to expand the range between 0.1 and 10 mTorr but this
 sacrifices <i>any</i> reading above 10 mTorr (the useful sensitivity range
 of the DV-8 tube appears to reach at least 100 mTorr even though this is
 not shown in the Hastings specifications for the tube).  A range select
 switch would be a nice addition. :)  I purchased a DV-8M TC gauge
 tube from <A HREF="http://www.oetech.com/">OE Technologies</A> for about half
 the price new from Duniway (see the
 <A HREF="http://www.oetech.com/vac20_24.html">OE Tech High Vacuum Components
 and Equipment Page</A>.  It appears to be brand new though I don't know
 for sure.
<p>
<li><b>Lesker TCC-220 TC controller.</b>  I ripped out the original TC gauge
 circuitry since it was for a tube of unknown type and added an SG-TC2 driver
 for use with the Hastings DV-6M tube.  The scale is fairly close though not
 identical at higher pressure.  Since I now have more than enough DV-6
 compatible readouts and controllers, I will happily restore the TCC-220 to
 use the original sensor.  If anyone knows what this is, please contact me
 via the <A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair
 FAQ Email Links Page</A>.
</ul>
<p>
I suppose I probably have the largest collection of TC gauges outside
Fermilab but I couldn't resist the bargains. :)  The combination of the
those for the DV-4, my home-built using the DV-3 or DV-6, and DV-8;
or the DV-4 and DV-5 provide nice coverage of the pressure range from 20 Torr
to 0.1 milliTorr.
<p>
I'll be selling some of the DV-34s as well as other TC gauge tubes, readouts,
and controllers.  What's available now can be found at

<h4><A NAME="cvaunivd">Universal TC Vacuum Gauge Tube Driver</A></h4>

The following is a description and schematic for a regulated inverter type
driver which can be adapted to just about any TC vacuum gauge by winding
a (simple) transformer and using the proper meter.
<p>
<A HREF="tcdrive1.pdf">Universal TC Vacuum Gauge Tube Driver</A> includes
suggested transformers for the Varian 531, Hastings DV-23, and Hastings DV-6.
The changes required for other TC gauge tubes should be self evident. :)
The design is based on one from Sam Schwartz (Emale98@aol.com) who
also provided portions of the detailed description below.  I have
simplified his a bit further by using an IC regulator in place of a
TL431 and transistor circuit but that's a trivial change.  I was too
lazy to draw the complete circuit. :)  The Varian 531 tube shown has
about the highest heater current of any common TC gauge tube so it
should be no problem to adapt this to lower current tubes.
<p>
The circuit consists of a simple IC regulator
whose voltage is adjustable and supplies 2.5 to 3.5 VDC to the inverter
at about 50 mA for the 531 tube (which requires an exceptionally high heater
current of 165 mA).  Notice that the secondary winding on the transformer
is only one (1) turn, which should be on top of the primary winding and
spread out across that winding.  Nothing is critical about wire size and
the values shown are nominal. The transformer consists of a small pair of
ferrite "E" cores having a center leg diameter of approximately 0.190 inch.
But almost any small ferrite core from your junk box will probably be fine.  All of
the transformer grade ferrite cores saturate at about 2,500 to 3,000 gauss,
so the frequency of operation will depend on the particular ferrite material and
core size that is used but it is not critical.  The 531 version of the circuit runs at about 11 KHz.  The versions for the Hastings tubes will run at a lower
frequency due to the higher number of primary turns.  For the Hastings versions,
I would also suggest increasing the number of turns (maintaining the same
ratios) further (e.g., 2X or 4X) to reduce the likely imbalance between
the halves of centertapped windings due to unavoidable construction
differences.  This will minimize the AC component in the output signal.
Alternatively, monitor the output signal from the gauge tube and hand adjust
the secondary winding position for minimum ripple, then apply hot-melt glue
or other adhesive to keep it from moving.
<p>
The circuit will operate from most any
5 to 12 VDC source such as a small wall adapter.  At the low current, even
a heatsink is optional but won't hurt and would permit input voltages up to
the limit of the LT1084 regulator (35 VDC) but don't forget to use an
appropriately rated capacitor for C1!  An LM317 or other older adjustable
IC regulator could be used instead of the LT1084 but might require a minimum
input voltage slightly above 5 VDC due to its higher dropout voltage.
<p>
If for some reason you wish to lower the frequency of the saturating
core oscillator (for long runs and/or to reduce RFI), turns may be added
to both the primary and secondary coils, but keep the ratio of the
windings the same. If you follow Lenz's law, the number of turns for a
required frequency can be calculated:
<p>
<PRE>
         e = N x d(phi)/dt x 10<sup>-8</sup>

   From which:

         N = [e/{d(phi)/dt}] x 10<sup>8</sup>

         d(phi) = 2 x d(B sat x Area of core)

           (This is the total flux excursion  from -B sat to +B sat that
            occurs in each half cycle. A good approximation for B sat in
            most power ferrites is 3,000 Gauss.)

         dt =  the time of each half cycle = 1/2f
 
         e is very close to the DC supply voltage assuming low transistor 
            saturation voltage;

   Therefore: N = [(Edc x  1/2f)/2(B sat x A core)] x 10<sup>8</sup>

              N = E x 10<sup>8</sup>/(4 B sat x A core x f)
                          
         Use: E in V; B in Gauss; A in square cm; f in Hz.

<h4><A NAME="cvarh4b">Repairing a Hastings VT-4B Vacuum Gauge</A></h4>

The following applies generally to older thermocouple and other similar
devices like Pirani gauges.  As long as the heart of the unit - the actual
meter movement and scale - is in decent condition, everything else can be
easily and inexpensively repaired or replaced.  Though only you can decide
if the time and effort will be worth it, the circuitry is usually so simple
and nearly everything is very non-critical, so troubleshooting usually ends up
being a rewarding experience.  Common problems with older electronics in
general are dried up electrolytic capacitors, bad connections, deteriorated
wiring, and corrosion if used or stored under damp conditions.  The main
precautions to take are to avoid blowing out the meter or TC gauge tube
heater with excessive current - even measuring their resistance with an
analog VOM on the low ohms range may be fatal.
<p>
I picked up this unit for $16 including shipping (just the readout unit,
no tube).  I'm not sure why almost no one else was interested in it.  Although
old (early 1980s probably), only the case style is really different in newer
models.  The VT-4B runs on 115 VAC.  It uses a DV-4D TC gauge tube and has a
useful range of 0.1 to 20 Torr so it is for the upper end of medium vacuums.
The schematic of the VT-4 (courtesy of Hastings) is shown in:
<A HREF="vt46sch.gif">Hastings VT-4/VT-6 Readout Circuit</A>.  (The VT-4B
simply has the VT-4 readout installed in a metal case with power switch
and power indicator.)
<p>
This is actually my second TC gauge using a DV-4D tube.  When I worked on
repairing this unit, I didn't yet have a TC gauge tube for either but was able
to look at the heater drive signal with an oscilloscope and inject a low DC
voltage to simulate the thermocouple output to test the meter and amplifiers,
if any (in this unit there are no amplifiers for the meter).  What I saw on
the scope was significant 60 Hz modulation of the 4 kHz signal.  (It seems
that no two TC gauges ever use the same drive frequency!)  Figuring that this
was due to dried up electrolytic capacitors, I opened the back of the
meter (all the circuitry is on a printed circuit board inside a metal
cover).  There were a grand total of two (2) caps (one for half wave
rectified line voltage and the other for the low voltage derived from
it - 4 uF at 150 WVDC and 20 uF at 10 WVDC).  Both tested bad on my ESR
meter.  Replacing them with slightly larger values from my used but
tested stock, totally cleaned up the drive signal which was a bit over 0.3 V
p-p, just about right for the DV-4D TC gauge tube (there is an adjustment
of this if needed).
<p>
Next I connected a 9 V battery through a 1000:1 voltage divider to test the
meter.  This worked fine but I noticed that the mirror behind the scale on
the meter face had the measles. :(  Corrosion apparently.  Being a
perfectionist in these matters, I disassembled the faceplate of the meter
and removed the scale.  The mirror is actually just a thin piece of
chrome-plated sheet metal taped to the back of the scale.  Shifting its
position down slightly exposed a much nicer surface.  (Note that
any work inside the meter case should only be done in a clean location and
tools should be non-magnetic to prevent ferrous particles from being sucked
into the meter's magnet as these are very difficult to remove.)  I also
replaced the line cord which had seen better days. :)
<p>
Now all I need is a DV-4D TC gauge tube!  Actually, I do have what appears
to be a DV-4AM (no label but the base is Hastings blue and it shows roughly
the correct resistance between pins 3 and 5 with another connection on pin 7)
which came (incorrectly) attached to a Kurt J. Lesker TCC-220 vacuum gauge
controller so I will try that.  Though the DV-4AM and DV-4D have slightly
different heater requirements, they should be generally interchangeable
requiring only a slight increase in heater current.  Indeed, the DV-4AM
seems to work fine after a small adjustment.  I still would like to find
a DV-4D for this or my other gauge (which I also tested with the DV-4AM).
<p>
Later, after noticing that the line regulation of the simple zener circuit
wasn't that great, and in addition, the reading was drifting as the gauge
heated up, I replaced the AC input circuitry with a low voltage power supply
consisting of a 12.6 VRMS centertapped transformer, full wave rectifier,
filter capacitor, and LT1084 regulator set up for 6.0 VDC, which was slightly
less than what I measured across the zener but the adjustment pot had plenty
of extra range and that allowed me to use a transformer I had gathering dust
on my transformer shelf.  I also added a 1 A fuse for the AC as there
was none originally.  There was plenty of space in the box for everything.
Performing a similar upgrade on any Hastings TC gauge where only a zener
is used (usually where all the circuitry is inside a metal can on the back
of the meter) would probably be beneficial.

<h4><A NAME="cvartbs">Repairing the Taut Band Suspension of the Meter in a
 Hastings CVT-16</A></h4>

The following applies directly to the meter movements in Hastings CVT
controllers using newer style meters with the blue and black logo, as
well as similar newer style VT meters (except for the stupid design
part since there is no know, see below).  However, the very newest
(current) versions may have fixed this but I haven't seen one so I
don't know for sure. :)
<p>
I was forced to attempt this repair after accidentally damaging the suspension
in a Hastings CVT-16 thermocouple vacuum gauge controller.  OK, I really didn't
have to do it as replacements for the entire unit could be found relatively
inexpensively on eBay but I considered it a challenge.  Also, if I bought a
replacement for the entire unit, I'd then have yet another set of electronics
without a meter!  (The meters used in these instruments are special low
impedance devices so stock replacements would not work.)
<p>
The broken meter looks like the meter portion of <A HREF="tcvgpp1.jpg">TC
Vacuum Gauge and Pump Protector</A>.  The adjustment knob is used to move the
red set-point pointer (which is mechanically and electrically independent of
the meter).
<p>
The problem occurred when I obtained a unit (not the one in the photo) that
had a broken adjustment knob.  In attempting to confirm that the set-point
adjustment worked, I foolishly tried using a tool to turn what remained of the
shaft behind the knob.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice that the suspension for
the front taut band is located behind the knob and unprotected.  So, it
basically got shredded.  Can you spell "stupid design"?. :( If the knob's
shaft was solid instead of hollow, there would have been no problem.
<p>
I normally consider damage to meter movement bearings to be non-repairable but
as I said, this was a challenge. :)  The first step was to confirm that enough
of the band remained to attach to a new suspension.  After removing the front
cover and set-point mechanism, the extent of the damage could be seen.  The
suspension was just a formed piece of metal - something springy and the band
was still soldered to its twisted remains.  A quick touch of a hot soldering
iron and the band was free.  While it was completely intact, there wasn't much
of it - perhaps 1/16 inch sticking up though the "cup" where the suspension was
located.  And, the band is extremely thin - perhaps 1 mil x 5 mils (1 mil =
0.001 inch).
<p>
To replace the suspension, I cut a piece of thin copper sheet into a shape
that when folded over would fit in the cup.  Thus, there was a top and bottom.
An off-center hole was drilled and tapped for an 0-80 screw that would adjust
the separation of the two "leaves".  A 0.01" hole was drilled in the center of
the top for the band to fit through with a larger clearance hole in the
bottom.  This contraption was filed so it would fit loosely in the cup.
<p>
My original plan was to mount an XYZ micropositioner above the meter with a
gripper to hold the band to enable adjustment before soldering it to the new
suspension.  I even fabricated a wonderful little screw clamp to use as a
gripper.  However, the band tip is so darn short and thin that this proved
to be unworkable.  So, the folded suspension almost flat was placed in the cup
with the band tip poking through its hole.  This affair was held down with a
piece of wire fastened to a convenient screw (to prevent the surface tension
of hot solder from lifting it), and the band was soldered to the
suspension.  Next, the 0-80 screw was installed and tightened until the meter
frame/coil came free, and then some to provide clearance.  The suspension was
then adjusted in position to center the frame/coil and in angle to set the
zero on the scale with the zero lever centered.
<p>
This replacement is no doubt not as robust as the original since it's not very
resilient.  Any good whack in the direction toward the back of the meter would
probably cause the band to fail due to the inertia of the frame/coil but it does
seem to work.  Also, since the length of the free part of the band and its
tension have changed, it is likely that the calibration will be slightly
different.

<h4><A NAME="cvavppr">Vacuum Pump Protector Based on Hastings CVT-16</A></h4>

Here is the schematic for a simple unit what incorporates the Hastings
CVT-16 thermocouple vacuum controller to power a diffusion, turbo, other
high vacuum pump, an ion or other high vacuum gauge, or the mechanical
pump itself.  It automatically shuts down equipment providing protection
against loss of vacuum and other faults.  Normally these functions would be
provided in an ion (or other high vacuum) gauge controller but this could
be used as an additional level of protection.  The circuit of the
<A HREF="vpprot1.gif">Vacuum Pump Protector 1</A> is based on a unit
I acquired on eBay, supposedly from NASA surplus.  For a grand total
of $17.90 including shipping, it was in surprisingly good condition, the
most major flaw being a cracked glass faceplate on the CVT-16 meter.  This
was easily replaced with a piece of 1/16" picture frame glass approximately
4-5/16" x 2-15/32".  (These dimensions apply to all the modern
Hastings VT and CVT meters.)  There was also a cold solder
joint on the power input (resoldered) and the TC select switch was erratic
(fixed with contact cleaner).  The <A HREF="tcvgpp1.jpg">TC Vacuum Gauge and
Pump Protector</A> (note spelling!) appears to be custom built as there is
no evidence of a manufacturer on the unit itself.
<p>
Aside from mounting the CVT-16 in a nice box (a non-trivial benefit!), a
power relay enables loads up to 12 A to be controlled.  (The power relay
actually has mercury wetted contacts rated for 35 A.  Wire size and the
plug and socket type used in the protector's construction limit current to
12 A.)  Basic operation simply uses the set-point of the
CVT-16 to control the relay so load power is only present when the vacuum
is below a specified pressure.  However, there is also a fault input which
allows the load to be turned off remotely by a contact closure, for example,
a thermal overload device.  When this event happens, the load remains off
even if the contacts open.  Pressing "Reset" will restore normal operation
if the fault condition has been removed.  Pressing "Reset" and "Load Hold"
at the same time will override the fault and allow the load to be powered
should this be needed to remove the fault condition.  Pressing "Load Hold"
under normal conditions will override the CVT-16 set-point and allow the
load to be powered regardless of pressure.
<p>
I have another somewhat similar unit that includes a small power relay but
lacks the interlock functions.  These are apparently becoming available as
surplus from various U.S. Government sources like NASA and Oakridge.

<h4><A NAME="cvaa220">Adapting a Lesker TCC-220 to Use a Hastings DV-6M TC
 Gauge Tube</A></h4>

I acquired this analog controller supposedly with matching sensor for under
$25.  See: <A HREF="tcc220-1.jpg">Kurt J. Lesker Model TCC-220 TC Vacuum
Controller</A>. It has a range of 0 to 1,000 microns with fully adjustable
upper and lower limits.  Voltage comparators drive relays for controlling 
external equipment with red and green LEDs indicating the state of the relays.
The set-points are adjusted by push-to-turn pots with red and green pointers
positioned by separate knobs to correspond to the comparator settings.
Although the pointers don't automatically track the set-points, they can be
checked at any time independent of the actual gauge reading.  I prefer this
system to the mechanical tracking of Hastings CVT controllers.
<p>
All the electronics worked fine but I did have to remove the front cover and
clean out a sticky meter movement.  The sensor (visible in the photo) turned
out to be a Hastings DV-4AM which has a very different calibration curve than
what was on the meter face.  That appeared to match up quite closely with the
meter face for the Hastings VT-6 using the DV-6 TC gauge tube (though I later
discovered that it diverged somewhat at pressures above about 100 mT).  In
addition, the controller was actually wired for a TC gauge tube with a DC
heater on pins 1 and 7 with a 10 mV full scale output (at high vacuum) between
pins 3 and 5 - nothing like the DV-4AM or any other Hastings TC gauge tube
which use an AC heater. Thus the DV-4AM could never have worked with this
controller.  Since I haven't been collecting TC gauge tubes with separate
heater and output pins, at first I was disappointed that I didn't have any
way of using this controller.  But then I noticed that the wiring looked
like it wasn't original anyhow but had been cobbled together to operate
the non-Hastings tube - the PCB looks like it was actually designed for
a Hastings-type tube with an AC heater but none of the parts were ever
installed.  What circuitry there was was basically a mess, simply soldered
any which way to pads that were conveniently located.
<p>
So I disconnected the kludgeware and replaced it with a copy of
the heater driver used in SG-TC2.  Almost everything else (power supplies
and meter amplifier for 10 mV full scale input) is already present.  The only
other modification was the addition of a 50 ohm resistor across the meter
input since that's about what a Hastings meter would have.  The original 1K
ohm input resistance resulted in readings that were way high.  A quick tweak
to the zero adjust to match up with the atm mark on the meter face and presto!
It now works nicely as a DV-6M based vacuum controller at the most important
high vacuum-end of the scale but with slight correction required at pressures
above about 100 mT.  Oh, well, one can't have everything. :)

Everything is built on a piece of perf board with a 9 V battery tied
underneath.  See: <A HREF="thvttst1.jpg">Hastings VT and CVT Meter Tester</A>.
<p>
R1 and R2 are current limiting resistors - two are used to prevent the
possibility of a single failure frying the meter. :)  In conjunction with
R3 and the typical internal resistance of the gauge, this implements an
approximately 750:1 voltage divider for the output of R4.  The input to the
meter on "High" can then vary from about 0 to 15 mV with a fresh 9 V battery
and still reach 10 mV with an old tired one.  On "Low", the maximum voltage is
about 1/3 of these for use with higher sensitivity meters.  Rc and Rd should
be selected based on the internal resistance of the TC sensor (e.g., 11/2 ohms
each for the DV-4D) to provide the proper load for the heater drive signal,
which can then be monitored across TP2 and TP3.  Measure meter voltage between
TP1 and TP4.  The second toggle switch is included for future expansion. :)
Note: For gauges and controllers without active circuitry in the meter
circuit, testing of the meter can be done with the unit unpowered.
<p>
Adding an octal female connector for the TC gauge tube and a DPDT switch to
select it would be useful for gauge calibration.  A removable jumper in the
heater circuit would permit current measurements to be made but note that
the typical multimeter may have enough voltage drop on their current ranges
to significantly reduce the heater current in this low voltage circuit
resulting in an incorrect setting (5 or 10 percent too high).

<h4><A NAME="cvahtst">Sam's Hastings TC Gauge Tester 1</A></h4>

The circuit below can be used to test any Hastings TC readout or controller
(VT or CVT) using the DV-3, DV-4, DV-5, DV-6, or DV-8 TC gauge tubes for
correct operation without the use of a vacuum system or even the need for the
matching tube.  It is essentially a universal reference tube emulator.
While not quite as accurate as using individual reference tubes (an expensive
one for each type gauge), the parts cost of the tester is negligible and any
major problems will be obvious in about 5 seconds.  Once calibrated for a
specific readout or controller unit (or units), the readings should be
consistent and enable a quick test should behavior of that unit change
for unknown reasons.

<p>
A small stepup transformer is used to boost the AC heater voltage to a value
that can be rectified with regular diodes.  For best performance, the
transformer should probably use a ferrite core but a regular iron power
transformer will work for systems using an AC line powered TC gauge heater,
and probably for most oscillator powered systems as well.  I used a Stancor
115 V to 12.6 VCT power transformer in reverse for initial tests.  Later I
wound a transformer on a ferrite core with 100 turns for the primary
(centertapped) and 1,000 turns for the secondary.  The filtered output is then
used to drive the meter through a voltage divider.  A 5.1 V zener diode limits
output voltage to protect the meter should the input somehow be connected to
a higher than normal voltage source.  The TC gauge type is switch selectable
both for calibration and to provide an appropriate load on the heater drive
circuit.  An "OFF" position disconnects the load and meter but leaves the
filtered (peak) output available for measurement.  The calibration pots can
be used to equalize sensitivity for each type of TC gauge so they all will
result in the same reading at any setting of the Adj pot.  Since all 6
positions are wired similarly, they can really be used any way desired.
For example, they can be precisely matched to several specific TC gauges
of the same type rather than different types as shown in the schematic.
For the "OFF" position, resistors can be added externally between TP1 and
TP2 for the heater load and between TP4 and TP3 for meter current
limiting.  Of course if only a single type of TC gauge is to be tested
and/or if instant selection isn't required, the circuit can be greatly
simplified.  The extension to testing of the DV-23 and DV-24 based Hasting
TC gauges is left as an exercise for the reader. :)
<p>
Note that since this circuit does not generate an output proportional to the
true RMS value of the heater current, there will be slight differences in
response based on the actual waveform used to drive the heater.  This depends
on the specific implementation of the readout or controller.  An op-amp based
true RMS converter could be added if the objective is to faithfully replicate
the behavior of a TC gauge reference tube.
<p>
I built the tester into a 2" x 2" x 4" aluminum minibox (recycled from
another project of course!) with the selector switch and output adjust
pot on the front and an octal plug and test points on the back.  It's very
handy. :)

<h4><A NAME="cvacvgs">Cleaning Vacuum Gauge Sensors</A></h4>

Should pump oil back up into the vacuum system and enter the sensor(s),
cleaning is essential to prevent damage to the sensor elements when the
gauge is operated.  At the very least, calibration will be compromised.
And, after awhile, just normal oil backstreaming from the pump if there
is no trap may coat the sensor elements and cleaning will be necessary
to restore accurate calibration (but this would probably not happen suddenly).
Such treatment may also benefit any used sensors acquired in unknown condition.
<p>
Hydrocarbon-based pump oil (the kind most commonly used in rotary vane
vacuum pumps) dissolves easily in a variety of solvents including
carburetor/choke cleaner and electronics cleaner/degreaser.  For other
types, confirm that they won't leave a residue and test on a drop of pump
oil to see that the solvent and oil mix almost instantly.  Don't use WD40
or similar products for anything remotely involved in a high vacuum system! :)
Pump oil may not readily dissolve in other common solvents like tape head
cleaner.  Carburetor/choke cleaner is very aggressive at dissolving gum and
varnish (possible byproducts of decomposed pump oil) but make sure to protect
the sensor tube label from the solvent as the printing may disappear.  This
and products like WD-40 (which I don't recommend) may also leave an oily
film behind which will itself need to be removed using something else.
I'm sure there are heavy duty industrial solvents for this purpose but those
mentioned above are likely to be available in your basement, or hardware or
electronics store.
<p>
WARNING: Wear protective goggles and work in a well ventilated location away
from open flames.  Most of these solvents are extremely flammable and may not
too good for your internal organs either.
<p>
To clean Hastings and other similar gauge sensors, use an extension tube to
slowly squirt enough solvent directly into the inside of the sensor so there
is enough to slosh around.  Avoid poking the tube inside too far as this might
damage the sensor elements.  Shake the tube to allow the solvent to do its
thing and then empty it completely.  Repeat this process 3 or 4 times until
the exiting solvent evaporates without leaving any noticeable residue.  If
the sensor was operated when contaminated, assuming it is salvageable at all,
several applications of solvent or extended soaking may be needed to remove the
baked-on or burnt-on decomposed pump oil, which will typically make the gauge
read low, up to 20 percent or more with respect to meter voltage.
<p>
CAUTION: Allow any solvent remaining inside the sensor tube to completely
evaporate before reattaching it to your vacuum system.  If significant
solvent mixes with oil in the mechanical pump, the base pressure may rise
to unacceptable levels requiring a flushing and oil change to reestablish
decent performance if extended running to outgas the oil along with opening
gas ballast valve doesn't help.
<p>
Where the contamination is from something other than pump oil, modify the
above appropriately keeping in mind the materials used in the construction
of your sensor tubes and their and elements.

<h3><A NAME="cvagmano">Manometer Vacuum Gauges</A></h3>

Unlike thermocouple vacuum gauges, the calibration of manometers are
essentially independent of gas composition.  The most basic version allows
the difference in liquid levels to be observed visually.  Sophisticated
gauges with capacitive sensing and electronic readouts provide highly
sensitive and repeatable measurements.

<h4><A NAME="cvahbmg">Home-built Closed-End Manometer Gauge</A></h4>

(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
Many vacuum systems use U-tube manometers.  While the U-tube is accurate, it
requires a vacuum cock to allow zeroing and if one accidentally pumps down the
system with the cock closed, it will likely blow the manometer oil into the
vacuum manifold.  The closed-end manometer requires no such manipulation
because its reference is the (near) perfect vacuum in the closed arm.
<p>
One such design is shown in <A HREF="manomtr.gif">Closed-End Manometer
Gauge</A>.
<p>
The fluid movement in each leg is proportional to the ratio of inside
diameters. This manometer and its scale is designed to be built with standard
neon sign lead glass tubing.  If you change tubing, you will have to
recalculate the scale division.  Ditto if you use a different fluid.
<p>
This manometer is designed to be used with Dow DC-704, a diffusion pump fluid
available from <A HREF="http://www.duniway.com/">Duniway Stockroom</A>.  This
fluid has a specific gravity of 0.975.  Octoil and other similar fluids will
also work but may be more hygroscopic and more viscous.  I added a drop of
butyl oil to give it some color.  Any analine dye would also work but it
would outgas a bit.
<p>
My scale is etched on a piece of steel.  A hunk of flexible magnetic plastic
is glued to the mount.  This lets me slide the scale as needed to zero the
manometer.
<p>
To fill the manometer, fill the 15 mm leg about half-full of fluid.  Then
connect it to a vacuum of about 100 micron or better.  Tilt the manometer
so that the small leg is up.  Make sure there is an open path from the small
leg to the vacuum. The better vacuum at this point, the more stable the zero.
Rotate the manometer upright.  Release the vacuum.  The fluid should rise
completely to the top of the closed end.  If it doesn't, apply as high a
vacuum as you have and heat the closed end bulb with a heat gun.  This should
drive out most of the remaining air.
<p>
Theoretically the two legs should balance with a high vacuum applied but it
rarely happens that way.  The manometer fluid will outgas some moisture and
there will be some trapped gas in the closed leg.
<p>
My manometer is attached to my brass plumbing fitting manifold using a
modified compression fitting.  Simply take an appropriately sized compression
fitting (7/8", I think), remove the ferrule and replace it with a couple of
Viton O-rings.  Grease the O-rings with vacuum grease.  Then simply slide the
15 mm leg of the manometer into the fitting and finger tighten.
<p>
To operate, pull as high a vacuum as possible on the system.  Slide the scale
so that the zero line aligns with the fluid level.  Then measure the pressure.

<h4><A NAME="cvacapm">The Capacitance Manometer Vacuum/Pressure Gauge</A></h4>

Like the closed-end manometer, the capacitance manometer is a direct
pressure measuring device.  <A HREF="http://www.mksinst.com/">MKS
Instruments</A> is a major manufacturer of process control devices using
their "Baratron" pressure transducers based on
the capacitance manometer principle.  These have full scale ranges from
20 microns to 1,000 Torr.  There are other manufacturers of capacitance
manometer based vacuum/pressure measuring devices including Teledyne Hastings
but the best known is probably <A HREF="http://www.bocedwards.com/">BOC
Edwards</A> with their "Barocel" models (formerly from Datametrics).
<p>
A nice on-line introduction to the technology is given in
<A HREF="http://www.mksinst.com/product/barainfo2d.aspx">Baratron Capacitance Manometer
Basics</A>.  For a vacuum sensor, a thin metal diaphragm separates a
permanently evacuated and sealed "reference" volume from the vacuum
system whose pressure is being measured.  (Differential pressure transducers
provide access to both sides of the diaphragm.)  The metal diaphragm and a
fixed electrode form a (more or less parallel plate) capacitor which is the
frequency determining element of an oscillator.  The diaphragm is somewhat
flexible acting as a nearly ideal spring over a range of pressures determined
by the mechanical design of the tansducer.  So, as the pressure changes,
the oscillator frequency also changes.  Since for a parallel plate
capacitor, capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between
the plates, and the frequency of an RC circuit is inversely proportional
to capacitance, the frequency of the oscillator ends up be proportional
to the pressure difference between the reference volume and system vacuum.
A frequency-to-voltage converter (basically a triggered pulse generator and
averager) followed by op-amp circuits to adjust gain (span) and zero setting
provides an output voltage (typically) between 0 and 10 VDC where 10 VDC
corresponds to full scale with extremely good linearity with respect to
pressure over the entire range.
<p>
The benefits of this approach are several:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike thermocouple and related indirect vacuum gauges, the capacitance
 manometer is a device which directly measures pressure and thus its
 readings are totally independent of the composition of the gases being
 pumped.  Therefore, it is ideal for gas lasers where the gases are almost
 never just plain old air!
<p>
<li>The response time is almost instantaneous compared to a TC gauge -
 typically 5 ms rather than many seconds or minutes.  If the pump results in
 pressure pulsations, these will even be detectable on a readout with
 sufficiently fast response.
<p>
<li>As noted, the output is just a voltage which is linear with respect to
 pressure over its specified range.  Thus, any inexpensive digital or analog
 panel meter can be used, or just your Radio Shack multimeter!
</ul>
<p>
Modern versions of these capacitance manometer based vacuum/pressure gauges
have few deficiencies but for older models, there were several:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature affects the mechanical structure (and to a lesser extent, the
 sensing electronics) so a heater is usually included to maintain a constant
 temperature.  Thus, there is a warmup period and this can be two hours or more
 before the system stabilizes.  At any given instant, the sensor will respond
 to pressure changes accurately but the zero setting will continue to drift
 during the warmup period.  Edwards claims to have almost totally eliminated
 zero drift with warmup.
<p>
<li>Cycling between a pressure within the specified range and 1 atm or above
 may require re-zeroing of the transducer due to mechanical stress.  This
 is not a problem with newer designs but for the 227A, below, exposing
 the transducer to a pressure up to 1,000 Torr won't cause permanent damage
 but anything above 110 percent of full scale, even for an instant, may
 require re-zeroing.
<p>
<li>Due to the delicate nature of the diaphragm, especially for units with
 a small full scale rating like 1 Torr, mechanical vibrations must be
 minimized by isolating the transducer from the pump(s) since resonance
 conditions can occur.  They can be operated in any position but require
 re-zeroing when changing orientation (e.g., from vertical to horizontal).
 For example, with the 227A, the change in reading is about 5 microns
 between horizontal and vertical orientation.
</ul>
<p>
For continuous manufacturing processes run for days or weeks without
interruption, these deficiencies (the first two in particular) wouldn't
matter.  But for many applications (some of ours included), they may more
than outweigh the fast response, superb accuracy and resolution, and gas
independence of capacitance manometers.  Thus, if you find an older model,
realize that it may have its own set of quirks that will need
to be dealt with to maintain your sanity. :)  A gauge of this type would be
ideal for the HeNe and Ar/Kr ion lasers, and others that are pumped down and
maintained below a certain pressure over long periods of operation or
prior to seal-off of the tube.  A gauge with a 10 Torr full scale rating
would be suitable for these lasers since they operate between a fraction
of a Torr and a few Torr.  For the CO2 and N2 lasers, a gauge with a full
scale rating of 100 Torr could be used.
<p>
I found an MKS Instruments Baratron model 227A rated at 1 Torr full scale in
the trash and decided to see if it worked.  As noted above, one nice thing
about these sensors is that all the "smarts" are inside the pressure
transducer.  Only a +/-15 VDC power supply and a digital or analog meter
with a full scale range of 10 VDC is needed to complete the vacuum gauge.
Not like those silly thermocouple gauges with their weird power supplies
and custom non-linear meter scales. :)
<p>
I contacted MKS Instruments and they were kind enough to fax the operation
manual for this unit but didn't let me forget that it hadn't been manufactured
in at least 15 years and was quite obsolete.  The replacement is the 627B
and they would happily give me a 15% discount with trade-in.  Right, thanks. :)
(Search for "627B" on their Web site.)
While some of the details may have improved, the basic principles of operation
are unchanged and the operation manuals for the newer models are very similar
to that of the 227A in terms of warmup though the sensitivity to overpressure
has apparently been reduced.
<p>
This unit had been partially disassembled so I didn't expect that it would
work perfectly, or possibly at all.  After putting it back together and wiring
up a cable, I found that there was a response to pressure but it was not
possible to zero the output using the externally accessible adjustment even
after a long warmup time.  The reading would only go down as far as about
80 microns when I knew the actual pressure to be under 10 microns.  Without
specifications for the capacitance of the diaphragm and/or frequency
calibration, all I could check out was the electronics and as far as I
could tell, this was operating correctly, including the gain (span) and zero
circuitry, and temperature regulating heater.  Possibly the diaphragm
had been damaged from mechanical shock or sudden pressure changes.  So,
to at least make the gauge usable enough to determine how far off its
calibration might be, I modified the zero circuitry so it would have
enough range.  It will be a simple matter to restore if I find an actual
problem elsewhere.  Now, it can be zeroed at any time but the zero setting
drifts by about 30 microns from a cold start to an hour or so later.
<p>
I made some measurements of a few internal signals including the 10 V and
1.9 V references, the oscillator frequency from the manometer, the output
voltage after the frequency-to-voltage converter, and the zero voltage
reference (the 1.9 V reference multiplied by a bit over 5, adjustable via the
Zero pot).  During warmup, the F-V output increases by about +0.3 while the
zero voltage reference decreases by about 0.1% (the 1.9 V from which it is
derived is rock solid).  These are darn small changes but when their sum is
multiplied by the gain of the output stage (about 15), would appear to account
for the zero drift.  Unfortunately, the basic design of this system results in
the output for zero microns being derived from the difference of two large
numbers so small changes in either have a large effect.  The cause of the
zero offest voltage drift may just be a resistor with a large temperature
coefficient, easily remedied.  But, the cause of the much more significant
F-V output drift is unknown.  It may in fact be the capacitance of the
manometer changing slightly with warmup or due to an electronics problem.
Or, this amount of drift from cold to warm may be perfectly normal since
the magnitude of the expected drift is not listed in the MKS manual for the
227A or any other Baratron transducer.
<p>
I have checked the 227A's calibration against my Hastings VT-4B thermocouple
vacuum gauge and once zeroed, the readings do track within 20 percent over
its entire range of 0 to 1 Torr.  I consider it more likely that the
calibration of the TC gauge is faulty than that of the Baratron.
The long (but normal) warmup time is the most significant annoyance with the
227A.  Cycling between 1 atm and high vacuum doesn't result in much of a
change in the zero setting - perhaps 1 or 2 microns at most.  And, a foam
cushion takes care of any vibration effects.
<p>
To take advantage of the fast response of the capacitance manometer gauge, an
analog meter is really much better than a digital display.  So, I haven't
decided whether to use the 4-1/2 digit panel meter (with BCD output) I also
found in the trash as the readout for this gauge. :)

<h3><A NAME="cvagion">Ionization Vacuum Gauges</A></h3>

WARNING: Unlike thermocouple gauges with their mostly low voltages, ionization
gauges may have 150 V to 800 V or more with enough current available to be
lethal inside the unit as well as on the various electrodes of the ion gauge
tube sensor.  All connections should be properly insulated.  Do NOT attempt
to change connections while powered and after powering off, confirm that
voltages have decayed to near zero before touching anything!
<p>
There are many types available.  The most common and somewhat standardized
variety are of the "Bayard-Alpert" design using a hot filament (as in a
vacuum tube).  However, cold cathode ion gauges are also available.  These
should be more robust as the hot filament is easily damaged should the
pressure rise unexpectedly.
<p>
The operation of a Bayard-Alpert gauge is based on the ionization of
residual gas molecules by a constant flow of electrons.  Please see
<A HREF="iongbd1.gif">Functional Block Diagram of Ionization Vacuum
Gauge</A> when reading the description below.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The ion gauge tube (sensor) consists of a filament (either tunsgtan or
 coated) outside of a helical grid.  A straight wire collector for the ions
 is in the center.  Some ion gauge tubes have two or more filaments so that
 if one burns out, another can be used in its place.
<p>
<li>The grid is maintained at a positive voltage (typically +180 VDC),
 with the filament at a lower but still positive voltage (typically +30 VDC).
 With this constant potential difference, emission current (called
 I<sup>-</sup>) is related to filament temperature.  A feedback loop
 maintains emission current at a constant value (typically 0.6 to 2.4 mA).
<p>
<li>Electrons attracted to the grid collide with and ionize some
 percentage of the residual gas molecules in their path.  These, being
 positively charged, will be attracted to the collector electrode which
 is maintained at ground potential (0 V).
<p>
<li>The resulting ion current (called I<sup>+</sup>) is directly
 proportional to pressure in the range of 10<sup>-4</sup> to
 10<sup>-8</sup> and somewhat beyond.  This current goes into a high
 sensitivity amplifier called an "electrometer" which drives an
 analog meter or digital display.
<p>
<li>Auto or manual ranging circuits may be used to provide expanded
 scales for each decade of pressure.  A compressed "log" scale may be
 selected on some models which compresses the entire range into a
 single meter display.
<p>
<li>Interlock circuits protect the ion gauge tube from increases in
 pressure beyond the safe limits, and for other fault conditions.
 Inputs from other (e.g., TC vacuum gauges) may also be used for this.
<p>
<li>The ion gauge controller typically provides one or more "process
 control" outputs to switch other equipment based on the measured
 pressure (not shown).
</ul>
<p>
More detailed technical information can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.lesker.com/cfdocs/newweb/Pressure_Measurement/Hot_Filament/TechInfo.cfm">Kurt J. Lesker's Hot Filament Ion Gauges Notes</A>.
<p>
The circuitry of an ion gauge or controller is really quite simple.
The only part which is non-trivial is the electrometer amplifier
which must deal with extremely small values of ion current.  It is
quite possible to build a unit of this type using readily available
parts (except for the ion gauge tube, of course).  Unlike the
thermocouple gauge, the response is linear so a funny meter scale
(analog meter) or lookup table (digital readout) isn't even required.
However, ion gauge controllers are readily available surplus for
a small fraction of their new cost.  And, though straightforward,
a home-built ion gauge would be still be a fairly involved project.
<p>
The required ion gauge controller subsystems include:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Filament power supply:</b> Filament current is precisely regulated
 based on desired electron emission current.
<p>
 Typical requirements: 3 to 5 VAC at 4 to 6 A.
<p>
<li><b>Filament bias supply:</b> Regulated voltage of around +30 VDC.
 Since this only has to source current, it may just be a zener circuit
 and will only show a voltage when there is an actual current flow.
<p>
 Typical requirements: +30 VDC being able to source the emission current.
<p>
<li><b>Grid bias supply:</b> Regulated voltage to attract electrons from the
 filament.
<p>
 Typical requirements: +180 VDC at up to the maximum emission current of
 0.5 to 2.5 mA, some up to 10 mA or more.
<p>
<li><b>Degas power supply:</b> Some means is provided to heat the grid and
 collector to drive off gases that may have contaminated their surfaces when
 the system was at high pressure or up to air.  Two techniques may be used:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Resistance heating (most common):</b> This provides current to
  heat the grid electrode directly and the collector by radiant heat.  It
  may take power from the same source as the filament or a separate supply.
  With the latter, the pressure can be monitored while degassing which may
  be desirable.  With a single supply, this is obviously not possible.
  This approach may also be called "joule heating".
<p>
  Typical requirements: 8 V at 10 A.
<p>
 <li><b>Electron bombardment (less common):</b> An alternative technique
  applies a higher voltage difference than used when measuring pressure (up
  to 800 V peak compared to around 150 VDC) between the filament and grid
  (which is shorted to the collector), resulting in a current
  flow of up to 150 mA or more.  This results in heating of both the grid
  and collector.  Pressure cannot be measured while this
  type of degas is in progress.  Electron bombardment degas should not be
  operated above about 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr as the effect will be of a
  glow discharge rather than direct electron flow reducing effectiveness
  and possibly damaging the grid and collector by oxidation.
<p>
  Typical requirements: 600 VRMS at 25 to 150 mA.
 </ul>
<p>
 As noted, most ionization gauge controllers use resistance or joule heating
 for degas.  The only ones I've seen with electron bombardment degas are a
 couple of old Veeco models - the RG-840 (and RG-84 which is basically the
 same).  Veeco also produced controllers using joule heating degas - the RG-830
 (and RG-83).  Aside from the degas technique, these are all identical.  I
 don't know if there is any benefit to electron bombardment degas but it is
 certainly more complex and much more dangerous (with 800 V at sizable
 current availability) present on the ion gauge tube electrodes as well
 as the electrometer input during degas.
<p>
<li><b>Electrometer amplifier:</b> This is a high sensitivity amplifier
 range selectable between 10<sup>-3</sup> and 10<sup>-7</sup>
 Torr full scale (give or take a an decade or two).  Fancier controllers
 will include autoranging capability (or of course, fully digital readout!)
<p>
 Typical requirements: The sensitivity depends on the particular Bayard-Alpert
 ion gauge tube sensitivity, S, expressed as Ip/Ie/Torr where Ie is the
 electron emission current, Ip is the positive ion collector current, and
 the units are reciprocal pressure (this is explained in more detail at the
 Lesker Web site, above).  But basically, it means that at a pressure of
 1 Torr, the ion current would be S times the electron current.  Of course,
 these ion gauge tubes can't be run at 1 Torr but the ion current scales
 linearly with pressure.  So, for example, an ion gauge tube with with
 S=10/Torr and an emission current of 1 mA would produce an ion current
 of 1 uA at a pressure of 1x10<sup>-4</sup> Torr.  Thus, for a full scale
 reading of 10<sup>-7</sup> Torr, the amplifier must have a full scale
 sensitivity of 1 nA!
<p>
<li><b>Process control outputs:</b> Circuitry to allow (usually 2) set-points
 to be specified to operate other equipment.
<p>
<li><b>Interlock circuits:</b> These provide protection for the ion gauge
 filament from high pressure and the electronics from external short circuits
 or other faults.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="cvacigc">Checking Out an Ionization Gauge Controller</A></h4>

Here is a general procedure for checking out an ion gauge controller without
an ion gauge sensor or vacuum system, or the gadget described in the next
section.
<p>
For the purposes of this description, we assume that the controller is
compatible with the typical Bayard-Alpert ion gauge sensor such as the
Lesker G075TN which has the following specs:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Filament voltage: 3 to 5 VAC.
<li>Filament current: 4 to 6 AAC.
<li>Grid voltage: +150 VDC with respect to grid.
<li>Grid degas: 6.3 to 7.5 V at approximately 10 A.
<li>Collector voltage: -20 to -50 VDC with respect to grid.
<li>Emission current 1 mA or 10 mA.
</ul>
<p>
(See: <A HREF="http://www.lesker.com/cfdocs/newweb/Pressure_Measurement/Hot_Filament/GaugeTubes_CrossReference_BA.cfm">Bayard-Alpert Cross Reference</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/PDFs/ApplicationNotes/IG1manrefapp.pdf">Manufacturer Cross-Reference for Bayard-Alpert Gauges</A> for
other equivalents.)
<p>
The actual voltages found on the various pins as well as emission current
range will depend on the design of the controller.
<p>
We will use an auto head light bulb to provide a load in place of the
ion gauge tube filament and for the grid degas (not at the same time).
Testing will be done at a 1 mA emission current.  These tests will also
require a 100K resistor and 100K pot (to simulate the emission current
path) and a 100 ohm resistor (to provide a current path between the two grid
pins unless a second head light bulb is used to act as the grid).
<p>
WARNING: Potentially lethal voltages are present on the ion gauge
connector/cable when the controller is powered and possibly for awhile
after it is turned off!
<p>
<ul>
<li>Power up the controller with nothing attached and make sure it doesn't
 do anything terrible.  Try the filament on/off and degas functions.  Since
 there is no load, these will probably not stay on but the indicator lights
 may flash momentarily or for a second or so.  Move the range selector (if
 present) through its settings and see that the meter or display doesn't
 peg to one end - ground the input and zero it if necessary.  Enable
 autoranging (if present) and confirm that it defaults to the highest
 setting (probably if the filament is off as it is now).
<p>
<li>Power down and make sure the voltages on all the ion gauge tube pins
 have dropped to near zero.
<p>
<li>Attach the auto head light bulb to the filament pins of the ion gauge
 tube connector.  Install the 100K ohm resistor in series with the 100K ohm
 pot and put this between the filament and grid terminals.  Set the pot to
 approximately mid-range.  Install the 100 ohm resistor or your second auto
 head light bulb between the two grid pins.
<p>
<li>Power up and use a multimeter to check the bias voltages on the filament
 and grid pins.  Depending on the design of the controller, the actual voltages
 may vary but their difference should be close to the spec for the ion gauge
 tube - typically about 150 VDC positive on the grid.
<p>
<li>If the controller has a way of measuring emission directly, try it.
 With the setup as described, it should be around 1 mA (150V/150Kohms).
<p>
<li>Attempt to turn the filament on.  Depending on where the emission adjust
 pot of the controller is set, the filament may come on only momentarily, or
 for somewhat longer.  Without feedback (filament current to emission
 current), it may not be possible to keep it on but there may be a range of
 positions of the external pot and/or emission pot where the brightness of the
 filament can be varied.  This would confirm with a fair degree of confidence
 that the filament power supply regulation is functional.
<p>
<li>If a second light bulb isn't already attached to the grid, power down
 and make sure the voltages have decayed, and attach one now.  Power up and
 test out the degas function.  This is just a fixed current so as long as the
 light bulb lights, it's probably fine.
<p>
<li>Check the electrometer amplifier.  On the most sensitive ranges, just
 putting a finger near its input should evoke a response, probably pegging
 the meter on the lowest 3 or 4 settings.  More precise measurements can be
 made with a voltage source (your multimeter on ohms is adequate) and a
 selection of high value resistors configured both in series and as a
 current divider.  Note that full scale may be as little as a few hundred
 picoamps!  So, not too many electrons are required!  Similarly, check out
 the log scale if present.
<p>
 The process outputs (if present) can be checked by monitoring them while
 exercising the electrometer amplifier.
<p>
 WARNING: Depending on design, the grid bias voltage may appear on the
 electrometer input when the controller is set for Degas, even if it is not
 turned on.  Take care!
</ul>
<p>
Where the unit also includes a thermocouple vacuum gauge or gauges, these
can be tested separately either using a tester or under vacuum, and then
with the ion gauge section.
<p>
For testing a single controller, this procedure is quite satisfactory.
However, where more than one is involved, or where it is desirable to
confirm operation periodically, see the next section.

<h4><A NAME="cvasigt">Sam's Ionization Vacuum Gauge Tester</A></h4>

This is a works-in-progress.
<p>
Having done preliminary testing of my turbo pump (see the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvashvs">A Small High Vacuum System</A>), I
acquired a Granville-Phillips model 270 ion gauge controller (GP-270).
Not wanting to test this under vacuum (in part because my vacuum plumbing
isn't ready and to avoid possible damage to my limited collection of ion
gauge tubes), I decided that it would be nice to have a means of
simulating an ion gauge tube without an ion gauge tube since there
is no way to power one without a vacuum below about 1x10<sup>-3</sup>
Torr.
<p>
The circuit I'm going to build simulates the behavior of the common
Bayard-Alpert (hot filament) ion gauge tube using light bulbs and
photodiodes. :)
<p>
<ul>
<li>The ion gauge tube filament is a single filament 12 V auto head light
 bulb.  A high intensity light bulb could also be used.  This
 provides both a load to test the filament power supply as well
 as a warmup delay (due to its filament heating) to test the
 interlock circuits of the ion gauge controller.  A capacitor can
 be added to the sensing circuit to further slow down the response
 if needed.
<p>
<li>A photodiode monitoring the output of the light bulb drives
 a current source which simulates the emission current of the ion
 gauge tube.  Adjustments permit it to be set within the supported
 range of the controller (0.6 to 2.4 mA for the GP-270).
<p>
<li>The simulated emission current passes through the LED of an
 opto-coupler whose photodiode is used to provide the simulated
 ion current from the ion gauge collector electrode to the high
 sensitivity (electrometer) amplifier of the controller.
 Adjustments permit the "sensed" pressure to be varied to test
 the controller's response on each range and its autoranging
 circuits.
<p>
<li>A second light bulb is used for the grid to test the "degas" function.
<p>
 Note that a dual beam head light bulb CANNOT be used because the two
 filaments aren't isolated (for filament and grid).  Even if they had totally
 separate terminals, there might be some thermionic emission or discharge
 current flow between the two filaments of the light bulb (depending on
 whether it was evacuated or gas-filled).  At the very least, this would
 confuse the readings but might damage the controller if an actual arc
 were to take place.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Get the schematic for SG-IGT in PDF format:
 <a href="sgigtsch.pdf">SG-IGT-SCH</a>.
</ul>
<p>
All power is provided by the ion gauge controller.  While designed
specifically for the GP-270, this basic approach should work for
other ion gauge controllers.
<p>
Apparently, such things have been sold commercially,
though I don't know whether they use a similar approach.

<h3><A NAME="cvamvw">Measuring a Vacuum Without a Vacuum Gauge</A></h3>

If you are dealing with a decent vacuum, there is no real choice - a proper
vacuum gauge will be needed.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvagauge">Vacuum Gauges</A>.  However, to check the
capabilities of a compressor hooked up backwards using its suction input or
some unidentified stationary object that looks sort of like a vacuum pump,
there may be an alternative.
<p>
The easiest way is to obtain a cheap Bourdon tube type vacuum gauge.  An auto
parts store should have something suitable for $15 or less.  Or, a pressure
gauge used backwards.  (Though these won't do much good below 5 or 10 Torr -
which is where the important action is for many of the gas lasers.)  See the
section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvagauge">Vacuum Gauges</A>.
<p>
However, if it is 3:00 AM Sunday morning and you just have to get that N2
laser going, there are other options:
<p>
While I don't know of any convenient household gadget to act as a vacuum
gauge, you can determine the level of the vacuum indirectly.  A vacuum-safe
vessel (e.g., your laser tube if you don't mind getting it full of water,
a small thick-walled flask, or even a pickle jar), length of vacuum hose, and
shutoff valve, will be needed:
<p>
WARNING: See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvasaf">Safety Issues in
Working with Vacuum Systems</A> for comments on vacuum safety especially if
using a container not designed for vacuum service!
<p>
<ol>
<li>Connect everything together with the valve as close to pump as possible.
<li>Pump down the vacuum-safe vessel as best you can.
<li>Close the valve to the pump.
<li>Disconnect the vacuum hose and put it in a sink full of water.
<li>Open the valve and let the vacuum vessel suck in the water until it stops.
<li>Measure the relative amount of air and water inside (including the hose).
</ol>
<p>
The ratio of (air:total volume) is equal to the ratio of the (vacuum:1 atm).
Of course, you if the vacuum-safe vessel was your laser tube, it is now
(mostly) full of water! :(
<p>
This isn't going to be very accurate for vacuums near 1 Torr or below, but
for the N2 laser or dye laser flashlamp, it may be an adequate test to
determine if you need to go find a better pump!
<p>
Somewhat similar approaches can be used to determine (destructively) the
pressure inside things like light bulbs and flashlamps - break them in oil
under an inverted container to catch the gas bubbles and compare the bubble
volume to the total volume of the (former) lamp or whatever.
<p>
Here is another simple alternative.  Just make sure the water can't be sucked
into the pump!:
<p>
(From: James Sweet (jamessweet@hotmail.com).)
<p>
What about taking a long tube stuck in a bucket of water and dangle it
out a high window. Connect the end to the vacuum and measure how high
the water rises in the tube, that should measure fairly accurately.
Mercury would make it more practical, but a lot more dangerous.

<h4><A NAME="cvadcd">Discussion on Cheap and Dirty Vacuum Measurement</A></h4>

I was thinking that for a quick test of a vacuum pump or system, a DC or RF
source to excite a discharge inside a glass tube could be used to provide an
indication of the pressure based on brightness, color, and pattern of the
glow.
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
I don't think that can be done reliably because the various glow points are so
highly dependent on electrode shape and electron emissive coating (if
present).  In the same batch of neon electrodes, I've seen some that would go
out at 7 or 8 micron and others that would still be glowing faintly when my
micron gauge zeros.  Even a little tramp radioactive material on the
electrodes or near them will greatly affect the characteristics of the tube.
<p>
FOR A GIVEN TUBE I believe that the glow points would be repeatable.  That's
why many old neon guys got away with using that for the vacuum gauge.  That
plus neon will take a lot of abuse as long as there's no hydrocarbons in the
tube.
<p>
A TC gauge tube is fairly cheap - under $40 from Duniway.  Even if someone has
to build a homemade readout or even use a DVM, that seems like the best
solution for the money challenged.  For the REALLY cheap, I think a better
solution would be a Pirani gauge built from an industry standard lamp, say, an
automobile tail light bulb.  The Pirani gauge is a thermal conductivity gauge.
Just put the filament in a power Wheatstone bridge so that it is lit a dull
red.  Preferably with a duplicate bulb with a high vacuum in the other leg for
ambient temperature compensation.  Seal some tubulation tubing to the bulb
envelope to connect to the vacuum system.  A Pirani gauge won't go quite as
low as a TC gauge without fancy electronics but it will go a little higher,
handy for some laser projects.
<p>
The old book (Lindsay reprint) "A Manual of Vacuum Practice" by L. H. Martin
and R. D. Hill outlines briefly making Pirani gauges.  They used platinum
wire, as I recall, but a lamp should work well. You can get the book from the
<A HREF="http://www.sas.org/">Society of Amateur Scientists</A>.
<p>
(From: Sam.)
<p>
If the tube dimensions and electrode material were standardized, then
while not a substitute for any sort of <i>real</i> vacuum gauge, this should
be able to indicate the pressure to within an order of magnitude or better
at least. :)
<p>
For example, how about a 1/2 inch diameter glass tube 18 inches long excited
by a flyback based RF source such as that described in:
<A HREF="hvinvert.htm">Simple High Voltage Generator</A> with 2 inch wide
aluminum foil electrodes wrapped around the tube near each end.
(Note that a flyback transformer without a built in HV rectifier must be used
to produce an AC field.)  A low power (e.g., 5 W) true RF source would also
work.  Such a scheme eliminates the need for glass working to fuse internal
electrodes into the tube and also eliminates the issue of the type and shape
of internal electrodes.  The tube could be installed on the pump's inlet to
test just the pump or in any convenient port of a complete system.

<h4><A NAME="cvasrf">Sam's RF Discharge Color and Intensity Vacuum
 Test</A></h4>

I put together a chart of discharge appearance versus <i>estimated</i>
pressure using a two stage rotary vane vacuum pump (Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A),
my home-built TC vacuum gauge, and a lot of wild guesses.  See:
<A HREF="vacdis1.jpg">Appearance of RF Discharge in Air at Various
Pressures</A>.  These are based on an 18" length of 1/2" O.D. glass tubing
sealed at one and attached via a short length of PVC tubing to a brass "T"
with the TC gauge tube, and then via more PVC tubing to the pump inlet.
Aluminum foil electrodes about 2" long are wrapped around the glass tube
near each end and excited by my "Simple High Voltage Generator" found in the
document: <A HREF="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/samschem.htm">Various
Schematics and Diagrams</A> (with the HV rectifier removed so the output
is RF AC).  It is the same circuit shown in <A HREF="flybkrf1.gif">Flyback
Based RF Source</A>.  None of the tube dimensions or the specific RF source
or its output power fundamentally affect the general appearance of the glow
discharge.  CAUTION: At higher pressures, there may be leakage of the RF into
the TC (or other) gauge.  This doesn't seem to cause any immediate damage but
will confuse the electronics and may be bad if left on continuously.  After
noticing the meter needle moving even with the gauge turned off, I attached
the metal case of the gauge tube and its plumbing to earth ground which mostly
eliminates any noticeable effects.
<p>
CAUTION: Any serious arc or discharge that reaches the TC gauge tube elements
will likely ruin the tube and control unit.  Thus, the need to ground the
plumbing!  Locating the sensor in regions of the vacuum system away from
electrical pyrotechnics would be highly recommended!
<p>
CAUTION: This chart is <i>very approximate</i> and may be off by an order
of magnitude or more in pressure!  At intermediate pressures, there may also
be striations moving back and forth along the tube.  At very high and low
pressures, there may be variation of color along the tube and near the
electrodes.  Residual water vapor or other compounds will affect the
appearance, possibly quite significantly.  These are <b>not</b> photographs
but my attempts at rendering the appearance in LVIEWP and MSPAINT. :)  If
anyone has additions or corrections, or has a vacuum system with a calibrated
vacuum gauge and can take some decent photos of an RF discharge at
various pressures, please contact me via the

<h3><A NAME="cvasvtr">Sam's Vacuum Test Rig</A></h3>

To make a somewhat more permanent and convenient setup for testing pumps and
vacuum gauges than the one discussed above, I recycled a roll-around cart
(that used to house a small wood planar and belt sander) to vacuum duty.  It is
workbench height (about 36 inches) and about 2 feet square with two lower
shelves.  A plywood panel in front holds the power switches.  I added a wooden
frame vertically at the rear for mounting glass tubes and stuff. :)
<p>
<ul>
<li>Top surface - Hastings VT-4 (0 to 20 Torr) and VT-5 (0 to 100 microns)
 thermocouple vacuum gauge readouts.  RF generator and its Variac for
 glow discharge tests.  Space is available for other readouts or controllers
 as required.
<p>
<li>Rear frame - TC gauge tubes and sealed (at one end) glass tube for
 RF discharge tests.  Gauge tube manifold (with spare capped ports for
 additional sensors) connected to vacuum pump via 3 foot length of vacuum
 hose.  
<p>
<li>Middle shelf - Rotary vane vacuum pumps.  Currently, my Precision
 Scientific D25 clone and Welch 1399 live there.  The Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A
 would fit easily but the Welch 1402 will just have to remain on its
 wheeled platform.
<p>
<li>Bottom shelf - Storage for miscellaneous equipment and supplies.
<p>
<li>Front panel - Electrical switches for main power, pump power, and
 auxiliary (e.g., gauge) power.  Vacuum vent valve.

<h2>Vacuum Components</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cvacvs8">Vacuum Tubing</A></h3>

The flexible tubing that is used to interconnect various parts of the vacuum
system must satisfy several requirements:
<p>
<ul>
<li>It must be vacuum tight.  Gas has a way of sneaking through all sorts of
 materials under vacuum that may not seem porous under ordinary conditions.
 Thin wall tubing may leak like a sieve.
<p>
<li>It must not outgas.  Common plastics may continue to release gases which
 were precursors or used in their manufacture - that 'plastic' or new car
 smell is evidence of this.  A suitable material will have no noticeable
 odor once thoroughly cleaned.
<p>
<li>If must not collapse when evacuated - true vacuum hose is thick-walled
 and/or reinforced.
</ul>
<p>
When in doubt, test a length (e.g., a meter) by comparing the lowest pressure
achievable with your pump(s) capped by the vacuum gauge and with the tubing
in place.  The final pressure should be identical.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs9">Vacuum Seals and Sealers - Red Glyptal</A></h3>

Three types of material are used depending on the particular needs:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Removable fittings.  Joints using ground-glass to metal contact and joints
 with metal or glass and rubber O-rings require a high quality vacuum grease
 to achieve a leak-proof seal and allow for disassembly in the future.  This
 may also be desirable for use with vacuum hose connections and rubber
 stoppers.
<p>
 The usual choice is a silicone based compound appropriately called 'vacuum
 grease'.  While common lithium axle grease or Vasiline may work at modest
 levels of vacuum, there is no telling what volatile compounds these release
 to poison your laser.
<p>
<li>Permanent or semipermanent connections.  As with plumbing fixtures, a
 material may be required to fill in the fine crevices in threaded or
 compression fittings.
<p>
 When I was involved in vacuum work, the favorite was a compound called 'Red
 Glyptal' (Red Glyptal Insulating Varnish is made by General Cement.  It is
 available in small quantites from electronics distributors like Allied:
 # 796-3670, GC # 10-9002 for a two ounce bottle, and by the quart or gallon
 from chemical/scientific supply houses).  This is something like a
 thick red enamel paint and makes an excellent seal to most types of
 materials (as well as for use in impregnating and excluding moisture from
 motor and transformer windings).
<p>
 Various two-part Epoxy adhesives can also be used for permanent
 connections.  However, common hardware store Epoxy may have too high a
 vapor pressure for some gas lasers including the HeNe laser.  Slow cure
 (24 hour) hard Epoxy should be better in that regard than the 5 minute
 stuff.  The best Epoxy for use at high vacuum used to be Torr Seal(tm) which
 is acceptable, though newer better versions are probably available (see
 below).   Pulling a vacuum on any Epoxy while it's curing should also
 improve its performance later at high vacuum since the volatile components
 will already have been removed.  It's not only leakage through the seal
 that matters, but outgasing from within the sealing material.
<p>
 For threaded fittings that may need to be disassembled, white Teflon
 plumbing tape should work medium vacuums - down to well below 1 Torr.
 Vacuum grease may even have a high enough viscosity to prevent it from being
 sucked out of the threads in this case.
<p>
<li>Vacuum tight adhesives.  Where a permanent connection needs to be made AND
 secured, an Epoxy (rigid) or RTV Silicone (flexible) rubber compound may be
 used.  Note: The type of RTV Silicone compound you want does not smell like
 vineger (acetic acid) when curing as this may be corrosive.
<p>
 Torr Seal (tm) is another ultrahigh vacuum compatible cement.  It does not
 outgas and is for all practical purposes a nonconductive metal when hard - and
 that is very hard.  No common solvents will touch it so you better be really
 really sure that you want the parts connected if you use Torr Seal(tm) as they
 won't come apart - ever!  Go to <A HREF="http://www.varianinc.com/">Varian</A>
 and search for "Torr Seal".  On the resulting page will be a link to
 "Accessories".  I'd recommend the separate tubes rather than the mixing
 system unless you're coating the entire vacuum system. :)
<p>

<blockquote>
 "Hysol Epoxi-Patch is a silica dust filled high temperature low vapor
  pressure Epoxy mainly used for gluing aircraft parts together.  We use
  large amounts of it in our vacuum chambers here at the university.  Cost
  is $4.80 a box, minimum order one case at about $50 per case, 12
  boxes to the case, 4.0 ounces weight per box.  It is made by Dexter
  Corporation but is available from various sources including
  <A HREF="http://www.loctite.com/">Loctite</A>.
<p>
  We have had no problems at 1x10<sup>-6</sup> Torr once cured. I
  haven't tested it lower, but I have used it on plasma tubes and HV
  feed-throughs. Its rock hard after cure, but not so hard that it
  stresses the glass.  24 hours to cure, 1.5 hours to tack up, pretty
  thick after 10 minutes. you can hit it with a heat gun a bit to smooth
  it out and flow it into microcracks. It doesn't seem to mind elevated
  temperatures either.
<p>
  Clear nail polish around the gauge tube after you thread it in and
  while the vacuum is on. About 4 minutes later the leaks stop. 
  Dunniway sells a similar material that thickens for gauge seals and is
  high vacuum rated, but it's an expensive little bottle."
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
Scientific and vacuum supply companies should carry all of these and other
suitable products.  Your needs are quite modest compared to say, the CRT
industry, so there is no need to go overboard with ultra high vacuum sealers.
None of these lasers require anything beyond 10<sup>-3</sup> or 10<sup>-4</sup>
Torr anywhere in the vacuum system so the stuff that is guaranteed to
10<sup>-10</sup> Torr is probably a bit of overkill (but won't hurt except
in terms of cost).  Common hardware store products are really quite
satisfactory for laser tubes as long as they won't be permanently sealed.
<p>
(From: John De Armond (johngd@bellsouth.net).)
<p>
Teflon's OK to about 50 microns (0.05 Torr). Below that, Teflon outgases and
permeates too much to be useful.  I use high vacuum epoxy.  You can buy it
from Varian for about $30 per tube.  Or you can buy Hysol Engineering's
Epoxi-Patch from any industrial supply store and many hardware stores for
about $4 a package.  Same stuff.  Once cured, it's good to to least
10<sup>-6</sup> Torr and probably lower.
<p>
For lasering and neon, you really don't need fancy vacuum fittings unless
they're free.  Soldered copper pipe works well down to about 10<sup>-5</sup>
Torr or so where the tin in the solder starts to show its vapor pressure.
Cadmium free silver solder will go another decade or so.  I was recently at
the Smithsonian and saw the first cyclotrons.  Interesting to see them silver
soldered together for pressures in the 10<sup>-8</sup> Torr range or better.
All that stainless is pretty and stone cold reliable but not necessary for
experimenting.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
On my home system where I try to get to 10<sup>-8</sup> with the turbo and ion
pumps.  TC gauges are bad news, unless you buy the ones with the NKF
flanges and copper gaskets. Everything is stainless steel and brazed
and has compressible copper gaskets.  A fingerprint in that system can
mess you up. Of course it's for argon and krypton, though probably not
overkill for sealed CO2 tubes that you want to last for years.
<p>
My rule is if you're shooting for less then 10 millitorr, go all
stainless with NO threaded TCs.  Some aluminum is tolerable right at the
pumps. Glass is also acceptable, but it might shatter from turbopump
vibration.  Minimize the Swagelok stuff and TIG weld or braze
everything.  Remove the flux after brazing and wipe everything down
with acetone before putting it on station.  Stainless steel tube is
cheap if you dig around some and find a scrap dealer.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs6">Vacuum Valves</A></h3>

Two types of valves are required.  Fancy expensive types may not be needed
so you may find some of this at your local hardware store or home center.
However, since common valves are designed to operate in a positive pressure
environment, they may not hold up under vacuum conditions - or they may be
fine!  In addition, the sealing grease used may outgas at low pressure.  Some
testing will be necessary to be sure.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Shutoff valves are used to isolate a portion of the system or seal in the
  vacuum (seal out the air?).  For all intents and purposes, all that matters
  is that they be vacuum tight and can be opened or closed.  Fine control is
  not needed.
<p>
<li>Metering valves are used to allow a controlled flow of gas to enter the
  system.  There are expensive needle valves for this purpose but satisfactory
  substitutes can be made by scribing a super-fine groove around the perimeter
  of a common conical stop-cock plug.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="cvasivv">Steve's Notes on Inexpensive Vacuum Valves</A></h4>

(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Once upon a time a frustrated research tech did not want to give a ham
handed destructive grad student an expensive diamond tipped copper gasket
leak valve with a fancy micrometer on it. So I kludged, with good results:
Here are some alternatives I found useful for low and medium high vacuum 
(LHV and MHV) work.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Skinner Valve Division of Parker Hannifin, same as what Coherent uses on
 their ready-fill assemblies, to bleed small amounts of argon into a ion
 laser as needed, two valves in series, with a small chamber in between
 them and two DPDT momentary switches wired in such a way that only one can
 be on at a time.
<p>
 Skinner makes vacuum rated valves, but one I have had some success with for
 vacuum work is the B2DA1175, of which our local surplus place had many. 
 Coherent has Skinner make two valve bodies back to back, but I have found
 running 1/2" of 1/8th diameter NPT pipe between the standard valves makes a
 nice fill volume for "burping". Note in the coherent application, one hit of
 the valve with DC raises things ~100 millitorr. One trick with the Skinner
 valves is to run a DC valve on AC, they are really fast (2 to 5 milliseconds)
 and follow the AC well, chopping the gas flow down to nothing. This is why
 laser makers refer to the fill valve as a "buzz", It really does a buzz
 sound  with sharp clicks when running. When buzzed,  a fill gets closer to
 15 millitorr.
<p>
<li>Swagelok SS-3NBF-2 needle valve, I have one of these for vacuum and one
 for backfill on a plasma etcher/sputterer at work, leak rate for the 1
 cubic foot chamber is 4 torr per day, and most of that is the O-ring on the
 glass bell jar.  I use these on a system which reaches 30 microns.
<p>
<li>SwageLok SS-4N bellows valves have proven especially suitable for MHV and
 some ultra-high vacuum (UHV) as roughing valves on the chamber, they are not
 suitable for fine adjust, but their leak rate when closed approaches the
 quality of some very expensive high vacuum valves for a fraction of the cost.
 I'm using the welded bellows seal version with the 1/4" steel inlet and
 outlet tubes factory welded to the valve body  and these are widely available
 to be ripped out of surplus equipment. The round green anodized handles and
 1/4" stainless steel tubing are an instant giveaway when looking for these and
 I've yet to have a problem after 150+ operations at ~10 microns. For UHV,
 I switch to the ones with VCR fittings. 
<p>
<li>The leak valves on most flowing gas CO2 lasers are a Swagelok S series
 metering valves, a SS-S2-OH or similar, not a bellows valve, so you have
 some risk of contamination with these, but nothing that a little vacuum
 grease on the threads will not cure in most cases.  This is nice if you
 want to flow something from a fraction of a Torr to 30 Torr or so with a
 single stage Welch or other small rotary pump.
<p>
<li>NPT pipe is not really suited for vacuum work, as the threads are not 100%
 and have a taper, teflon tape really starts to outgas below 100
 microns, I found that you can make short term vacuum systems that work very
 well with NPT and lots of Teflon tape, but for keeping a stable pressure
 for more then a day you need to braze or silver solder the NPT fittings.
 Ordinary 60/40 solder has proven to leak and outgas a lot. Incidentally,
 Harris #56 "Safety-Silv" Braze, although it's made of many materials
 that like to outgas, seems to do very well for vacuum work on copper, steel
 and brass. I use the Harris "black" flux on brass and copper to stainless
 steel, and the "white" flux on stainless to stainless joints. 
<p>
 I have exposed #56 to plasma without much sputtering, yet for small
 pieces to be jointed, you can use a ordinary propane torch with the black
 flux. This is my alternative to spot welding electrodes.  At $13 an ounce
 it's not cheap, but it has proven to be the best material I have found for
 general vacuum work and brazing conflat flanges when I cannot borrow a
 TIG welder.

<h2>Vacuum System Examples</h2>
<h3><A NAME="cvacvs11">A Typical Vacuum System</A></h3>

For gas laser work, a suitable 'minimalist' vacuum system might consist of:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Vacuum pump - Well maintained (!!!) two stage rotary mechanical type.
 Typical choices are either a laboratory vacuum pump or one designed for the
 refrigeration service industry.  A small pump is fine as long as it can
 reach a vacuum of 0.1 Torr or better.  One going to only 1 Torr will be
 more than adequate for the N2 and CO2 lasers.
<p>
<li>Coarse vacuum gauge - Closed-end manometer (mercury filled).  Total tube
 height of 150 mm to read 0 to 100 Torr.
<p>
 A Bourdon tube type can be used in a pinch but accuracy will be poor at the
 low end of its range.
<p>
<li>Fine vacuum gauge - Closed-end manometer (diffusion pump oil filled).
 Total tube height of 150 mm to read 0 to 10 Torr (specific scale factor will
 depend on density of the oil compared to the density of mercury).  Valves
 on the closed end and between the two ends would permit relative pressure
 readings between the vacuum system and the laser tube to be made.
<p>
 Alternatively, a McLeod gauge can be used in place of this manometer.  A
 McLeod gauge can be more precise but will be more expensive and/or more
 difficult to fabricate (and more of a pain to use!)
<p>
<li>Cold trap - A 'U' tube in the vacuum line partially submerged in a slurry
 of dry ice and acetone, liquid nitrogen, etc., in a thermos or dewer.
<p>
<li>Gas manifold - A valve or set of valves connecting the vacuum line nearest
 the laser tube to the gas supplies.
<p>
 WARNING: High pressure gas cylinders MUST be fitted with proper regulators
 to supply low pressure gas!!!  You cannot hook a 2,000 psi gas cylinder
 directly to your laser!  Following this should be a flow restricting orifice
 (or metering valve with a small maximum size opening) followed by a relief
 valve (set for a few psi at most - just over 1 atm) to protect your glasswork
 and other low pressure tubing from 'accidents' that might have unfortunate
 consequences!
<p>
<li>Laser tube coupling - Connects the vacuum system to the laser tube (what a
 concept!).  Appropriate valves must be provided to permit the laser tube
 to be disconnected from the vacuum system if desired.
<p>
 If a diffusion pump is added (between the mechanical/roughing pump and the
 dryer), a thermocouple and/or ion gauge will also be needed.
</ul>
<p>
Also see: <A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/system.htm">A
Simple Medium Vacuum System</A> for some additional ideas on a low cost
approach to a setup that may be adequate for laser construction.

<h3><A NAME="cvashvs">A Small High Vacuum System</A></h3>

I found a more or less complete self contained high vacuum system (well, at
least the pumps) in a pile of trash headed for the dumpster.  (There was also
a Sargent-Welch 1402 two stage rotary pump in somewhat bedraggled condition
which needed a replacement shaft seal but that's a separate story.)
<p>
The system consists of:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Pfeiffer model DUO-1.5A two stage rotary vane roughing pump
 (1.5 m<sup>3</sup>/hour, 25 l/m, 0.88 cfm, ultimate vacuum better than
 6.6x10<sup>-4</sup> Torr.
<p>
<li>Pfeiffer model TPU-050 turbo-molecular high vacuum pump (50 l/s,
 1x10<sup>-9</sup> Torr with all metal construction on high-vacuum side
 or 1x10<sup>-8</sup> Torr with Viton seals.)
<p>
<li>Pfeiffer model TCP-040 controller.  This includes the switches/relays
 for the pumps, multi-phase driver for the turbopump induction motor, and
 sensors for turbopump speed and overtemp.
</ul>
<p>
Everything is mounted on an angle bracket frame.  Unfortunately, there was
no vacuum gauge which is what I really need to evaluate the condition of
this equipment.  I did find a nice brand-new Varian ion gauge tube in the
same pile of trash but no controller. :(
<p>
The complete manual for the DUO-1.5A can be found at the
<A HREF="http://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/">Pfeiffer Vacuum</A> Web site.
However, I have not been able to locate documentation on the TPU-050 though
there is a manual for a TPU-062 which appears very similar.  Nor for the
TCP-040.  If anyone has info on these, or a Duo 1.5A or Duo 2.5 (which is
the modern replacement) for sale at a really low price or trade, please contact
me via the
<A HREF="emaillnk.htm">Sci.Electronics.Repair FAQ
Email Links Page</A>.
<p>
Both these pumps are considered obsolete by Pfeiffer but the Duo 1.5A
should be usable unless some catastrophic failure occurs and parts aren't
available.  The first thing I tested was the Duo 1.5A which produced a
decent vacuum but sounded kind of funny.  See the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvadipd">Disassembling and Inspecting a Pfeiffer
Duo 1.5A Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A>.  For the TPU-050, long term operation
may be questionable since the special lubricating oil ("operating fluid" as
Pfeiffer calls it) for the lower bearing is way past its expiration date
(usually considered 2 years life even if the pump is not used).  But I first
did a quick test and applied power long enough to confirm that it started to
spin smooth as silk.
<p>
Initially, I disassembled this system and used only the Duo 1.5A for
various tests of vacuum gauges and other assorted stuff.  But, eventually
curiosity got the better of me and I decided to put everything back together
and actually test the system, turbo pump and all.  I figured that the
worst that would happen would be that the turbo pump would seize up and
explode, taking the explored Universe with it, but that's life. :)
Fortunately, I had saved all the parts in a box and finally dragged the
steel frame home.  And so I had no more excuses.
<p>
Reassembly went smoothly though interpreting some of my hand written
wiring notes was a bit of a challenge.  And, I don't have any sort of
documentation for the TCP-040 turbo pump controller but with only 3
pushbutton switches, how much could there be to mastering it!  From
what I have gathered reading the manuals for other turbo pump controllers:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pumping Unit</b> normally turns on both pumps (though I am powering
 the mechanical pump separately for testing.
<p>
<li><b>Standby</b> reduces the turbo pump speed to <i>only</i> 60,000 rpm
 when the highest high vacuum isn't needed.  This increases the ultimate
 pressure by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.
<p>
<li><b>Heater</b> applies power to the heating jacket surrounding the turbo
 pump to help outgas the interior (requires water cooling to keep the
 temperature of the lower bearing under control though).
</ul>
<p>
During preassembly testing of the TCP-040, I did find a dead fuse (not blown
but the element came off at one end) so maybe that's why it was retired.
<p>
The foreline connections are QF10 or QF16 clamped fittings with a long
stainless steel bellows hose for vibration isolation.  I had saved all
the bits so there was no problem with that part of the plumbing.  However,
I don't have a mate to the QF50 flange for the turbo pump's Conflat to
QF adapter but I had salvaged a bunch of thick stainless steel plates
from the trash, complete with O-rings, that are close enough to the
proper size to fit on top of the QF flange, clamped in place with 4 bolts.
One even had a 1/8" NPT tapped hole already there into which I installed
a manifold with three 1/8" NPT tapped holes for up to 3 thermocouple
gauge sensors.  I then installed a DV-6M (1 to 1,000 microns)
and DV-8M (0.1 to 10 microns).  These were driven with one of my pump
protector CVT-16s and the NV-8B, respectively.
<p>
Powering up the Duo 1.5A and TC gauges, the system initially would barely go
down to 500 microns.  Tightening all the QF foreline connections and plugging
up the purge valve resulted in no improvement.  I disconnected the turbo pump
outlet from the foreline and put the DV-6M there to confirm that the pump
was working fine.  It was.  I checked the Conflat flange on the turbo
pump and tightened its bolts a bit, as well as tightening the
bolts holding my improvised QF adapter.  No change.  But I did
notice that the pressure was inching down (or perhaps, more correctly
microning down!), just very slowly.  After an hour or so, it passed
150 microns.  The operating manual I have which doesn't match this
turbo pump anyhow has no specification for maximum foreline pressure,
just compression ratios.  I've seen requirements as high as 15 Torr or so
for some types but 75 to 100 microns is probably more typical for this
model.  As normally configured, the controller powers up both the mechanical
and turbo pumps at the same time so at the very least, no damage would
result from running at higher than spec'd foreline pressure.  However, for
my tests, I didn't really want the turbo pump running for longer than
necessary until I could determine that it wasn't going to self destruct.
I figured, 150 microns was close enough, and pressed the "Pumping Unit"
button on the TCP-040.
<p>
Wow, this thing really cranks!  Almost immediately, the pressure started
dropping and within a 30 seconds, was zipping past 10 microns.  In another
few seconds, the reading on the CVT-16 stopped decreasing at 2 microns (with
the turbo continuing to increase speed) and the NV-8B was pegged off scale.
I assumed the vacuum to now be close enough to perfect that the TC gauges
were at their limits.  So, of course, both the CVT-16 and NV-8B had to
be tweaked a bit using their CAL pots since this is the first time I've had
a decent vacuum to test them!  All this still not even at the 1/2 point on the
little turbo pump rotation indicator meter!
<p>
As far as I can tell, the turbo pump is working fine despite the antique
lubricating oil.  It's virtually silent and vibration-free.  Spin-up takes
a couple of minutes.  Spin-down takes at least 10 minutes.  There is no
evidence of bearing noise or heating in the vicinity of the bearings.
And the motor has no trouble reaching the maximum point on the meter
which I assume to be around 90,000 rpm.  Pressing the "Standby" switch
on the TCP-040 reduces the turbo pump speed to about 60,000 rpm (2/3rds
scale on the meter) which is still way more than I need at the moment.
While the running time of the turbo pump for these tests has been only
1/2 hour or so, the results are probably a positive sign that the explored
Universe is safe from destruction for awhile at least. :)
<p>
Since the foreline pressure is higher than what might be optimal
using a two-stage mechanical pump, the final vacuum might not reach the
turbo pump's 10<sup>-8</sup> Torr (with Viton seals) rating.  Based on
the compression ratio specs for N2, maybe <i>only</i> 10<sup>-6</sup> or
10<sup>-7</sup> Torr.  It may be limited further by the Teflon
sealing tape in the TC gauge NPT fittings.  But I can't tell
with my current assortment of vacuum gauges anyhow.  I have had a very
bedraggled Varian RG-31X combined TC and ion gauge controller for awhile
(pulled from the trash of course) but that's perhaps a bit too old even
for me (vacuum tube based).  I have recently acquired a Granville-Phillips
model 270 ion gauge controller via eBay ($60 total) and am in the process
of cobbling together a cable and vacuum plumbing to mount one of my ion gauge
tubes (yes, pulled out of the trash).  More to follow. :)
<p>
I still do not know why the foreline pressure is so high but it does
continue to drop the longer the system is run.  And when the system is shut
down and restarted, it tends to get to wherever it was before the shutdown
relatively quickly - a few minutes at most.  But if left for awhile at
1 atm, it will have to go through the long drawn out pump down cycle again.
The longer it sits at 1 atm (even if closed off to ambient conditions),
the longer it will take.  After running for several hours, it will get down
to below 20 microns, and eventually below 5 microns.  My initial assumption
was contamination inside the turbo
pump and elsewhere from just sitting around for several years in the corner
of a lab without as far as I can tell, even a dust cover for protection.
If there's a way to rinse the inside of the turbo pump with alcohol or some
other solvent without requiring replacement of the lubrication oil I might
try that eventually.  However, the idea of someone having dumped their Chinese
lunch special leftovers into the turbo pump doesn't feel right.  An external
leak is unlikely since the pressure would bottom out in a few minutes, not
slowly decrease over many hours.  The only other possibility is of a slow
internal leak.  For example, a microcrack in the turbine motor rotor or
elsewhere in the foreline section of the turbo pump that traps enough air
when at 1 atm to slowly outgas during pump down.  Yes, I know I'm grasping
at carbon nanotubes but this doesn't really make much sense. :( :)
<p>
However, the consensus now seems to be that the slow pump-down is simply due
to water vapor that gets trapped on/in the surface of the metal parts of
the system, particularly the vanes of the turbopump with their large surface
area.  Using the turbopump heater would help to reduce the time required to
purge the water vapor from there.  Filling the system with dry
nitrogen or even dry air and keeping it sealed during periods of
non-use should solve the problem. 
<p>
A high foreline pressure will directly affect the
ultimate partial pressure of low molecular weight gases like hydrogen
and helium due to their relatively poor compression ratio.  But, for air and
other heavier gases, outgassing will be the limiting factor.  For lasers
(should I ever get around to actually using this rig!), the only situation
where it might matter would be purging unwanted hydrogen from the system
but introducing the desired laser gas(es) should do that quite efficiently
without much assistance.

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs10">Leaks and Leak Testing</A></h3>

For our simple vacuum system, leak testing is usually self evident - there are
only a few places where leaks can develop.  Using new decent quality components
(not garden hose or 30 year old rubber stoppers!) and care in assembly with
proper sealers will avoid most leaks.  However, note that very small leaks (by
the macroscopic standards most people are familiar with) can result in mediocre
performance even for these low to medium vacuum systems even if your pump can
go down to 0.1 micron.
<p>
Note that failure of a vacuum system to reach an acceptable pressure even with
a pump in most excellent condition may be a result of many factors, only one
of which are actual leaks (i.e., holes in the system somewhere).  Adsorbed and
absorbed materials, organic contamination (e.g., fingerprints), and trapped
gases in screw threads or other crevices, can all result in slow pump-down but
will go away if you wait long enough.  Thus, if the pressure continues to
decrease on average (there could be times where pockets of "stuff" are released
and pressure may rise slightly), one or more of these fake leaks may be
present. :)  Once successfully pumped down, if the system is allowed to lose
vacuum, immediate pump-down will probably be much faster.  However, let it
sit at atmosphere for any length of time, and all those undesirable nooks and
crannies will fill up again, or water vapor will get stuck on surfaces.
Even a short length of tubing or a single threaded fitting can trap a lot
of contaminants which will become a pregressively greater problem at
pressures below a few hundred microns.  Use of inappropriate materials
for seals and tubing can of course also result in poor performance.
<p>
The following deals mostly actual hole-type leaks. :)  There are a number of
approaches to leak testing:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Where possible, seal off various parts of the system until you locate one
 which affects the pressure.  This is pretty easy where flexible tubing
 is used to connect components (just pinch the tubing).
<p>
<li>Tesla coil.  A special hand-held spark coil (actually called an Oudin
 coil) may be passed over suspect parts of the apparatus.   Its discharge
 will be 'attracted' to a leak since this represents a path to ground through
 the residual gas inside the system.  However, an Oudin coil won't work around
 metal components since they will attract the discharge even if there is a
 hole you could drive a truck through nearby!  CAUTION: Don't set the voltage
 too high or you may puncture thin glass, plastic, or rubber parts and create
 leaks.
<p>
<li>Water or oil test.  Spray some water (or something else) over suspect
 joints as the pump is running.  If a slow leak is present, the pressure
 will drop while the relatively 'thick' liquid is being sucked through the
 hole.  If a solution of something like shellac dissolved in alcohol is
 painted on instead, in addition to the immediate effects, the solvent will
 quickly evaporate in the vacuum and what remains will plug the leak.  A
 commercial product like Red Glyptal can be used for this.  Epoxy/Torr Seal
 might also work but not being solvent based, it won't solidify immediately
 and there is a risk that it will just get sucked through the hole to
 reappear inside your vacuum vessel!  Other examples are VACSEAL or
 VACSEAL II available from
 <A HREF="http://www.2spi.com/catalog/vac/vacumain.html">SPI Supplies</A>.
<p>
<li>Gas leak detector.  Since the presense of trace amounts of some gases will
 change the color of an electrical discharge dramatically, this provides a
 means of detecting a leak in a system where a DC or RF electrical discharge
 can be generated.  A probe releasing a small amount of a tracer gas
 is run over the apparatus until the color of a discharge inside the tubing
 changes color.  However, this may not be too effective for very small leaks.
<p>
<li>Helium leak detector.  For high vacuum work where budget is no option, this
 is for you!  A special purpose sensor (actually a mass spectrometer tuned to
 the helium atom) is connected to the system.  Instead of a color change, the
 traces of helium drive a meter or activate an annunciator.  Simple, huh?
</ul>
<p>
And, not all leaks are undesirable.  Controlled leaks are used to admit
precise quantities of gases into vacuum systems and in particular, gas
lasers.  For more than you probably wanted to know about leaks, see the
Electronic Bell Jar article:
<A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/71leaks.pdf">Leaks: The
Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</A>.
<p>
(From: Steve Roberts (osteven@akrobiz.com).)
<p>
Ah, the age old question: "Is it a leak or water vapor?".   I let my vacuum
system sit without argon backfill for about 3 months.  Tried to run it and
couldn't get low enough to start the turbopump at 100 microns without heat
tapes.  Took 2 hours to get there with heat after trying for a few hours
without it. Couldn't even think of starting the ion pump at that point
either, turbo was moaning with load.   If you run a system on a day-to-day
basis like I do here at the university, you start to see the water hangup at
100 to 200 microns every day, since we've been a few days having 90% humidity,
it's gotten worse.
<p>
First quick test: Carefully heat areas of the system (that can take it) with
a propane torch.  If the roughing pump nearly stalls when you heat certain
places, it's water vapor.  Only other thing that has that kind of
vapor pressure would be something like formaldehyde.  Second quick test
if there is a part of the system that can sustain an electrical discharge
(DC, AC, RF, Oiden coil, etc.) like a portion of glass tubing: Water
vapor is has an orange discharge color at high pressure.
<p>
(From: Jeff Miller).)
<p>
I have found I can detect and pinpoint about %98 of real vacuum leaks using
helium and virtually any indirect reading vacuum gauge suitable for the
range of interest.  This is due to the fact that helium has thermal,
viscosity, and ionization characteristics wildly different from that of
air.  Four factors largely determine success.
<p>
<ol>
<li>The gauge must be suited to the range of interest.  If you suspect a
 leak is causing 1 to 100 microns of trouble, use a thermal gauge.  If you
 suspect it's causing 1x10E-7 worth of trouble, use a hot cathode gauge.
<p>
<li>All other factors contributing to base pressure must be minimized.
 Usually this means that out-gassing must be complete.  This can take hours
 or days.  If this is not done, the readings generally drift too much or the
 leak is simply overwhelmed by the out-gassing.
<p>
<li>The resolution of the
 gauge should be enhanced, if possible, very much beyond what would
 otherwise be considered sensible given the accuracy of the underlying
 technology.  A 4.5 digit DVM in series or parallel with the analog readout
 of a traditional vacuum gauge is a good example.
<p>
<li>The stability of the
 gauge should be enhanced if possible.  Many of the simpler analog TC gauges
 are surprisingly sensitive to line voltage variations, a constant voltage
 transformer might be needed if your line is given to periodic variations.
 And whose isn't?  You might also consider some light insulation around your
 thermocouple tube - just enough to protect it from cool breezes or a hot
 breath.  And, it should be isolated from vibration or other movement.
</ol>
<p>
I've seen this technique mentioned here and there, but not nearly as often
nor recommended as highly as it should be.  I have a helium leak detector
but very rarely fire it up because this technique is so effective.  I
haven't tried it with a discharge tube type gauge but I suspect it should
work to some degree.

<h2>Sources for Vacuum Equipment and Supplies</h2>

As noted elsewhere, your local home-center, hardware store - and scrap yard,
can provide everything from plumbing fittings and tubing to refrigeration
compressors.  However, to find serious vacuum pump equipment, you may have to
buy from a scientific or industrial supply house or surplus outlet.  There you
will find vacuum pumps of all types and sizes, vacuum gauges, vacuum fittings,
valves, sealers, etc.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vacuum equipment manufacturers/suppliers:</b> Many firms offer new,
 used, and rebuilt vacuum pumps as well as rebuild kits for an old pump you may
 have picked up cheap at a yard sale.  Here are a few sites to check out for
 vacuum equipment (including pumps and gauges) and supplies.  Many of these
 companies also have useful technical information on their Web sites.

 Some, like Pfeiffer and Welch, have complete manuals and/or exploded diagrams
 and parts lists for their equipment which may be downloaded for free (useful
 for that pump you found in Grandma's attic).  Precision Plus sells repair
 kits and parts for hundreds of pump models and has schematics (exploded
 diagrams) for a variety of vacuum pumps from various manufacturers, though
 it's far from a complete set.
<p>
 PTB Sales has a <A HREF="http://www.ptb-sales.com/manuals/">Manuals
 Directory</A>.  I don't know if these manuals are accessible directly
 from the respective equipment pages.
<p>
 There are also many vacuum technology related companies at
 <A HREF="http://www.belljar.net/supply.htm">The Bell Jar -
 Suppliers Page</A> and another one linked from
 <A HREF="http://www.ee.ualberta.ca/~schmaus/vacf/">The Vacuum Technology
 Page (ECE Department, University of Alberta)</A>.
<p>
 A quick Internet search or business directory should turn up numerous other
 possibilities as well as sources for used equipment (see below).
<p>
<li><b>Surplus dealers (Internet or other):</b> It isn't necessary to buy
 vacuum pumps or accessories like vacuum gauges new or from name brand vacuum
 equipment suppliers (vacuum pump oil is another story!).  There is a lot of
 "previously owned" vacuum equipment available at a fraction of the new cost.
 Used vacuum pumps and used vacuum gauges are just fine as long as they work
 (and aren't contaminated with something that would get your basement declared
 a HASMAT zone!).  A typical discount will be 40 to 60 percent but much higher
 ones may be available for some items, especially those that are considered
 obsolete by today's standards.  Keep in mind that the sort of vacuum required
 for the most finicky of home-built lasers was state-of-the-art sometime
 during the 19th century. :)  A Net search for the item(s) you're interested
 will often turn up dealers of both new and used equipment, often with
 prices listed.  Here are a very few of the possibilities:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><A HREF="http://www.oetech.com/vac20_24.html">OE Technologies</A>
 <li><A HREF="http://www.parallax-tech.com/miscsale.htm">Parallax Technology,
  Inc.</A>
 <li><A HREF="http://www.junktronix.com/svss/">Silicon Valley Surplus Sources</A>
 </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Refurbished equipment suppliers:</b> Similar to surplus but these
 are (supposed to be) totally rebuilt and will probably have a new paint
 job as well. :)  With a decent guarantee, the price will be higher but
 still likely to be less than 1/2 of new.  Here's one that Google found:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li><A HREF="http://www.emcgrath.com/catalog/vacuum/">E. MgGrath, Inc.
  Vacuum Directory</A>
 </ul>
<p>
 They list a wide variety of vacuum equipment with prices.  (I used the
 directory link because their catalog seems to be a bit messed up.)
<p>
<li><b>Internet classifieds and auctions:</b> Equipment of this sort
 occasionally shows up in the for-sale postings in various laser and
 electronics related newsgroups and other on-line forums.  See the section:
 <A HREF="laserlir.htm#lirnld">Newsgroups, Discussion Groups and Technical
 Forums, Listservers</A> and in on-line auctions.  For example,
 try a search for "vacuum pumps" (or even for a specific model) at
 <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</A>.  There are always dozens of vacuum
 pumps listed there.  I've seen very nice ones go for less than $100.  Of
 course, shipping may be significant but the total will still end up being
 only a fraction of the cost for a new refrigeration service pump or a smaller
 fraction of the cost for a new lab vacuum pump.  However, become familiar
 with the way vacuum pumps are rated before bidding on the first one you
 come across.  Just because the words "vacuum" and "pump" are in the listing
 doesn't mean it will be useful for a laser!
<p>
<li><b>Salvage yards, high-tech flea markets, estate sales, public
 auctions:</b> This will be more hit or miss but if you enjoy scrounging,
 finding a suitable pump shouldn't be difficult.  Even common garage and
 yard sales may be productive but it could take a few years to find that
 gem. :)
<p>
<li><b>Neon sign shops:</b> Vacuum pumps at these places are worked hard so
 what they are willing to sell or give away may need some work - or maybe just
 and oil change!
<p>
<li><b>High school science departments:</b> Check with the chemistry and
 physics teachers.  There's no telling what's sitting in a long neglected
 storage room.  At my high school, they had an antique rotary vane vacuum
 pump, brass trim and all, that I was able to borrow for awhile.  It worked
 fine.
<p>
<li><b>University science and engineering labs:</b> Vacuum (and other)
 equipment often becomes "excess" as research grants come and go.  While
 actually throwing major equipment away isn't that common, it may be sent
 to "storage" which for all intents and purposes, is the same as far as the
 people in charge.  (The paperwork would have been too much effort to actually
 dispose of it outright.).  Become friendly with the professors at each lab -
 or better yet and perhaps easier, the students who work there since they will
 know how to deal with the faculty member who is supposed to be running the
 place.  Describe what you want to do and your needs.  Or, if there is
 something sitting around obviously gathering dust that they won't give away
 because the bean counters might object, you may be able to at least borrow
 it for the duration of your interest in home-built lasers freeing up valuable
 lab space - which may be the most important thing to emphasize in your
 request!
</ul>
<p>
Note that a pump previously used in high vacuum service (e.g., semiconductor
fab, ion beam sputtering, mass spectrometer, electron microscope, etc.) is
likely to be in much better condition than the identical model and age pump
used for refrigeration service since in addition to being in a much better
environment, most of the time it is just maintaining the rough vacuum for
the system, not actually pumping significant amounts of vapors.  Refrigeration
pumps suck all sorts of crud including moisture laden air which contaminates
the oil leading to the formation of coatings that even multiple flushing may
not remove and can even result in rusting of internal parts.
<p>
But, how do you determine the condition of a pump from a photo or description,
or even looking at it without testing its operation?  The quick answer is:
It's difficult.  A pump in a totally a dirty, greasy, sorry state could work
perfectly.  One that looks brand-new my have ingested some ball bearings and
have major mechanical problems which caused it to be replaced.  Obviously, if
the owner or seller has tested the pump for ultimate vacuum and offers a
guarantee, that is better than one that is sold as-is.  But if they claim
that "this pump creates a perfect vacuum in a gallon pickle jar in 10 seconds",
move on to another pump since they have no idea of what they are talking
about. :)  Only rarely will there be an indication of a problem like a tag
which reads: "This pump leaks oil all over the place". And that in itself
isn't really bad - oil seals are replaceable.  Even without a tag, a pump
that has had its oil drained may operate perfectly having been taken out
of service only because it leaked oil all over the place!  I was given
one of those (minus the tag) - an Ulvac Sinku-Kiko G-50D and it currently
is my best performing pump but it does leak enough oil to be annoying, if
not quite all over the place! :)
<p>
Note that I have picked up vacuum pumps at garage sales including a somewhat
bedraggled but functional pump that had been used in refrigeration service
for $15 (it is identical to a Precision Scientific D25 - the model number
isn't legible, but the name on it is Madden Brass Company, a division of
Robinaire), a Welch 1399 that appeared to be in mint condition for $8.  But,
I passed up a larger two stage rotary pump at a garage sale (Darn!) probably
because it was too heavy to move (it would really have been only $5!).  I've
also found a high vacuum rig including a Pfeiffer Duo 1.5 rotary vane pump and
TPU-050 turbo pump in the (University) trash (see the section:
<A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvashvs">A Small High Vacuum System</A>), along with
a Welch 1402.
<p>
And, a few months later, I found <i>another</i> 1402 in the university trash,
very dusty but apparently in otherwise good condition!  I also managed to
snag a 1405 prior to a lab renovation.  I also bought (can you imagine that!)
a second Pfeiffer Duo 1.5A on eBay to compare.  I suspect my basement would
be full of vacuum pumps if I lived near a monthly high tech flea market.
Come to think of it, my basement <i>is</i> already full of vacuum pumps! :)
So, recently, when I spotted yet another university castoff homeless 1402,
I concluded that enough is enough and they are so darn heavy!
<p>
Here's the rundown:
<p>
<ul>
<li>I changed the oil in the first Duo 1.5A mainly because it looked dreadful
 and this pump now goes below 4 microns.  I don't know how well it would have
 done with the old ugly oil. :)  Later, I flushed it and changed the oil again.
 The base pressure didn't improve that much but the difference between hot
 and cooled is not quite small.
<p>
<li>The first 1402 required a shaft seal replacement to prevent it from
 dripping all over the floor.  With its original oil, it went as low as
 3.5 microns when cold but the pressure would gradually creep up to 10
 microns and beyond as the pump got hot and the oil outgassed.  After
 an oil change (but no flushing as I didn't have any flushing fluid at
 the time), it holds below 3 microns (below 2 microns if kept cool).
<p>
<li>The D25 would only do about 150 microns despite the fact that it's
 a two-stage pump.  However, I did find a problem and with an improvised
 but effective repair it now goes down to about 3 microns after flushing and an
 oil change.  See the section: A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvapsd25">Rehabilitating
 a Precision Scientific D25 Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A>.
<p>
<li>The single-stage 1399 went below 50 microns after it was run with its
 gas ballast valve open for awhile to purge the old oil of trapped vapors.
 It also had a peculiarity that the pressure wouldn't go below several hundred
 microns until it had warmed up for about 5 minutes.  My suspicion is that
 one of the vanes is sticking due to gum/varnish on the rotor and a flushing
 might remedy this.  However, I did find that the original oil was of very
 high viscosity (for unknown reasons) and after the flushing and oil change
 with the proper oil, this condition while not totally elminated, occurs
 for a shorter time.   And the base pressure is now below 25 microns.
 Out of curiosity more than anything else, I did go inside.  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvadiw1">Disassembling and Inspecting a Welch 1399
 Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump</A>.
<p>
<li>The Ulvac Sinku-Kiko G-50D is a nice direct-drive two stage pump that
 aside from the oil leak, achieves the lowest base pressure of the lot
 after flushing and a double oil change - better than 0.3 microns.  I'd
 really like to replace the shaft seal but it looks like it will be a pain.
 See the section: <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvaskulv">Ulvac Direct Drive Rotary
 Vane Vacuum Pump With Leaky Shaft Seal</A>.
<p>
<li>Initially I only tested the turbo pump to confirm that it starts
 to spin.  Since this model is no longer supported - and I couldn't afford
 parts for it in any case - there may be no practical way of running it with
 any assurance of long term reliability since the bottom bearing oil pack is
 no doubt way past its 2 year shelf and service life.  However, I have
 recently tested it at full speed.  See the section:
 <A HREF="lasercva.htm#cvashvs">A Small High Vacuum System</A>.
<p>
<li>The shaft seal on the second 1402 seems fine and it goes down to about
 6 microns with the original oil.  The inlet cover gasket may be leaking
 slightly as I removed the cover to check for debris in the inlet filter
 but didn't have a replacemnt.
<p>
<li>The second Duo 1.5A had no real problems other than its base needing a
 paint job and rubber feet. :)  Even the original oil seems to be in like-new
 condition.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="cvacvs13">Considerations for Gas Laser Filling/Regassing</A></h3>

To a large extent, the life expectancy of a HeNe or other low pressure gas
laser will be heavily dependent on the cleanliness of the interior of the
tube and all its constituent parts, and the purity of the final gas fill.
Therefore, while it may be possible to use a marginal vacuum system and less
than super pure gases with common basement workshop conditions to get a
home-built laser to work for a short time, don't expect optimum output power
or stability and a useful lifetime for such a tube if sealed off to be more
than a few dozen hours, if that!
<p>
The following comments come from someone who has experience with both HeNe and
ion laser refurbishing:
<p>
Letting a HeNe laser tube up to air outside of a inert gas glove box is not
a good idea.  A class 1000 or better clean room environment with HEPA filtered
inert gas is really needed.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The getters will form a nice fine powder that can't be removed.  This will
 interact with the plasma.  What you will get is a plasma cannon that shoots
 a stream of plasma seeded with barium oxide or a titanium compound right at
 the mirrors.  I have watched a dusty tube with a plasma jet etch a Brewster
 window from the back side in a ion laser, that tube was shot in just a few
 minutes. 
<p>
<li>The dust on the optics from a normal room environment kills lasing entirely
 or results in chaotic low power lasing.  These particles result in a very
 unstable plasma.
<p>
<li>The gases must be pure.  That means you have to have extremely dry gas
 with no oxygen or water vapor or CO2 or other organics.  Water vapor is
 extremely hard to pump, and kills lasing like there is no tomorrow.  A
 mechanical pump will never get rid of it, and getters can barely keep up
 with it.  Odds are that anything less then a modern high vacuum Epoxy won't
 handle the bake-out required either. One wonders if it will even cure in a
 dry inert atmosphere.
<p>
<li>The fill gas for short lasers must be isotopic, a small lecture
 bottle of the proper isotopes is currently at least $800 with a proper
 regulator. Not to mention that most modern gas bottle regulators will "run
 away" full open when exposed to a vacuum.  Both of mine do.  Not using
 isotopic gases in a HeNe laser will result in at least a 30% power loss.
 This, coupled with the poor vacuum facilities of the average amateur, means
 that any resulting laser tube would be just a experiment, not something you
 could seal off and use.  
<p>
<li>10<sup>-2</sup> Torr isn't enough vacuum.  You'll find yourself replacing
 windows frequently, or have a sputtering HeNe laser that will only last 10
 to 20 hours if sealed off.  What is needed is 10<sup>-6</sup> or better, and
 that should be the measured gauge pressure, not the rating on the side of
 the pump!  A cold trap and a cryo trap are a must, and a gauge capable of
 measuring down to this range (e.g., ion gauge) is needed but without it
 you are blind.  Thermocouple gauges don't do well below 10<sup>-3</sup> Torr.
<p>
<li>And for those of you ion laser fans using Kovar, lead, silver, tin, brass,
 iron, or aluminum in your vacuum system or as part of a tube will probably
 result in a poisoned cathode and short life if the plasma or hot gas can
 touch it.  Note that eliminates most available solders and many brazes;
 indium-gold is one of the few brazes that will work.  
</ul>
<p>
The main things that determine your power are: correct Brewster window angle
and material (for external mirror tubes), ultra clean optics, and clean gas
fill.  We're talking cleaner then cleanroom clean - better than the best
surgical suite - semiconductor manufacturing type clean!
<p>
For an argon ion laser the same cathode is often used on a 1 watt tube as in a
20 watt one - same size made by the same company.  A cathode isn't just a
helix of pure tungstan wire.  It has a lot of different compounds sintered
into it when it's made and is more like a hollow sponge if you look at it under
an electron microscope. What's in the sponge is a secret and what you have to
do to get the sponge in the right shape for use is another secret.  Remember,
chemicals and elements can undergo changes in state or composition with
changes in temperature and pressure. 
<p>
Its not as easy as the Scientific American stuff says it is, Vacuum processing
is an art for a SEALED OFF tube that is going to last awhile.  In addition to
the actual laser gas or gas mix, there is often xenon, oxygen, and hydrogen on
the pump station and each has its own use in cleaning up a tube. For a tube
that never leaves the pump, like most home-built lasers, you can put in a fresh
fill and flush away dirt.  But that sponge in a commercial tube is not so
willing to give up all its dirt so certain things have to be done with
different gases to make it clean up and emit electrons.  How that is done
is the real heart of cleaning up a tube.  And, the tube gets temperature
cycled up and down almost a thousand degrees several times so what you can't
pump out you burn off.
<p>
The Scientific American Lasers can be built for around perhaps $1,000 each
using scrounged equipment.  However, their lifetime is measured in hours and
they can tolerate leaks, impure gas, etc. But you can never turn your back on
them or leave them alone as they require constant attention or they will fail.
A basic vacuum/gas fill/bakeoff station to do a commercial tube might cost
$300,000 if bought new but the resulting laser tube will last years. That's a
BIG difference.
<p>
If you were ever to crack the seal on a commercial tube, you probably never
could seal it off again, so at best it's an experiment.  That's the difference
between research/play and work.  Thus, don't try this if you only have one
tube to risk!

<h3><A NAME="cvamnvs">Mark's Notes on Vacuum Systems</A></h3>

(From: Mark Dinsmore (dinsmore@ma.ultranet.com).)
<p>
Just thought I would throw in a bit of my experience with vacuum systems.  My
job involves making miniature thermionic cathode X-ray tubes, so I've had my
share of vacuum traumas.
<p>
First note - be aware that the high pressure electronic vacuum gauges may have
a verrrry different calibration when you get helium involved.  If this is the
same type I'm familiar with, they work by sensing heat lost by convection and
conduction through the gas.  Helium has a phenomenal heat conductivity, and
can throw of the calibration by orders of magnitude.  Second, be aware that
all it takes is ONE arc into your gauge, and there goes the controller and
probably the sensor (voice of experience).
<p>
If you want to use the electronic gauge, you need to calibrate it against a
closed-end manometer using the laser mix gas.  Helium is a very good heat
conductor, while carbon dioxide is a better insulator than air.  With so much
helium, I think that it's conductivity will dominate.
<p>
You can use this heat conductive quality of helium, and its much greater
conductivity through small orifices, to trace leaks.  Just pump your system
down as low as it will go with your electronic vacuum gauge hooked up, and
spray a little helium at all the suspicious points in your system.  If you see
the needle on your vacuum gauge twitch, you're close to the leak.  If you see
a slow rise, it may be permeation through rubber or some elastomer.  Helium
has orders of magnitude more permeation through these substances than air.
<p>
You also can CAREFULLY (no flames or high voltage on!!!) dribble a little pure
isopropyl alcohol over the suspect joints.  The alcohol will penetrate the
fissure, freeze on expansion, and temporarily seal the joint.  Wait a few
minutes, and the leak will reappear.

<h3><A NAME="cvaifhb">Inexpensive Filters for Home-Built Gas Lasers</A></h3>

The suggestion below is perhaps a bit of overkill and definitely messy.
Alternatives include the absolute sub-micron filters in (dead or obsolete)
hard drives and I would think that cotton or filter paper should actually
be more than adequate.
<p>
(From Daniel Ames (Dlames2@msn.com).)
<p>
Since most of us amateur laser constructors do not have a class-5 clean
room to build our lasers in, here is a tip or option for helping to keep
those home built (gas) lasers cleaner inside the cavity.
<p>
What is really needed is a very fine filter just before the gas inlet or
port to the cavity, but the commercial ones are very expensive, so if
you need one on a budget, look towards yours or your neighbor's ink
jet printer cartridges - the empty ones.
<p>
So, what's inside an ink jet cartridge that can be used for a home
brewed - gas laser? Glad you ask, the answer is ultra fine (round)
screen like filter, one large one in the black, and 3 or 4 in the color
cartridges. My Lexmark printer's cartridges contain one 11 mm diameter filter
in the bottom, and the color cartridge contains three smaller ones, about 6 mm
diameter. The mesh size of these ink filters are so incredibly fine, that the
beam from a 7 mw HeNe will not pass through it. Their appearance looks like
stainless steel. Note: many ink cartridges use the water-soluble ink,
this works well for cleaning off the old ink.
<p>
They come out of the cartridge pretty easy, just be sure to wear some
disposable gloves and do this when either your wife, husband or mother
is not home. :)
<p>
First, you'll need to pull out the ink sponges by popping the top cap
off the cartridge.
<p>
Rinse out the remaining ink.
<p>
Now cut the bottom of the cartridge off, below the bottom of the ink
well to expose the hole below the ink filter.
<p>
Then, insert a blunt object into that hole in the bottom and gently push
the filter out. It seams like they are slightly fused onto their
mounting post. There will probably be a little residue where it was
secured to the plastic mounting, this can easily be cut off, nice and
clean by sharpening one end a round metal tube that has the ID that you
need. Then, just lay the filter on some hard wood, or plastic, (not the
kitchen counter) center the tube punch coaxially with the filter and
tap the tube with a hammer to cut the filter.
<p>
As for how to mount this newly found ultra fine filter, you could push
it into a metal tube, then using a tubing cutter, like the ones used for
refrigeration & air conditioning, make two genital indented rings on the
tube, one on each side of the filter and as close as possible to it. I'm
sure your creativity can come up with more ways to install this filter
into your lasers.
