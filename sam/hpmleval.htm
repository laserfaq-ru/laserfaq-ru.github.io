<h2>Abstract</h2>

Agilent Technologies <A HREF="#ref">[1]</A>
(formerly Hewlett Packard or HP)
is perhaps the leading supplier of
two-frequency HeNe metrology lasers. used in all areas of precision
manufacturing.  The most well known application is probably for
sub-micron positioning in semiconductor wafer steppers.  These lasers
generally have a long life (50,000 hours typical) but when they do fail,
replacement with a new laser at relatively high cost ($9,000 and up) has
always been the low risk option for critical applications.  However,
these lasers are also available surplus (used or "preowned") often at very
attractive prices but nearly always in unknown operating condition with
equally unknown life expectancy.  And, a few companies do claim to offer
rebuild services or rebuilt lasers at greatly reduced cost compared to
a new one.  This note addresses the issues that might arise with a
used or rebuilt laser, and their impact on measurement precision
and service life.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

HP/Agilent metrology lasers are Helium-Neon (HeNe) lasers that use
an axial magnetic field to split a single longitudinal lasing mode into
two modes that are orthogonally polarized and offset in optical frequency
from each-other by several MHz. <A HREF="#ref">[2]</A>
One component called the "measurement
beam" is sent to a remote "Test Arm" whose position is
to be measured and returned via a mirror or retro-reflector, while the other
component called the "reference beam" is returned locally from a fixed
retroreflector.  These are combined in a high speed photodiode producing a
beat signal via heterodyning.  When the Test Arm moves, it results in a
Doppler shift changing this beat frequency.  By comparing the phase of
the beat signal (called MEAS) with a locally generated un-shifted
version (called REF), the position of the Test Arm can be
determined down to a resolution of 10 nanometers (nm) or better.  And,
through computation and/or special optics, velocity, angle, straightness,
and other measurements can be made with similar precision.
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="inter2f.gif"><img  WIDTH=791  src="inter2f.gif" border=0></A>
</center>
<p>
The Test Arm may be a tool in a CNC milling machine, a stage in a
semiconductor wafer stepper, a voice coil positioner in a hard
drive servo writer, or any number of other precision devices.
A single laser can be used with many independent measurement axes
through the use of beamsplitters, separate interferometer optics and
optical receivers, and associated digital processing channels.
<p>
The key attributes that make these lasers ideal for metrology applications are
that they produce two frequency components a few MHz apart that are linearly
polarized, orthogonal, and oriented along the X and Y axes (horizontal and
vertical) relative to the laser baseplate.  The optical frequencies are highly
stable and the corresponding wavelength (the actual "yard stick") thus should
be as well.  And, they remain stable for the life of the laser without
any maintenance.  (However, environmental factors like temperature, pressure,
and humidity must to be taken into consideration as
they have a significant effect on wavelength.)
Since the two frequencies originate from the same laser
cavity as a TEM00 (single spatial) mode beam, they are
inherently perfectly aligned with each-other, something not necessarily
true of alternative techniques using other means such as an Acousto-Optic
Modulator (AOM) to generate the second frequency component.

A typical 5517B laser with its covers removed is shown below:

<h3>HP-5517B Laser Showing Tube Assembly on the Left and Analog Control PCB on
  the Right</h3> 
</center>
<p>
The heart of HP/Agilent two-frequency lasers is the
custom HeNe laser tube assembly, which represents most of the cost of the
laser.  When the heart degrades to the point of making the laser unusable
or dead, the choices are either to obtain a replacement laser, or to do
a heart transplant, or a rebuild.  The transplant
is simple, quick, and low risk: Find a good tube assembly in a laser
that is broken for some other reason and pop it into a chassis with
good electronics.  Only one trivial adjustment is required.  Problem
solved.  However, there's one slight difficulty with this approach:
HP/Agilent lasers don't often fail for reasons other than the tube,
and when they do, repair is generally very straightforward.  So, there
isn't a huge availability of good tubes in bad lasers.
<p>
Used HP/Agilent metrology lasers are also widely available.  But many of
these are already unusable due to low output power or other problems
with the tube.  Thus, finding one with both acceptable performance and
adequate life expectancy requires a knowledge of what to look for and
what tests to perform.
<p>
These lasers are often run 24/7 from the day they are installed until
the day they die or fail preventive maintenence checks.  Such lasers
invariably find their way to eBay and unscrupulous sellers will either
claim the "came from a working environment" or an inability to test them.
The working environment claim may not be inaccurate, it's just that
the laser was pulled because <i>it</i> was dead, not that the line
was shut down! :)  However, if a seller is reputable, has performed a
few basic tests, and offers a warranty (even a relatively short one
giving the buyer an opportunity to more fully test it),
then a previously owned unit may be perfectly acceptable with low risk.
Even where it has failed for other reasons like a bad HeNe laser power
supply, a broken laser with a good tube may be easily repaired.
<p>
However, if it were possible to rebuild a bad tube,
then this opens up a third possibility with performance potentially
equal to that of a new laser at a fraction of the cost.
When done properly, the laser would perform essentially like new and
have a decent life expectancy (though possibly not as long as that
of the original long-lived custom HP/Agilent tube).
<p>
A photo of a typical tube assembly removed from an HP laser is shown below:

<h3>Tube Assembly from HP-5517B Laser</h3>

<p>
And a diagram of the internal structure of a typical tube assembly is
shown below:

<A HREF="hp5517t1.gif"><img  WIDTH=900  src="hp5517t1.gif" border=0></A>
</center>
<p>
The tube assemblies in all other 5517 lasers except the 5517A are similar.
This is also true of the 5501B.  The 5517A, as well as the 5518A/B and 5519A
tube assemblies have a single-piece cast-metal casing with keying
pegs to mount in their enclosures with no alignment.  But the glass
laser tube, magnet, and optical components in these are similar to those
in the other 5517s.  The very old 5501A, and even older 5500A/C lasers
used tube assemblies that were quite different with PieZo Transducer
(PZT) tuning rather than thermal tuning, rebuild options for
these would likely be limited to regasing since the PZT tuning can't
easily be replicated with a common commercial HeNe laser tube.
However, most of the functional issues dealt with below would also apply
to them as well.  And in most applications, the 5501B is a
drop-in replacement for the 5501A, so it's unlikely that anyone will
consider rebuilding the older lasers commercially.  Very few
5500A/Cs are still in use providing even less justification
for rebuilding them.  However used 5500A/Cs and 5501As may be
desirable for people wanting to keep legacy systems running
with minimal effort and cost.

<h2>Used ("Previously Owned") HP/Agilent Metrology Lasers</h2>

For many applications, a very viable alternative is to purchase a used laser.
Assuming such a laser hasn't been modified or tampered with (or rebuilt!),
then most of the issues associated with rebuilt lasers will not exist.
Only two parameters really change significantly with use and these are
the laser output power (which declines, especially towards end-of-life)
and to a lesser extent, the REF (split) frequency (which tends to increase
slightly as a side effect of the decrease in output power).  The principle
remaining issue would be that the laser tube starts reasonably quickly
and runs reliably without any dropout, sputtering, or flickering; and
that it will continue to do so with an acceptable lifespan.  I do not
know if the newest Agilent lasers with the Digital Control PCBs have
run-time meters, but those with Analog Control PCBs do NOT (and this
includes all Hewlett Packard lasers).  However, it's generally possible
to get a good feel for the health and expected remaining life of any
given unit through simple tests and comparison of output power and
REF (split) frequency with the measured values when new, which can
often be found on the label (if the seller hasn't conveniently removed it!).
They may also be available from Agilent by referencing the serial number
of the tube assembly, but Agilent probably would not release this
information except to the original owner.
<p>
When semiconductor fab lines shut down, the lasers often become
available at various stages of their life.  They appear on eBay and
from many surplus dealers at costs ranging from $25 or less to
several thousand dollars.  However, almost any of these may be
less than the cost of a rebuilt laser.  5501Bs, 5517As, 5517Bs, and some
5517Cs are widely available.  The 5517Ds are less common in working
condition possibly because they are the highest performance
common HP/Agilent laser still in use on state-of-the art fab lines,
so they tend to become available only when pulled from service
due to low power or associated (tube) failure..
<p>
If it were possible to have confidence in the operating condition and
life expectancy of a previously owned laser, it would represent a low
risk alternative to either a new or rebuilt one.

<p>
<h2>Rebuild Options</h2>

Note: I am not at liberty to divulge and/or am not even absolutely sure of
the names of the companies whose rebuilt laser(s) I've tested,
being acquired from a third party, so please do not ask.  There aren't
that many so a Web search should be able to locate them.
<p>
There are a few companies who will rebuild the tube assembly or sell you
a laser with a rebuilt tube assembly.  Although I have yet to see a typical
cost, the amount of labor involved (more below) would suggest that it is
a substantial fraction of the cost of a new laser.
And there is some risk since depending on the quality and
type of rebuild, the laser may not perform to spec or have a short life.
A semiconductor wafer stepper (one of the most common applications of these
lasers) is a very expensive piece of equipment often run around the clock.
Downtime is costly, and errors in fabrication only found after wafers
have been completed are even more costly.  So it's not clear at what point the
modest savings of a rebuilt laser installed once or twice over the entire
life of the machine can be justified against the risk.  Nonetheless,
some large semiconductor companies are known to have seriously considered
going this route and may be using rebuilt lasers in production.
<p>
The HP/Agilent tube assembly consists of the actual glass HeNe laser tube,
a permanent magnet, beam expander, and adjustable waveplates.  The part
that goes bad is the glass HeNe laser tube, which is mounted within the magnet
using a rubbery potting compound.  Rebuilding the laser tube will require
that it be removed from the tube assembly as shown below:
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="5517b-t2.jpg"><img  WIDTH=800  src="5517b-t2.jpg" border=0></A>
<h3>Major Components of HP/Agilent 5517B/C/D or 5501B Tube Assembly</h3>
</center>
<p>
This tube assembly was also from a 5517B, but there are some very minor
physical differences, which are mostly of little consequence.  However,
unlike the beam expander in the photo of the complete tube assembly, the
one in the disassembled unit is not easily adjustable, and this may make
it more difficult to match up with a non-HP/Agilent laser tube.  More below.
<p>
Rebuilding an HP/Agilent tube assembly can take two forms:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Regas the existing tube:</b> This requires extracting the glass tube
 from its potting compound in the magnet/optics assembly, breaking the seal,
 pumping it down to a high vacuum, baking out contamination, filling with
 highly pure helium and neon gases in a specific ratio to a specified
 pressure, and sealing it off.  If the vacuum system is ultra-clean and
 the gases are pure enough and the internal mirrors haven't degraded
 over 50,000 hours of use and the cathode is still healthy, the tube may work
 like new and last awhile.  Else, it may not work any better than before
 and/or may last a few minutes.  The regasing procedure takes several hours to
 several days and is very labor-intensive when done in low volume.  So even
 this "simple" approach won't exactly be low cost.  If the cathode
 has reached end-of-life and/or the mirrors have degraded, then these
 internal parts would need to be replaced, greatly complicating the
 entire process and driving up the cost.
<p>
 This glass laser tube is normally not considered a separate replaceable
 component, only the complete magnet/optics assembly (with the tube) at
 nearly the price of a new laser.

</center>
<p>
 The second view shows the glass nipple at the bottom that would need to be
 carefully cut in a dust-free environment and attached to the vacuum/gas
 handling system.
<p>
 Removing the glass tube intact from the tube assembly
 is the sort of thing that anyone in their
 right mind would only attempt once unless appropriate noxious chemicals
 are available to dissolve the potting compound without damaging anything
 else in the assembly (except that they likely rot internal organs).
 Mechanical removal using piano wire, saws, knives, and other instruments
 of torture is possible, though extremely tedious and time consuming
 for all the lasers with tubes that conform to the diagram, above.
 While the glass tube is physically the same for the 5517A, 5518A,
 and 5519A/B, it will be much more difficult - if not impossible -
 to remove intact since the outer casting is a single piece.  There are
 no front and back sections that can be separated, which makes access at
 lesat a little bit easier.  But, if the glass tube is to be reused as with
 regasing, the extraction must be done with great care to avoid
 damage to the glass envelope or internal components.  Otherwise,
 a hammer  and chisel will suffice. :-)
<p>
 The benefit of regasing is that most of the vital original parameters
 of the special HeNe laser tube are preserved, especially if it is replaced in
 the same magnet/optics assembly at the same orientation so that no
 adjustments of the waveplates are required.  Thus, the beam diameter and
 divergence, and the stability of the internal heater should be unchanged.
 However, without knowing the original isotope ratio and gas fill pressure,
 there could still be differences in optical frequency, split (Zeeman, REF)
 frequency, and other parameters.  While the cavity loss probably has the
 dominant effect on the REF frequency and may be the primary means of
 setting it for lasers up through the 5517C (3.0 MHz max), and probably
 even the 5517D (4.0 MHz max), both the isotope ratio and gas fill pressure
 have a dramatic impact on the optical frequency of the center
 of the neon gain curve.  And either of them (though especially the isotope
 mix) could affect the effective width of the neon gain curve, and this
 could impact the mode pulling that gives rise to the Zeeman split of
 the central longitudinal mode, and thus the REF frequency.
<p>
<li><b>Replace the original (glass) laser tube with a conventional HeNe laser
 tube and external heater:</b>  The physical process of doing this is
 straightforward: Find a suitable HeNe laser tube about 5 to 6 inches
 long, add an external thin film or wire-wound heater, and mount it
 inside the existing magnet/optics assembly after having removed its
 original tenant. <A HREF="#ref">[3,4]</A>
 This can be done (with difficulty) on your
 kitchen table and the laser will lock just fine and even produce a
 two frequency output, but there may be one slight problem: Using a
 conventional HeNe laser tube could result in a REF frequency that is
 substantially different than expected and likely too low, probably
 by enough to make the laser unsuitable for its original application.
 And, there can be other issues like rogue and/or impure modes as
 described in subsequent paragraphs.
<p>
 A typical conventional 6 inch HeNe laser tube is shown below:

<p>
 Then, a heater with electrical characteristics similar to those of the
 heater in the original tube must be installed on the exterior of the
 replacement tube:

<A HREF="hprhhlt1.jpg"><img  src="hprhhlt1.jpg" border=0></A>
<h3>Conventional HeNe Laser Tube with Heater, Ballast, and Cables Added</h3>
</center>
<p>
 The tube above was actually mounted in the magnet assembly from an HP-5501A
 laser (because that was available) and installed in a 5517D laser chassis
 (because that was available).  It locked and produced a usable output,
 though at a REF frequency of only 1.2 MHz.  Normally, a 5501A would be
 between 1.5 and 2 MHz, but due to the use of the standard tube, the REF
 frequency was lower.
<p>
 When a similar tube was installed in the magnet from
 a 5517B laser which normally has a REF frequency of 1.9 to 2.4 MHz, it
 produced a beat frequency of only about 1.3 MHz max.  But these two tubes
 had been selected for high output power.  When the rear mirror was
 deliberately misaligned to reduce the output power, it was possible
 to obtain REF frequencies from 1.5 to 2.4 MHz at somewhat lower, but
 still very decent output power.  This would exceed the HP/Agilent
 minimum power specification by a factor of 2 or 3 when set for the
 5517A or 5517B REF frequency, and still be comfortably above it when
 set for the 5517C REF frequency.  It might
 be possible to reach the range for the 5517D (3.4 to 4.0 MHz), though
 that my be marginal.  So, in a pinch, a standard tube might work, but
 would be a less than optimal solution due to the much lower life
 expectancy of the typical small HeNe laser tube - 12,000 to 16,000 hours.
<p>
 A tube with a mirror adjuster added was then installed in the magnet assembly
 from the 5517B laser shown above, and that was installed in the 5517B body
 as shown below:

<h3>HeNe Laser Tube with External Heater Installed in
 5517B Magnet Assembly in 5517B Laser Body</h3>
</center>
<p>
 After adjustment of the waveplates, it produced a good MEAS signal, in fact
 actually cleaner than that of the commercially rebuilt laser described
 below.
<p>
 But these were only lab experiments, never intended to find
 their way into commercial products or applications.  Nonetheless, it's
 quite possible that the rebuilt laser I tested was implemented in a
 similar way.  (More on its characteristics below.)
<p>
 The benefit of using a conventional HeNe laser tube
 is that it doesn't involve anything that
 is totally custom or require high vacuum equipment, ultra pure gases,
 glass working, and other sophisticated processing by the
 laser rebuilder.  When done on a small quantity basis, these can require
 substantial investment in high tech equipment and the skills to go
 with it.  Even if the laser tube supplier has to modify their "recipe"
 starting with the mirror parameters (reflectance and radius of curvature),
 but possibly gas-fill (He:Ne ratio and pressure) as well, that should be
 much less expensive and risky than developing the capability to rebuild
 tubes in-house.  And a company that produces HeNe laser tubes routinely, will
 have the experience to get the processing correct.  And since there's
 no need to save the original tube, it can be removed from the magnet
 assembly quickly using any method that works. :)
<p>
 But many parameters of the laser can change, and some of these may impact
 measurement performance and lifetime.  Two key issues with a laser like
 this that I have tested are the beam profile and jitter or "fuzz" in the
 MEAS signal, traced to the existence of "rogue" longitudinal modes in
 the laser output (modes that shouldn't be there) not oriented with the
 X and Y axes.  And life expectancy is a total unknown.
<p>
 The Zygo 7705 laser which has specifications similar to those of a 5517D
 is based on a very short tube of conventional design with a total length
 of around 10 cm, so perhaps 9 cm between mirrors.  It is a custom
 long life tube made by Zygo and is not available for non-Zygo uses.  The
 closest commercial HeNe laser tube is the Spectra-Physics 007 (same as the
 Melles Griot 05-LHR-007) with a cavity length of about 11 cm.  These
 are almost certainly no longer available, and even if they were, would have
 a relatively short life compared to the Zygo tube.  It's not known whether
 the Zygo tube has isotopically pure gases, but it probably does not and thus
 has to be very short.  The HP/Agilent tubes can have a much longer cavity
 length of 5 inches, most likely because they do have isotopically pure gases.
</ul>

<h2>Potential Issues</h2>

The following are the main things to check either by testing (where
possible) or getting data from the supplier or better yet, from their
previous customers.  A rigorous acceptance test procedure can identify
many of the issues that can affect performance.  However, specifications and
the experience of others must be used to predict long term stability and life.
Some of these will only apply to lasers with rebuilt tubes since most of the
fundamental parameters affecting performance are unlikely to have changed on
used lasers unless they have been tampered with or modified.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Beam profile:</b> The normal HP/Agilent beam profile is probably
 described best as a Gaussian that is cut off.  The 3 mm and 9 mm beams
 have the same shape as the 6 mm beam, but 1/2 and 3 times the diameter,
 respectively.  The easiest thing to do is to compare the beam profile of
 the candidate laser with a genuine one.  For many applications, the exact
 beam profile is not that important and was simply selected based on the
 desired interferometer optics.  But where long measurement distances
 are involved, for example, getting the maximum benefit from a larger
 diameter beam may be required.
<p>
 The beam profile on a used laser should not have changed unless someone
 attempted to adjust it or swap optics to convert from one beam diameter
 to another (e.g., from 6 mm to 9 mm).  Swapping standard HP/Agilent
 beam expanders doesn't usually cause problems.
<p>
 The near field beam profile of a laser rebuilt using a conventional HeNe
 laser tube was found to be noticeably different than that of an original
 HP/Agilent laser with the 9 mm beam diameter option.  There is a distinct hot
 spot in the center, very obvious by eye.
 While it should be possible to make this laser
 work in its intended application when new, it may be more sensitive to
 changes in interferometer alignment or may degrade more rapidly compared
 to the normal 9 mm beam profile. The profile looks more like a 6 mm beam
 where the edges are not cut off, as is normally the case with the HP/Agilent
 optics, rather than a true 9 mm beam where a higher power diverging lens is
 substituted in the beam expander and the center portion is enlarged by 50
 percent.  So, this may just be a 6 mm beam expander with a larger output
 aperture.  Thus, the behavior will be somewhere between that of the normal
 6 mm and 9 mm optics.  In principle, it should be possible to correct
 the beam profile by decreasing the focal length of the expanding lens
 in proportion to the ratio of beam diameters, assuming the collimating
 lens has a large enough diameter and appropriate aperture. 
<p>
<li><b>Mode alignment, balance, and purity:</b> If the waveplates are
 mis-adjusted, the output will suffer.  Test the alignment by
 rotating a polarizer in front of the laser and confirming that the
 Zeeman beat signal from a high speed photodiode or optical receiver
 (virtually) totally disappears when aligned with the X or Y axis.
 Test the mode balance by comparing the optical power through the
 polarizer when oriented with the X and Y axes.  The two values
 should be within 10 percent of each other.  Errors in mode alignment
 or purity will result in interference between F1 and itself, and F2 and
 itself in the interferometer optics.  The result will be low
 frequency level shifts of the envelope
 of the detected signal from the photodiode in the optical receiver.
 This may result in jitter in the MEAS signal similar to the presence of
 rogue modes not aligned with the X and Y axes of the laser
 baseplate described below.  Unequal mode balance will reduce
 the available optical MEAS signal level relative to laser output power.
<p>
 None of these is likely to change in a significant way over the useful life of
 the laser.  However, when the output power declines to well below the
 HP/Agilent spec'd minimum, amplitude ripple in the output power due
 to laser current ripple from plasma oscillations and/or the HeNe laser
 power supply itself, can interfere with a clean beat frequency.
<p>
<li><b>Rogue modes:</b> The axial magnetic field
 splits the neon gain curve in two and shifts one copy above and
 the other copy below the original center frequency.  These produce the
 left and right circularly polarized Zeeman modes.  However, since the
 two parts of the gain curve are shifted in opposite direction,
 the effective width of the overall gain curve is larger than the 1.6 GHz or so
 that would be expected, making possible these rogue modes even in a short
 tube.  Where a non-genuine laser tube is used, any number
 of deficiencies can result in low level longitudinal modes that shouldn't be
 there, and it's possible that these won't be aligned with X or Y.
<p>
 The basic setup used to evaluate HP/Agilent lasers is shown below:
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="tfiltst1.gif"><img  WIDTH=867  src="tfiltst1.gif" border=0></A>       
</center>
<p>
 Any HP/Agilent 5501A/B or 5517A/B/C/D/E/F/G laser can be very quickly
 evaluated for basic functionality.  The oscilloscope display was what
 initially called attention to the rogue mode issue.
<p>
 The effect of rogue modes that aren't aligned with the X and Y axes
 will be interference or baseband fringes that will result in low
 frequency level shifts of the signal in the optical receiver as the tool or
 stage is moved.  Essentially the same thing will happen if the normal
 Zeeman (F1 and F2) modes are not pure or are not aligned with the
 X and Y axes.  (Or the entire laser isn't aligned with its baseplate
 parallel to the X or Y axis.)  This may cause small transient errors
 in position while the tool or stage is in motion. However, the end-points
 may be accurate if the DC level shift resulting from the periodic static
 errors is ignored by the AC-coupled optical receiver circuitry.
<p>
 The MEAS signal may become fuzzy from duty cycle variations but only when
 the position is changing.  It will appear normal when everything is
 stationary.  While the exact effect on accuracy is not
 known, theory suggests that there could be errors of up to 10s of nanometers
 while the tool or stage is in motion, but no error at the end-points,
 though the settling time may be larger.  However, there could be ripples
 in the velocity (or other) function  that needs to be feedback controlled
 between end-points.
<p>
 The symptoms are as follows: The MEAS signal out of the optical
 receiver should be a clean square-wave with approximately a 50 percent duty
 cycle.  As the remote mirror or cube corner moves, the period/frequency of the
 square-wave gets smaller or larger due to Doppler shift but the duty cycle
 remains the same.  The system determines position by accumulating the
 relative phase difference between MEAS and REF, which is a square-wave
 of fixed frequency, the unmodified Zeeman beat output of the laser
<p>
 These two photos show an example of a normal MEAS signal with clean rising
 and falling edges, and a MEAS signal where there is a small amount of movement
 of the remote mirror.  In fact, it's likely that both the rising and falling
 edges are moving back and forth, but since the oscilloscope only triggers on
 the rising edge, that one appears sharp.  (The jaggedness in the falling
 edge is an artifact of the wiring termination.)

<h3>Normal MEAS Signal on Left; Corrupted MEAS Signal on Right</h3>
</center>
<p>
 The photos below made using a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI) show
 the longitudinal modes of a normal 5517 laser on the left with those of a
 5517 laser rebuilt using a conventional HeNe laser tube that had rogue modes
 on the right:

<h3>SFPI Display of Normal Single Mode Laser on Left; Laser wirh Rogue Modes on Right</h3>
</center>
<p>
 The large peaks consist of both F1 and F2, but the SFPI: is unable to resolve
 the difference in frequency of only a few MHz.  These are the normal
 split longitudinal mode of the Zeeman laser.  As can be seen, there is no
 evidence of any other modes in the left photo display of the normal
 5517 laser.  In fact, a genuine HP/Agilent laser will have at most 2 modes
 present as warmup when the modes are sweeping though the split neon gain
 curve, but supports only a single (split) mode when it is locked and centered.
 The display of the laser on the right with the rogue
 modes has a pair of smaller peaks on either side of the main peak for
 a total of 3 modes.
<p>
 The FSR of the SFPI is 2 GHz.  (The FSR or Free Spectral
 Range is essentially the longitudinal mode spacing of the SFPI cavity, and
 is thus the maximum extent in optical frequency over which there is no
 aliasing in the display -  it is unique.)  So, a 2 GHz FSR means that the
 longitudinal mode separation of the laser is either around
 667 MHz or 1.33 GHz (aliasing due to the 2 GHz FSR).  A mode spacing of
 667 MHz cannot be correct as that would imply a distance between
 laser tube cavity mirrors of almost 9 inches - more than the available
 space!  So, the smallest peak to the left of the large peak of the
 Zeeman modes actually goes with the previous large peak.
 And the other not quite as small peak to the right of
 the large peak of the Zeeman modes actually goes with the next large peak.
 Thus, the spacing of the rogue modes with respect to the F1/F2
 modes are approximately +/-1.3 GHz corresponding to a laser tube cavity
 length of about 11.3 cm or 4.4 inches.
<p>
 I did eventually confirm by visual inspection after removing the back cover
 and beam expander that the tube is indeed slightly less than 5 inches
 in overall length, which would be consistent with that cavity length
 after accounting for the thickness of the mirrors.  I also sent the raw
 beam across the room and confirmed that it is TEM00 and no higher order
 spatial modes were evident.  And, with very very careful adjustment of the
 SPFI alignment which causes its FSR to effectively double to 4 GHz, the
 display was as expected with one large central mode (F1/F2 displayed
 as a single mode due to the limited resolution of the SFPI) and two
 weak modes on either side around 1.3 GHz away.
<p>
 The diagrams below show why rogue modes can be present.  If the tube
 is too long and its longitudinal mode spacing (the FSR of the tube
 equal to c/2*L) is thus small enough, an adjacent longitudinal mode
 on each split neon gain curve may be above threshold and thus oscillate.
 One will be approximately 1 FSR above and the other will be
 approximately 1 FSR below the Zeeman modes.  (The distance is
 approximate due to mode pulling effects.)
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="zeemode3.gif"><img  WIDTH=914 src="zeemode3.gif" border=0></A>
</center>
<p>
 Normally, with the main lasing mode centered on the gain curve as it
 is here, there would be no chance of any other longitudinal
 modes having enough gain to lase in a tube with a cavity length
 of less than about 7 inches.  (The difference between the optical
 frequencies of the F1 and F2 modes is greatly exaggerated in this diagram.
 If drawn to scale, they would almost merge into a single line and can thus
 be considered to be centered.)  However, Zeeman splitting effectively
 widens the gain bandwidth for lasing with one part moving higher
 and the other part moving lower in optical frequency as shown above.
 So even a very short tube can produce rogue modes under some
 conditions.  The use of isotopically pure neon
 may be required to suppress rogue modes since it results
 in a much narrower gain curve and thus a narrower Zeeman split gain curve.
 Thus, HP/Agilent tubes with their 5 inch cavity length are rogue-mode-free.
 The cavity losses, most notably due to mirror reflectivity, also
 determine whether modes that are on the tales of the gain curve
 will oscillate.  So, a long tube with lower reflectivity mirrors
 could still be free of rogue modes, at the expense of output power
 in the Zeeman modes.  This is all a balancing act and unfortunately for this
 tube, it fell over. :( :)
<p>
 By rotating a polarizer in front of the laser while observing the SFPI
 display, it was possible to determine the orientation of the rogue modes.
 They were orthogonal to each-other and at approximately a 30 degree
 angle with respect to X and Y.  At this point, such a result was expected
 (actually hoped for since it was the only explanation that made sense!)
 but still surprising, as all the longitudinal modes of a laser tube are
 normally oriented along a single axis, or orthogonal to it, and these
 were off by 30 degrees.  However, this could mean that the rogue modes are
 elliptically polarized (before entering the waveplates) rather than
 being (nearly pure) circularly polarized like the Zeeman modes.
<p>
 The reason that the rogue modes at 30 degrees cause signal degradation is
 that some portion of each rogue mode passes through both the reference arm
 and measurement arm of the interferometer, and thus they interfere with
 themselves at the optical receiver, resulting in the baseband fringes.
 These change the level of the signal envelope, and confuse the receiver
 electronics, essentially by shifting the threshold that is used to convert
 to the optical receiver's digital output.  This effect is similar to that
 of misaligned or impure normal (F1/F2) modes.
<p>
 The signal jitter using a 10780A or 10780C optical receiver is
 probably a worst case.  The higher performance E1708A or E109A may be
 less susceptible to signal envelope level fluctuations.
<p>
 Note that even if rogue modes are present, if they are aligned with the X and
 Y axes, the only effect will be to slightly decrease the signal level relative
 to output power.  It's possible that careful adjustment of the waveplates
 could eliminate the effects of the rogue modes by aligning them with
 the X and Y axes.  It's also possible that rogue modes could exist in genuine
 HP/Agilent lasers but go undetected if aligned in this way.  Testing with an
 SFPI is not something that would be done routinely.  However, all tests
 I've made with HP/Agilent as well as Excel two-frequency lasers show that
 there is NO evidence of rogue modes when the Zeeman-split mode is centered
 and locked.  Zero, zip, null. :)
<p>
 By adjusting the waveplates, it was possible to produce a MEAS signal
 with little or no jitter.  In fact, by eye, the signal quality was
 such that on any other laser, it wouldn't warrant a second glance.
 However, when set this way, there was significant crosstalk between
 F1 and F2 indicating that their output was probably elliptically polarized
 rather than purely linearly polarized.  The signal should nearly disappear
 when a polarizer is aligned with the X or Y axis, but with this laser,
 it's amplitude was still 20 or 30 percent of the peak with the polarizer
 oriented at 45 degrees.
<p>
 The good news is that since the two rogue modes are already low level,
 they may actually disappear after the laser is used awhile and the
 overall gain (and output power) decreases!
<p>
 Rogue modes (at least those that are not aligned with the X and Y axes)
 should not be present in used lasers.
<p>
 For a much more in-depth treatment of this topic, see reference
 <A HREF="#ref">[5]</A>.
<p>
<li><b>Transient errors:</b> There can be any number of causes of faults
 that result in a momentary loss of lock or loss of signal.  In general,
 if a used HP/Agilent laser, or one with a regased tube, gets through the
 normal warmup and locks without problems, the chance of these is quite low.
 But if the tube is operating on the edge of stability due to a high
 dropout current, there is a chance of the discharge going out and restarting,
 though once this occurs, it generally will continue and get worse,
 especially as the tube heats up.  This is most likely to occur with a tube
 that has many thousands of hours under its belt, but could also be due
 to an incorrectly matched ballast resistance or a bad or improperly
 adjusted HeNe laser power supply, among other causes.  CAUTION: Do not
 allow a flickering or sputtering condition to continue as it can eventually
 destroy both the laser tube and power supply.
<p>
 However, due to the change in thermal characteristics of a laser rebuilt
 with a conventional tube, a loss of lock after READY has come on solid
 may not be unusual but the laser will eventually settle down and behave.
<p>
<li><b>Life expectancy:</b> The original HP/Agilent HeNe laser tubes are
 specially processed to result in an expected life of 50,000 hours.
 If the tube is simply regased, without replacing the cathode, the resulting
 life may be substantially shorter and possibly near zero.  End-of-life
 for many HeNe tubes is when the "pickling" - oxide coating - on the 
 cathode degrades or disappears.  At that point, the bare aluminum
 experiences significant sputtering which can even overcoat the mirror
 at that end of the tube.  So, simply refilling a tube may not even restore
 it for a few hours.  If the cathode is still good, then lifetime will
 depend to a large extent on the level of residual contamination from the
 vacuum/backout/gas fill operation.  Although a working HeNe laser tube
 can be made in one's basement, it takes a high technology setup to
 produce a tube that can last thousands of hours.
<p>
 Where a new conventional (but possibly modified) HeNe laser tube has been
 installed, the lifetime will depend on its construction and quality.
 Typical commercial HeNe laser tubes have an expected life of 10,000
 to 20,000 hours with some going to 40,000 hours.  But since a very
 small tube must be used in the the HP/Agilent lasers (due both to space
 limitations and the required longitudinal mode structure), the life could
 be much shorter.  The cathode area is small and the gas reservoir is small.
 Such tubes may have a life of only 5,000 hours, though there are exceptions -
 Small Zygo tubes last 20,000 hours.
<p>
<li><b>Beam alignment:</b> In either type of rebuild, the replacement or
 regased tube needs to be mounted and potted within the magnet/optics assembly.
 Even relatively large centering and pointing errors will be taken care
 of by the adjustments of the machine into which the laser will be
 installed, as long as the beam isn't cut off by the beam sampler aperture
 of the laser chassis.  However, decent alignment is one indication of
 care taken in the entire process.  But note that there are at least two
 sizes of beam sampler apertures and a tube with a 9 mm diameter beam
 cannot be installed in the smaller of these without very likely cutting off
 a part of it.  If the alignment is way off, this may be unavoidable even
 with the correct aperture.
<p>
 This should not be an issue with a used laser unless the tube assembly
 has been removed and reinstalled, or transferred to a different laser
 body, and then only horizontal alignment can really change unless something
 is preventing proper seating of the tube assembly feet.  Then it's
 just a matter of loosening the 4 mounting screws and readjusting it
 horizontally.  (On lasers with a pair of flat-head tube mounting
 screws, even changes in horizontal alignment are not likely assuming
 the two flat-head screws were carefully tightened before the other
 two screws.)
<p>
 For a rebuilt laser, a large pointing error most likely indicates poor
 attention to detail during the final alignment.  Depending on the design
 of the beam expander and access to its adjustments, it may be necessary
 to remove the tube assembly and perform the alignment with the aid of
 a jig that precisely positions the tube assembly with respect to a pair
 of apertures through which the beam should be adjusted to pass cleanly.
 However, since the tube will likely already be potted and fixed in the
 magnet assembly, it probably won't be possible to select the beam height
 and vertical angle independently so some compromise will be needed.
<p>
<li><b>Time to lock (READY LED on solid):</b> For a regased tube, this should
 be essentially unchanged.  But with a conventional tube and external heater,
 it may be longer, possibly much longer.  While this is normally of little
 consequence in a system run continuously, if it exceeds 10 minutes, some
 associated equipment like the HP-5508A Measurement Display
 will produce a Lsaer Fail hard error which will require power cycling
 the 5508A (which also power cycles the laser).  At that point, it will
 lock quickly since the tube will be near operating temperature.
<p>
 A rebuilt laser using a conventional HeNe laser tube required about 7
 minutes before the READY LED started flashing, and over 9 minutes
 for the READY LED to come on solid.  It just barely got in under the
 deadline.
<p>
 A used laser with adequate output power should lock in the normal
 4 minutes if it has the Analog Control PCB.  Only when the output power
 is very low and well below HP/Agilent specs, will locking time be
 affected.  However, lasers with the newest Digital Control PCB tend
 to take longer to lock - 6 minutes or more.
<p>
<li><b>Zeeman beat (REF) frequency:</b> The 5501B and each of the versions
 of the 5517 (A/B/C/D/E/F/G) have a specific range for this when new.  When
 a laser is rebuilt, it may change even if the same physical glass laser
 tube is replaced in the magnet/optics assembly, and will certainly change
 if a conventional tube is substituted.  The precise REF frequency
 (also called the beat or split frequency) is not
 critical and in fact, even for a given laser, will vary somewhat while the
 laser is warming up and may not even be the same from one power cycle
 to the next.  Furthermore, over time as the laser is used and the gain
 (and output power) decline, the REF frequency will tend to increase.  For
 a very high mileage laser whose output power has dropped way below the
 HP/Agilent specification (typically 180 &micro;W minimum), it may be 50
 percent or more above what it was when new.  But 10 or 20 percent is
 more likely where the laser still meets output power spec.
<p>
 So, a rebuilt laser should be checked to make sure the REF frequency
 is acceptable, either based on the model and options of the original
 laser, or based on those of the machine in which it is to be installed.
 A higher REF frequency translates into a higher maximum velocity capability
 for the measurement system, so a rebuilt laser with a higher REF frequency
 should be acceptable if the data processing electronics can handle it
 without producing measurement errors, or aborting due to detecting that
 it is out of range.  But the expected increase in REF frequency due to
 aging should be factored into the determination of whether it will
 continue to work correctly later.  A rebuilt laser with a short useful
 life will be no bargain.  However, if the REF frequency is below the
 spec'd minimum, performance may be unacceptable in speed-critical
 applications, or the machine may generate an error during self test and
 refuse to work at all.
<p>
 The actual REF frequency of a used laser should not be an issue except
 to the extent it has increased with use, which may be a tip-off to its
 future life expectancy.  Even if the output power is well above the
 spec'd minimum, an excessively high REF frequency may indicate that the
 original output power was much greater, and the laser is probably near
 end-of-life.
<p>
<li><b>Absolute optical frequency/wavelength:</b> Either type of rebuild is
 likely to result in a change to the optical frequency, and the corresponding
 wavelength used in the measurements.  The He:Ne isotope ratio and gas fill
 pressure have the most effect, which can be can result in a difference of
 up to several hundred MHz compared to the original HP/Agilent specifications.
 However, even in the worst case, the normal calibration process will take
 any frequency offset into account and environmental factors like ambient
 temperature end up being orders of magnitude more more significant.
 A one &deg;C change in ambient temperature results
 in approximate a 1 ppm change in wavelength, and thus measurement
 accuracy.  Environment compensation hardware and software takes this
 into account along with the initial physical calibration with respect to
 a known length standard.
<p>
 A rebuilt laser using a conventional HeNe laser tube was tested to be
 about 75 MHz above a healthy HP/Agilent laser.  This is still only about
 0.15 ppm difference, though it does represent a much larger deviation
 than even an end-of-life original HP/Agilent laser.
<p>
 The test setup is shown below:
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="tfiltst3.gif"><img WIDTH=964   src="tfiltst3.gif" border=0></A>
</center>
<p>
<li><b>Short term optical frequency/wavelength stability:</b>  Where the
 laser tube has been regased, this will probably be similar to that of the
 original.  Even with a conventional tube and external heater, the short
 term fluctuations in optical frequency (and thus wavelength) will probably
 be quite small assuming the laser is in a relatively constant temperature
 environment.  However, the external heater stabilized tube may be more
 sensitive to ambient temperature fluctuations, though still quite
 acceptable.
<p>
 A rebuilt laser using a conventional HeNe laser tube had a frequency
 variation over 8 hours of less than +/-2 MHz, and this is very
 conservative.  It could be much less.
<p>
 The optical frequency tends to decrease with use.  For a used laser, it's
 never likely to be so low as to not meet HP/Agilent specs for optical
 frequency, but this, too, can be used as a guide to the health of the
 laser.
<p>
<li><b>Long term optical frequency/wavelength stability:</b> All HeNe lasers
 drift in optical frequency as they age, mainly due to the decrease in
 gas pressure inside the tube.  This is probably the main reason that the
 long term specification for stability is an order of magnitude worse than
 the short term one.  Both types of rebuilds should be similar in this regard,
 and still be within HP/Agilent specifications.

<h2>Acceptance Testing Summary</h2>

With an arrangement similar to the one shown in the diagram above,
"Two-Frequency Interferomter Laser Tester", along with a polarizer,
laser power meter, and high speed photodiode, most of the following
tests can be performed in under 10 minutes.  However, it will be desirable
to run the laser for a few hours or more to make sure everything remains
stable, but this can be essentially unattended if the measurement
display catches laser loss-of-lock or dropout errors as does the 5508A.
(The only test that will require a somewhat more complex setup is
the one for optical frequency, and performing that is probably not
essential in most cases.)
<p>
Confirm that the +/-15 VDC power supplies have the required specifications
(voltage accuracy and current ratings).  It would also be desirable to
run everything on a power conditioner and/or constant voltage (e.g., Sola)
transformer to rule out incorrect or noisy power as a cause of unexpected
behavior, should any occur.  And, of course, if the cabling isn't idiot-proof,
double check the connections BEFORE applying power!
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Starting:</b> Except for the 5501B, a new or rebuilt laser should
 produce an output beam almost immediately, though many used lasers will
 require a few seconds to a minute or more to come on (though they will
 typically restart instantly if power is interrupted).  The
 5501B doesn't turn the laser tube on until the internal mirror spacing
 rod has reached operating temperature, usually about 2 minutes.  At that
 point, the yellow "Laser" LED signifies that the laser tube should be on.
 A slow start tube that doesn't light up within a few seconds may cause
 the controller to go through multiple attempts at locking, extending the
 lock time to much more than the typical 4 minutes.
<p>
 A laser that takes a long time to start but runs reliably may be perfectly
 acceptable, especially in applications where the laser is then run
 continuously for days or longer.  However, starting can be hard on the
 HeNe laser power supply, and some measurement display electronics will
 give up after a fixed amount of time like 10 minutes, and produce a
 non-recoverable hard error.
<p>
<li><b>Running:</b> Once the laser starts, it should remain on until power
 is removed.  Any dropout, sputtering, or flickering is a cause to reject
 the laser unless corrective action is taken.  But this is usually beyond
 the capabilities (or desires!) of the end-user.  It's essential to monitor
 the laser status until at least when it locks (READY on solid) since
 marginal tubes may only start misbehaving after they warm up.
<p>
<li><b>Locking:</b> Most of the 5517 lasers, the 5519A/B, 5519A, and 5501B
 typically lock (READY LED on solid) in about 4 minutes.  A bit less or a bit
 more doesn't matter, but a very long lock time could indicate other
 underlying problems, and may result in a hard error from some measurement
 electronics.  But it is normal for some versions of 5517 lasers to take
 10 minutes or more to lock.  A very short lock time could indicate that
 the internal temperature adjustment is not set properly, and the laser
 may lose lock after awhile.
<p>
 The 5500A/C and 5501A should lock in 10 to 20 seconds as they use PZT
 rather than thermal tuning, which is much faster.
<p>
 A healthy used laser should lock in about the same time as a new laser.
 However, a rebuilt laser with a conventional HeNe laser tube may take
 much longer to lock.  And a used laser with marginal output power may
 go through a few locking cycles before the power has climbed high enough
 to be acceptable.
<p>
<li><b>Locked output power:</b> The optical output power from the front of
 the laser with the normal (large) aperture should exceed the minimum
 specification for the particular laser.  For most of these, it's 180 &micro;W,
 but may be slightly lower (120 &micro;W) for some, like the 5517B and 5501A.
 For original HP/Agilent laser tubes, the output power will generally increase
 slightly after the laser locks and over the next hour or so, especially
 for used lasers with higher mileage tubes.  However, it is normal for the
 precise output power to differ slightly each time the laser is powered
 on based on which precise mode order (actual spacing rod temperature)
 to which it locks.
<p>
 Sometimes, the locked output power when new is printed on a label on the
 backplate of the laser.  Depending on the specific model and options and
 particular sample, this can range from around 250 &micro;W to over
 600 &micro;W.  How far the output power has declined relative to the
 printed value is good indication of the laser's usage, though this is not
 necessarily a linear function.  However, being near the minimum acceptable
 value would be a cause for rejection.
<p>
 For a rebuilt laser with a conventional tube, the output power may go
 <i>down</i> slightly as the mirror alignment changes slightly with
 temperature.  This doesn't generally happen with HP/Agilent tubes
 which use a rigid (glass or Zerodur) mirror spacing rod for alignment.
<p>
 Note that a measurement of output power should only be considered
 accurate once the laser has locked and READY is on solid.  Before then,
 it may vary by 25 percent or more due to mode sweep, especially for a high
 mileage tube whose output power has declined significantly compared to its
 value when new.
<p>
<li><b>Beam profile:</b> The normal beam profile for HP/Agilent lasers
 is along the lines of the center portion of a Gaussian with the sides
 cut off, not the typical full Gaussian TEM00 spatial mode of a common
 HeNe laser.  The beam profile won't change in a used laser, though the
 variation from center to edge will tend to increase as the power declines.
 But a rebuilt laser with a conventional tube may not have matched optics,
 so almost anything is possible.  To make it seem like there is more power, the
 rebuild company may used optics that pass more of the beam, resulting in 
 a hot spot in the center.  The easiest way to check is to compare
 with an original HP/Agilent laser with a similar size beam option.
 Two possible effects of a sub-optimal beam profile will be to decrease
 MEAS signal amplitude and make interferometer alignment more critical.
 For many applications, the exact beam profile may not matter, but for
 some equipment, there may be specific installation tests that will
 fail if the beam profile isn't close to the original from HP/Agilent.
<p>
<li><b>Mode alignment and purity:</b> When a polarizer (sheet polarizer
 or polarizing beam splitter cube such as from an HP interferometer) is
 rotated in the output beam, the MEAS signal from an optical receiver should
 be present at all orientations <i>except</i> in a small angular range centered
 around the X and Y axes with respect to the laser baseplate.
<p>
 Neither of these should change in a used laser.  But in a rebuilt
 (or new!) laser, alignment being off by more than a degree or so or
 would be an indication of bad quality control during final adjustment
 of the waveplates.  Lack of null points when the polarizer is aligned
 with the X or Y axes indicates crosstalk between the F1 and F2 optical
 frequencies and may also be the result of errors in waveplate adjustment,
 or that the waveplates were set up to eliminate the effects of rogue
 modes in a rebuilt laser at the expense of mode purity.  These problems
 should be corrected by the supplier, and if not possible, the laser should
 be rejected as both can introduce periodic static or dynamic measurement
 errors.
<p>
<li><b>Mode balance:</b> The output power in the X and Y polarized modes
 should be within about 10 percent of each-other.  While a slightly larger
 difference won't really affect performance, it may be an indication of
 an electronics problem resulting in a significant optical frequency offset,
 and possible loss-of-lock after awhile.
<p>
<li><b>Mode purity:</b> Using a polarizer, a fast photodiode, and
 DC-coupled oscilloscope, the check for a high modulation depth with the
 polarizer oriented at 45 degrees to the baseplate compared to the
 DC level along X or Y.  Excessively low modulation depth could be an
 indication of less than optimal setup of the tube assembly's optics
 (waveplates), or rogue modes in the laser tube itself.
<p>
<li><b>REF signal:</b> An optical receiver should produce a clean stable
 waveform (squarewave) with crisp sharply delineated tops and bottoms and
 rising and falling edges.  Any fuzz here may indicate amplitude ripple of
 the optical output.  This is most likely to be present in lasers with low
 output power, often as a result of plasma oscillations in the laser tube.
 Sometimes, these will disappear once the tube has fully warmed up and
 its output power has increased, but as with tubes that don't want to
 stay lit, corrective action may be needed.
<p>
<li><b>REF frequency:</b> The actual frequency should be within the lower and
 upper limits for the particular laser model (e.g., 5517C) and options.  If it
 is near or beyond the upper limit, this may still be acceptable though some
 equipment may be very fussy, or may simply be designed so close to the
 limit that the processing will fail.  However, a high REF frequency
 in a used laser could also indicate that it is high mileage, as the REF
 frequency tends to increase as a result of the decrease in gain and
 thus output power.
<p>
<li><b>MEAS signal (stationary):</b> This should be the same as the REF
 signal, above - clean and stable.
<p>
<li><b>MEAS signal (moving):</b> The MEAS waveform from the optical receiver
 should be clean, just like REF.  Movement of the "Target" will result in
 the period/frequency of the waveform changing, but at any instant, it should
 have no fuzz or other indication of instability.  Misaligned, impure, or
 rogue modes can result in both amplitude and duty cycle changes, with the
 most obvious result being fuzzy rising and/or falling edges (depending on
 the scope triggering).
<p>
<li><b>Transient errors:</b> The easiest way to check for these is to
 install the laser in an interferometer, or even simply with an optical
 receiver monitoring its output, and use the normal error detection
 capabilities of a measurement display like the HP 5508A to catch
 any loss of signal events over several hours.  Alternatively, a data
 acquisition system can be used to monitor the H and V polarized output
 power, and possibly the REF frequency.  Transient errors are relatively
 uncommon with these lasers, so testing for them is probably not worth
 the additional effort.  Any failure should be caught early on by the
 measurement electronics in the intended application.
<p>
<li><b>Optical frequency:</b> For a rebuilt laser, knowing the optical
 frequency is probably not very important as long as any machine calibration
 procedure takes the corresponding variation in wavelength into consideration.
 The optical frequency for rebuilt lasers may be quite different from the
 original, especially those using conventional tubes.
<p>
 For a used laser, the optical frequency relative to a similar known
 laser that is new, has seen little use, or has been run for a known
 amount of time, can provide another indication of how much use it has
 seen.  The difference in optical frequencies for a healthy laser will
 typically be only a few MHz, while one near end-of-life may be lower
 by 15 MHz or more.
<p>
 It's not clear that knowing the absolute optical frequency is of much
 added value for any of these lasers, except possibly to use it as a
 reference in testing other similar lasers in the future.  So, comparing
 with a low mileage HP/Agilent laser is as good as comparing with an
 iodine stabilized HeNe laser.
<p>
 (Although the HP/Agilent specification for laser wavelength changed by
 -0.000018 nm, an amount corresponding to an optical frequency increase
 of +14 MHz between the 5517B and 5517C, there is no evidence that an actual
 change was made in the design of the laser.  Testing shows no obvious
 difference in the optical frequencies of the 5517A, 5517B, 5517C, 5517D,
 or 5517E, or the 5501B.)
<p>
 However, since this test does require another similar HP/Agilent laser in
 known working condition, and a somewhat more complex setup to perform,
 the time, effort, and expense may not be justified if the other tests
 indicate good health.
</ol>
<p>
Note that the above list does not include the temperature set-point adjustment
as described in the HP/Agilent manual.  This should be valid for new, used,
or rebuilt lasers with HP/Agilent tubes.  But, it may need to be modified for a
rebuilt laser with a conventional tube.

A used or rebuilt HP/Agilent metrology laser may represent a viable alternative
to a high cost new laser or previously owned laser in uncertain condition.
For a used laser, it's critical to measure key parameters to determine
the likely condition of the laser.  The most important would be the laser
output power, followed by the REF frequency and optical frequency.
<p>
However, depending on the technique and quality of the work in rebuilding a
laser, a new set of isseus can arise, requiring careful acceptance testing
and periodic checks of performance.  So far, there is very limited data on
these lasers.  I have tested a 5517D that had a conventional tube installed
in place of the original HP tube, and a 5501B that I believe had its tube
regased (at the very least).  (I'm not entirely sure because I have not been
able to confirm with the supplier.  But the glass tube had obviously
been removed and replaced.)  The first of these lasers (used as the
example above) had very obvious beam profile and rogue wavelength
issues.  The latter appears to be normal in all respects, but its
expected life is unable to be predicted.
<p>
Even the laser with the beam profile and rogue mode issues could probably
be made to work in perhaps all but the most critical applications.  However,
there have been reports of an inability to follow the manufacturers
alignment procedure due to some aspect of this laser, so this would
need to be modified.  It's possible that readjustment of the waveplates
could align the rogue modes to the X and Y axes, and thus greatly reduce
or eliminate their effects on performance.  And of course, with any
laser that has been modified without HP/Agilent's strict quality control,
there would be some risk, so rigorous adherence to a weekly or monthly test
and calibration regiment would be essential in identifying and tracking
any changes in performance over time.
<p>
These same issues could occur with other Zeeman lasers such as those from
Excel Precision <A HREF="#ref">[6]</A>.  They
manufacture several lasers that are similar to those from
HP/Agilent.  However, metrology lasers from
Zygo Corporation <A HREF="#ref">[7]</A> are based on different
technology and already use HeNe laser tubes of conventional design, though
at present, custom built by or for Zygo to achieve long life.
<A HREF="#ref">[8]</A> There would still
be some areas that could change, but these would be limited to slight
changes in beam profile, and a likely shorter life. <A HREF="#ref">[9]</A>
